Masum Aziz unfortunately breathed his last today at 3:30 pm, at a hospital in the Capital. In a conversation with The Daily Star, the renowned playwright reminisced the wonderful memories he shared with Masum Aziz. ""I first got to know Masum Aziz through the popular drama that time named ""Somoy Osomoy"", written by Mamunur Rahsid. In this drama, he played the character of a Muhuri (clerk). His character garnered a lot of appreciation from the audience. I was impressed with his acting skills,"" said Masum Reza. Remembering the beginning of their wonderful friendship, he said, ""I was more amazed by how brilliantly he acted in the play ""Ei Deshe Ei Beshe"". Since then, we have been good friends as we work in the same industry. He also acted in a lot of my dramas.""""He last acted in my drama at a national event, which was held on December 16. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was also present at that event, and that drama was written and directed by me. He played the role of Puthi Pathok,"" he added.Masum Reza also mentioned that after that event, Masum Aziz's performance caught the attention of the state officials, and they started enquiring about him. Later, he got the Ekushey Padak for his contribution to acting.""I remember that he called me right after he got the award. He was very emotional. I still remember the sound of his voice that time,"" said Reza.As their names are almost the same, people often used to be confused about their names. Sharing a funny memory, he said, ""At one event, I was about to come to the stage. However, Masum Aziz bhai mistakenly announced his name instead of my name. The audience burst into laughter.""Reminiscing their last meet, Masum Reza shared, ""He was a great artiste and a singer. I last saw him a month ago. He was sick at that time. We talked about a lot of things that day. ""I am deeply hurt by his demise. We lost a gem in our country who was a good man. He will be remembered forever,"" he added.

/news/bangladesh/news/dscc-create-database-cleaners-3144696,DSCC to create database for cleaners,"Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) has taken a move to prepare a complete database of regular conservancy workers.DSCC will provide each of them with an identity card and prepare a database by collecting their NIDs, birth certificates, salary sheets, copies of appointment letters and phone numbers.Currently, there are 5,500 listed cleaners. The city corporation advertises the vacancies and listed workers contact them for a job.The age limit for applying for the role of a conservancy worker is 59.In the existing mechanism, many cleaners get the jobs by using fake identities. Waste collectors, who are older than 59, are also getting the jobs, taking advantage of the loopholes in the recruitment system.According to officials, around 250 cleaners had already submitted their data. The work to ensure the verification is currently ongoing.""Due to the loopholes, regular cleaning are facing a multifaceted crisis. Many use other's identity cards or fake their identities. As a result, new workers not getting jobs,"" said Marina Nazneen, DSCC regional executive director for region 1 and 7, also the chair of the committee responsible for creating the database.Meanwhile, regular cleaners have also welcomed this move.Robi Pal, a daily-waged conservancy worker in Ward-45 (Gandaria), said, ""It is indeed a very good decision. We are suffering a lot due to the lack for a proper identity card. Many of our seniors are working with juniors' identity, even after crossing their age limit.""Rahima Akhtar, another daily-waged worker in Ward-44 (Sutrapur), said, ""If it is really done, the scope of mismanagement will stop as currently many sweepers get the jobs by changing the names of their fathers or faking their identities."""

/sports/football/news/neymar-lands-spain-attend-trial-3144906,Neymar lands in Spain to attend trial,"Paris St Germain and Brazil soccer star Neymar Jr. and eight others go on trial in Barcelona on Monday charged with fraud and corruption over the player's transfer to Barcelona from Santos in 2013.Neymar and his father landed in Spain early on Monday morning and hopped in a van towards downtown Barcelona after the football player took the time to sign an autograph for a fan at the city's airport, a Reuters witness said.Spanish prosecutors are seeking a two-year prison term and a 10 million euro ($9.8 million) fine for Neymar. They are also seeking a five-year jail term for former Barca president Sandro Rosell and an 8.4 million euro fine for the club.The case centres on the claim made by Brazilian investment firm DIS, which owned 40% of the rights to Neymar when he was at Santos, that it lost out on its rightful cut from the player's transfer because the value of the deal was understated.DIS has demanded a much heavier five-year jail term for Neymar, fines worth 149 million euros in total, and for the player to be disqualified from playing for the length of any sentence handed down by the judge.Along with Neymar, 30 - who is expected to be at the court on Monday morning - the defendants include his parents, representatives of the two clubs, former Barca presidents Josep Maria Bartomeu and Rosell, and former Santos president Odilio Rodrigues.The court has ordered all to attend at 10:00am (0800 GMT) on Monday.""Neymar, with the connivance of his parents and the boards of directors of Barcelona and Santos, betrayed the trust of my clients,"" DIS lawyer Paulo Nasser told a news conference in Barcelona on Thursday.""The real cost of the transaction (between Santos and Barcelona) was 82 million euros, and only 17 million appeared as the official transfer,"" Nasser said.He said that Neymar was also not sold to the highest bidder, as there were other clubs that offered up to 60 million euros for his services.All the defendants have previously denied several times any wrongdoing.Law firm Baker McKenzie, who is defending Neymar and his family, said in a statement that they will argue that the Spanish courts ""lack jurisdiction to prosecute the Neymar family"" because the transfer involved a Brazilian national in Brazil.Neymar, a key member of the Brazil team that will be heading to the World Cup in Qatar next month, lost an appeal over the case in Spain's High Court in 2017, clearing the way for the trial.It was unclear if Neymar would be asked to stay for the whole hearing, which is expected to last seven days.Neymar was crucial to PSG's victory against arch-rival Olympique de Marseille on Sunday evening, scoring the only goal of the match. The team will face Ajaccio on Friday in Ligue 1, before hosting Maccabi Haifa in a Champions League game on Oct. 25.On Monday afternoon the court is due to hear from André Cury, Barca's former point man in Brazil, whose statement and details on the negotiations over the player are expected to be key for the case.

/sports/cricket/news/stunning-start-3144501,A stunning start,"Sri Lanka's T20 World Cup campaign got off to a disastrous start on Sunday as the former champions crashed to a 55-run defeat by Namibia in Geelong.Arriving as surprise Asia Cup champions, Sri Lanka had hoped to make an early statement against the African associate side in front of thousands of expectant supporters on a sun-bathed afternoon at Kardinia Park.Instead, it was Namibia soaking up their finest international win a year after storming into the Super 12s at the last World Cup in the United Arab Emirates.Bowled out for 108 after chasing 164 for victory, the 2014 champions Sri Lanka can afford no slip-ups in their qualifying matches against United Arab Emirates on Tuesday and the Netherlands on Thursday.All-rounder Jan Frylinck was man-of-the-match, top-scoring with 44 from 28 balls as Namibia put on a respectable total on a drop-in wicket.He then picked up the wickets of Dhananjaya de Silva (12) and captain Dasun Shanaka (29) with his left-arm pace.""I'm a little bit speechless at the moment, what we've just achieved is above what we thought we could do,"" said Frylinck.""Now I'm just very excited at this point in time.""Myself and JJ (Smit) got us to a competitive total and the bowlers just stepped up and it was unbelievable.""Sri Lanka crashed to 21 for three and their chase was all but over when Shanaka fell for 29, his team still 76 runs short with three wickets in hand.""I think the surface played really well but the execution was not there when it comes to their bowling,"" said Shanaka.""Once we lost three wickets in the powerplay, we were out of the game ... We've got a good team but it's all about the process.""When we're chasing 160 we need (the top order) to kick in. And the bowlers need to hit the right areas.""Meanwhile, in the second match of the day, led by Bas de Leede, Netherlands edged out the United Arab Emirates by three wickets in a tense low-scoring match.Skipper Scott Edwards stood unbeaten on 16 as the Netherlands chased down their target of 112 with one ball to spare.UAE pace spearhead Junaid Siddique returned figures of 3-24 and put the opposition in trouble with two wickets in the 14th over but Edwards held his nerve to get his team off to a win in round one.De Leede, an all-rounder who is a pace bowler, led the charge with his three wickets to keep down the UAE to 111-8."

/news/world/news/92-refugees-found-greek-turkish-border-3144576,92 refugees found on Greek-Turkish border,"Ninety-two migrants were found almost naked and bruised after allegedly being forced across the Evros river from Turkey into Greece, Athens said yesterday.EU border agency Frontex confirmed to AFP the arrival of the group in circumstances which the Greek ministry for civil protection said sent out an ""inhuman image.""""The Frontex officers reported that the migrants were found almost naked and some of them with visible injuries,"" said Paulina Bakula, spokeswoman for the organisation.Bakula, speaking from Frontex's Warsaw HQ, said Frontex officers worked with Greek authorities to provide the migrants -- mainly Afghans and Syrians -- with immediate assistance.She added the organisation had informed the agency's fundamental rights officer of a potential rights violation.Greek minister for civil protection, Takis Theodorikakos, accused Turkey of ""instrumentalising illegal immigration"" in the latest of a series of recriminations on migration between the neighbours.Theodorikakos told Skai television many of the migrants had told Frontex that ""three Turkish army vehicles had transferred them"" to the river which acts as a natural border.Ankara denied any responsibility and Interior Minister Ismail Catakli called on Greece to stop what in a tweet he termed its ""manipulations and dishonesty.""Greek minister for migration and asylum, Notis Mitarachi, had Saturday described the incident as a ""shame on civilisation.""Athens regularly faces -- and denies - accusations from NGOs and media as having on many occasions sought illegally to push migrants back to Turkey, sometimes using force.Last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used a UN address to accuse Greece of transforming the Aegean Sea into a ""cemetery"" with ""oppressive policies"" on immigration."
/environment/climate-change/news/7-ways-help-slow-climate-change-3144831,7 ways to help slow climate change,"While individual carbon footprints are dwarfed by global fossil fuel companies, we can do a lot to tackle the climate crisis and ""be the change we wish to see in the world.""Many of us bemoan our inability to limit the wildfires, cyclones and flooding that are being experienced with more frequency and intensity due to climate change. There is a belief that polluting fossil fuel companies cannot be stopped, that governments will not regulate them, that emission reduction targets will never be met.But individually — and in the end collectively — there are many things we can do to help limit the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that supercharge global heating. Transport generates around one fifth of the world's emissions, with road traffic as the worst offender.One easy way we can cut emissions is to decarbonize our transport by ditching petrol cars for trains, bicycles, e-vehicles, and, whenever possible, walking — the ultimate zero-emission transport.In cities, electrified transport options from e-scooters to e-buses are becoming a low-emission route from A to B. A petrol car pumps out over 10 times more carbon than an electric scooter — even when factoring in manufacturing and disposal emissions.For the roughly 10 percent of the world's population who has ever boarded a flight, favoring trains over planes can also have a big impact. A typical rail journey between European cities emits up to 90 percent less CO2 than an equivalent flight.Farming meat and dairy contributes around 15 percent of global GHG emissions — not to mention biodiversity loss, contamination of soils and pollution.When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this year said that emissions need to be cut by half by 2030 to mitigate global heating, it stressed that a shift to ""diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy"" had the greatest potential to lower greenhouse gases.So going vegetarian — or vegan — could be the way to go for those looking to mitigate their climate impact.A boom in climate-friendly plant-based meats makes that choice even easier.But so far plants only provide two percent of protein — though that's set to rise to 11 percent by 2035 and could be accelerated if more of us reduce our demand for meat and dairy, according to the Boston Consulting Group.School kids at the Fridays for Future protests showed it's possible to take a collective stand for the climate. Politicians might not be doing enough, but they have had to listen as climate concerns drive voting intentions at elections around the world — including recently in Australia, with the new leader promising to significantly raise climate ambition (even if many believe the target remains inadequate).And sometimes the courts also listen. In April 2021, young people from Fridays for Future successfully argued in a German higher court that a lack of climate action threatened their fundamental freedoms and was unconstitutional. As a result, the court forced the government to strengthen emission reduction targets — which it did a couple of months later.With climate ranking as the top issue of concern among a rising generation of voters, many are pressuring politicians on climate via protests, social media campaigns, or writing to local representatives.Demanding carbon neutrality by 2030 — the goal of a citizen initiative for a climate referendum in the German capital — is a good place to start.Burning fossil fuels for energy is the largest source of global GHG emissions. This makes choosing green electricity from clean, renewable sources such as wind or solar a great way to cut a key source of climate wrecking carbon. And consumers have already made a difference. By 2019 in the European Union, renewable electricity generation doubled from 2005, making up 34 percent of all electricity generation. This means that coal, the highest emitting fossil fuel, no longer supplies most of the EU's electricity.Those living in a house or even an apartment block can also try to install clean solar power on the roof, or electric heat pumps — where possible — as a substitute for gas heating. Some communities are even getting together to run their neighborhoods almost exclusively on renewable energy.Something as simple as turning the heating down can save a lot of energy. That's why the German government, faced with an energy crisis due to the nation's reliance on Russian gas, will limit heating temperatures to 19 degrees Celsius this winter in public buildings.Shutting down your computer at night and eliminating ""vampire"" power by unplugging idle electronics is another climate change busting action we can achieve today. Even easier is to simply turn off the lights when we aren't in the room.Using highly energy-efficient appliances — induction instead of gas stoves, for example — is another step forward. Better still, demand that your government switch off the night lights at monuments and buildings, a policy recently implemented in the German capital.Meanwhile, around one third of food grown globally is thrown away. This food loss and waste is a massive carbon emitter when the production, transportation and handling of food is calculated — food that ends up in landfills also generates methane, a highly potent GHG over the short term.In the US, annual food loss and waste creates 170 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent GHG emissions, and that's excluding landfill emissions. It's equivalent to the annual emissions of 42 coal-fired power plants.So, if we can't eat everything in the fridge, at least compost the rest — to fertilize the garden or for biogas.Meanwhile, pressure supermarkets to stop throwing away extra food, instead offering it to foodbanks or charities; or ask restaurants to offer ""doggy bags"" for uneaten food — both measures are included in a food waste law recently passed in Spain.   Trees are vital carbon sinks yet deforestation continues at alarming rates — logging of the Amazon forest, for example, rose by 20 percent in the last year.More than ever, planting trees is one of the best thing we can do as individuals to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere.While also cleaning the air, increasing biodiversity and maintaining healthy soils, trees too save energy — especially in cities where more plants on the street keep things cooler and reduce the need for air conditioning — according to non-profit Become Carbon Negative.So too in the winter, trees can shelter homes from the wind, helping to reduce heating costs by up to 25 percent."

/business/economy/news/taka-third-weakest-currency-south-asia-3144656,Taka third weakest currency in South Asia,"The taka has been rendered one of the worst-performing currencies in South Asia in the last one year because of the plummeting foreign exchange reserves of Bangladesh for higher import payments. The exchange rate of the local currency stood at Tk 107.5 per US dollar on October 10, down 25.6 per cent from a year earlier.The two other currencies – the Sri Lankan rupee and the Pakistani rupee – performed worse than the taka during the period: the Sri Lankan rupee fell by 79.3 per cent, while the Pakistani rupee was down 27.7 per cent, central banks data showed.Although the currencies of other nations in the region have performed better than the three countries, they have also faced depreciation substantially, with the Maldives being the exception. The country's currency has appreciated against the American greenback by 1.4 per cent in the past one year.In fact, most currencies around the world have fallen against the US dollar in the recent periods, owing to rapidly rising US interest rates and a more favourable terms-of-trade for the world's biggest economy caused by the energy crisis.The US dollar is now at its highest level since 2000, having appreciated 22 per cent against the Japanese yen, 13 per cent against the euro and 6 per cent against emerging market currencies since the start of 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund.Such a sharp strengthening of the dollar in a matter of months has sizable macroeconomic implications for almost all countries, given the dominance of the dollar in international trade and finance, said the IMF.Considering the current global uncertainty and the growing threat of recession, the ongoing volatility in Bangladesh's foreign exchange market may not come to an end soon.Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, warns that the ongoing instability in the foreign exchange market may continue in the coming days owing to the shortage of the dollar in the market.Foreign exchange reserves dropped to $36.3 billion on October 12 in contrast to $36.5 billion on September 29. The reserves amounted to $46.2 billion in September last year.In order to settle import bills and shore up the taka, the Bangladesh Bank has supplied $4.15 billion to the market so far in the current fiscal year.But Mansur said it might not be possible for the central bank to maintain the existing pace of dollar injection after three to four months as reserves have fallen substantially.""If reserves keep declining at the current rate, the central bank will not have much leeway to sell US dollars after three to four months.""Bangladesh is not alone when it comes to the declining trend of reserves. In fact, total foreign reserves held by emerging markets and developing economies fell by more than 6 per cent in the first seven months of this year, said the IMF.""If remittances and export earnings increase in the months ahead, the economy will get a respite from the current stress,"" said Mansur.But the export and remittance sectors are already under strain.Overseas sales slipped 6.25 per cent year-on-year to $3.9 billion in September, the first fall in 14 months, while remittances declined 11 per cent to $1.54 billion, the lowest in seven months.State-run banks are now purchasing most of the dollars from the BB to settle import bills opened by the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation.""We should take concerted efforts to halt the depreciation of the local currency to protect reserves. The government should manage loans from the IMF immediately to tackle the situation,"" said Mansur.The Indian currency has also lost its value in recent months, but the rate of its depreciation is much lower than the taka as the neighbouring nation allows its currency to move in keeping with demand and supply.But Bangladesh has not done it on time. As a result, the taka has suffered shock recently.Monzur Hossain, research director of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, says that Bangladesh has been able to manage its exchange rate more efficiently than Sri Lanka and Pakistan.""But the central bank should have managed it more competently than what it has done.""The BB had initially tried to manage the exchange rate in its own way but failed to do so as there was speculation in the market that the taka would lose against the US dollar.Hossain describes the ongoing practice of banks fixing the exchange rate of the taka for exporters, importers and remitters in line with their own formula as undesirable.""The main issue is that the stress in the foreign exchange market is continuing. And there is a strong possibility that the central bank may face difficulties in keeping the exchange rate stable in the days ahead,"" he said.""The supply of the dollar to the local market is not adequate compared to its demand because of the ongoing global uncertainty.""Salehuddin Ahmed, a former governor of the central bank, says that the taka has nosedived faster compared to the currencies in South Asia.""Although the economy is in good shape, the trend of depreciation is not a good thing for the country. It is worrisome that there are no coordinated efforts to fortify the macroeconomy.""For instance, he said, the country should take measures to stop money laundering and contain the private sector borrowing from external sources.Private companies in Bangladesh took foreign loans to the tune of $25.95 billion as of June, up 39 per cent year-on-year.""Besides, the central bank should emphasise disbursing more loans to the productive sector so that essential goods can be produced smoothly,"" said Ahmed.Some policymakers argue that the ongoing volatility will be managed within one or two months. Ahmed disagrees, saying the way of thinking to resolve stress is not the right one.Countries must preserve vital foreign reserves to deal with potentially worse outflows and turmoil in the future, recommended the IMF recently.""Countries with sound economic policies in need of addressing moderate vulnerabilities should proactively avail themselves of the IMF's precautionary lines to meet future liquidity needs."" "

Players, despite testing positive, will be permitted to compete.According to a cricket.com.au report, the ICC says there will be no mandatory testing during the event and no isolation period if a player gets COVID-19, instead asking team doctors to take the call and ""to assess whether it is appropriate"" for players to compete if they get COVID-19. The Australian Federal Government's mandatory isolation requirements for those who contract COVID-19 ended earlier this week.It is a similar attitude to the one taken by the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham earlier this year, where those who tested positive for the virus were dealt with on a case-by-case basis and not necessarily prevented from competing.During the 2021 T20 World Cup held in UAE where Australia clinched the title, there were strict bio-security protocols.

An anti-aircraft rocket could be seen streaking into the morning sky, followed by an explosion and orange flames, as residents raced for shelter.A pregnant woman was among three people killed in the attack on the residential building, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Ukraine's Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi said there had been deaths in other cities but did not give a full toll.Black smoke poured out of the windows of the Kyiv apartment building and emergency service workers toiled to douse flames.""I have never been so afraid... It is murder, it is simply murder, there are no other words for it,"" said Vitalii Dushevskiy, 29, a food delivery courier who rents an apartment in the blasted building.His flatmate, who gave his name only as Nazar, said they had tried to leave their flat only to find the staircase ""all gone"".Nearby, Elena Mazur, 52, was searching for her mother, who had managed to call her to say she was buried under rubble.""She is not picking up the phone,"" Mazur said, hoping she had been rescued and taken to hospital.Ukraine said the attacks were carried out by Iran-made 'suicide drones', which fly to their target and detonate. Russia's defence ministry said it had carried out a ""massive"" attack on military targets and energy infrastructure across Ukraine using high-precision weapons.""All night and all morning the enemy terrorizes the civilian population. Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app.""The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us.

All the assigned targets have been neutralised,"" the ministry said.Russia said its forces had held positions during ""fierce fighting"" in the Kherson region and also inflicted blows on Ukrainian positions in the Donetsk region.In Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Russia said it destroyed three US-manufactured howitzers and a crossing point on the Oskil River, set up by Ukrainian forces to move reserves and ammunition.The river flows south into the Siversky Donets, which snakes through the Donbas.Meanwhile, Russia yesterday said it opened a criminal investigation after gunmen shot dead 11 people at a military training ground near the Ukrainian border.Russia's RIA news agency, citing the defence ministry, said two gunmen had opened fire during a firearms training exercise on Saturday, targeting a group who had volunteered to fight in Ukraine. The ""terrorists"" themselves were shot dead, it said.The incident is the latest blow to President Vladimir Putin's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine and comes a week after a blast damaged a bridge linking mainland Russia to Crimea, the peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Russia's defence ministry said the attackers were from a former Soviet republic, without elaborating. A senior Ukrainian official, Oleksiy Arestovych, said the two men were from the mainly Muslim, Central Asian republic of Tajikistan and had opened fire on the others after an argument over religion.In the 24 hours to yesterday morning, Russian forces targeted more than 30 towns and villages across Ukraine, launching five missile and 23 air strikes and up to 60 rocket attacks, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Sunday.In response, Ukraine's air forces carried out 32 strikes, hitting 24 Russian targets.Fighting has been particularly intense this weekend in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, and the strategically important Kherson province in the south, three of the four provinces Putin proclaimed as part of Russia last month.Shelling by Ukrainian forces damaged the administration building in the city Donetsk, capital of the Donetsk region, the head of its Russian-backed administration said yesterday."

/sports/sports-special/t20-world-cup-2022/news/new-look-windies-search-winning-formula-3144791,New-look Windies search for winning formula,"After a rousing start in Group A over the weekend, the action at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 shifts to Group B on Monday with two-time winners West Indies taking on Scotland in Hobart in their first match of the tournament.It has been anything but smooth sailing for West Indies in the recent past. The squad that arrived in Australia have found the going tough, losing a T20I series against the hosts, and just about managing to see off a spirited UAE side in one of the warm-up games. Having underperformed in the previous edition, skipper Nicholas Pooran has his task cut out as he tries to rebuild West Indies as the powerhouse of T20I cricket, which they were, not so long ago.The current Windies squad lacks the stardust and depth of Daren Sammy's teams that went on to lift the cup twice. It also remains to be seen how much Shimron Hetmyer's absence, having missed his flight before subsequently being dropped, will affect the side. Hetmyer and his big hits will be sorely missed but the former champions have enough in the tank to start proceedings with a win. West Indies and Scotland's previous warm-up games were washed out due to rain. There aren't too many punters betting on Pooran's side going all the way in the tournament but they are expected to progress to the Super 12s.Scotland, meanwhile, come into the game on the back of a win against Netherlands. Richie Berrington's side had a memorable outing last year and will fancy their chances as West Indies have looked shaky with bat and ball in recent times. The Windies still have a bevy of big-hitters, including captain Pooran himself but their inexperienced bowling attack will still have to do very well to go far in the T20 World Cup.Since the 2021 T20 World Cup, Scotland haven't played much cricket and were comfortably outplayed when they clashed against New Zealand in the run-up to the tournament. They barely scraped through a win against the Dutch and will have to rely on Berrington, Josh Davey and Brad Wheal. Bowling remains a concern for the Scots and they will have to be on top of their game if they have to pull off a giant-killing act.Meanwhile, Zimbabwe and Ireland will lock horns in the second match of the day, to get underway at 2:00pm Bangladesh time.Having defeated Afghanistan in a T20I series two months ago, Ireland would be high on confidence. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, will certainly have a point to prove as they couldn't qualify for last year's T20 WC.The venue has hosted three T20Is so far with the first-innings score being 182. As the numbers suggest, the track is fruitful for batters. The bowlers will have a job in hand.The two sides have crossed swords in eight concluded T20Is so far with the head-to-head record being 5-3 in Ireland's favour.Ireland must fancy their chances of qualifying for the Super 12 stage as they played some quality cricket against Afghanistan. Skipper Andrew Balbirnie, Paul Stirling and, George Dockrell are veterans of this format and their numbers are impressive as well.Zimbabwe can't be taken lightly either as they also enjoy services of some potent players. Sikandar Raza will pose the biggest threat to Ireland."

Some Twitter posts by their friends and relatives said they had contacted their families yesterday.Asked about the prison fire, US President Joe Biden told reporters during a campaign trip on Saturday to Portland, Oregon that the Iranian government was ""so oppressive"" and that he was surprised by the courage of the Iranian protesters.Iran's foreign ministry said Biden had interfered in Tehran's state matters by showing support for the anti-government protests."

/opinion/views/the-overton-window/news/load-shedding-bangladesh-are-we-living-2022-or-1984-3145086,Load-shedding in Bangladesh: Are we living in 2022 or 1984?,"We are now more than halfway into the month of October. In July, Nasrul Hamid, the state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, said that the then ongoing power cuts in the country would not last long. He wrote in his verified Facebook page: ""Within the next few months, the second unit of Payra power plant and Rampal power plant will come into operation. Also, 1,600MW electricity will be imported from India's Adani power plant soon. All these will add more than 4,000MW electricity to the national grid.""In the same month, Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, energy adviser to the prime minister, assured people would get some relief from load-shedding from September onwards based on the same logic. At that time, this newspaper quoted experts who had questioned their claims. They asked what good adding more power generation capacity would do, when the resources needed to generate power were lacking – coal, for example. No one within the government batted an eyelash.In August, State Minister Hamid again said, ""The power situation will improve in the next month [September]."" September came and went, but the load-shedding problem stayed. None of the three new power plants that were ""slated"" to ""save us"" from load-shedding started operations.On October 7, the minister announced that load-shedding had decreased from before, but there was still a shortage of ""approximately 700-800MW per day."" According to data from the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Ltd (PGCB), however, both his claims were inaccurate. On that very day (October 7), power outage was 964MW, or eight percent of total demand. And people have already suffered from more load-shedding in October than in the previous month.All these remind me of a quote from George Orwell's prophetic novel 1984, ""The Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as 62 million. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to 57 million, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, 62 million was no nearer the truth than 57 million, or than 145 million. Very likely no boots had been produced at all.""To Nasrul Hamid's credit, he did come out only three days later (October 10) and admit that load-shedding had gotten worse. ""We hoped that from October there would be no load-shedding, but we failed as we couldn't find a solution to the gas shortage."" (Remember how experts had warned that the supply of resources for energy generation was among the main problems?) Hamid further added, ""I hope the situation will improve next month."" He has now set a new deadline for when the load-shedding situation would improve, albeit less confidently than before.But what about those who have been claiming for years that the Awami League government's energy policy over the last decade has been flawless? Weren't they the same ones who also categorically condemned anyone who identified any flaws in it – such as the folly of paying exorbitant amounts of capacity charges to the owners of idle power plants, all the while ignoring the need to modernise our power transmission infrastructure, and the government's refusal to explore domestic gas reserves, despite the fact that at least two studies conducted by foreign institutions (with superb track records) estimated the presence of a significant amount of gas reserves in Bangladesh?Will they come forward and admit they were wrong? Or do we shove their past boastings down Orwell's ""memory hole""?For years now, one particular issue we've heard the ruling party loyalists boast about regularly is how the party had transformed the country from one that experienced hours of load-shedding before it came to power, to one where there is very little (or none). In March this year, the government organised a celebration boasting a hundred percent electrification of the country. Only a few months later, residents of Dhaka who participated in the celebration were shocked to discover frequent power cuts not only during the day, but also at night – outside of the load-shedding schedules announced.Over the last decade, the government has spent thousands of crores of taka in the energy sector. The fact that we are now back to experiencing load-shedding like we did more than 10-12 years back is shocking. Whatever happened to those thousands of crores of taka? What did they achieve, aside from increasing our generation capacity, half of which we cannot utilise, and making a few (politically well-connected) people and companies who were handed favourable government contracts filthy rich? Did corruption eat away most of those thousands of crores of taka? If not, then why did the government need indemnity laws in the power sector over the years, and why was a recommendation recently brought to a parliamentary standing committee to indemnify officials of the state-run Petrobangla from legal proceedings?Recently, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) disclosed that the government (in reality, the people) had been deprived of about Tk 4,697 crore for 19 counts of irregularities by Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) and Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation. The irregularities include spending beyond the rules to buy goods and services at high prices; flouting the instructions of the finance ministry and the National Board of Revenue (NBR); and disregarding the Gas Sales Rules of 2004 and 2014, the Bangladesh Gas Act, 2010, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission, the Public Procurement Act, 2006, and the Public Procurement Rules, 2008.The overall lack of transparency in our energy sector over the years – which really is a microcosm of the general tendency of this government – has cost the nation dearly. And the government is now trying to push the cost of its irregularities onto the people – which is another of its common tendencies. But the people must resist. It's time to investigate the government's past decisions, to really identify what went wrong and what the irregularities were. Otherwise, there will be no getting out of the crisis we are in; in fact, it might only get worse.Eresh Omar Jamal is assistant editor at The Daily Star. His Twitter handle is @EreshOmarJamal

/sports/football/news/benzema-tipped-win-ballon-dor-tonight-3144786,Benzema tipped to win Ballon d’Or tonight,"Karim Benzema is the overwhelming favourite to win the men's Ballon d'Or at a ceremony in Paris on Monday and thereby become the first Frenchman to claim the most prestigious individual prize in football since Zinedine Zidane almost quarter of a century ago.There are 30 nominees, but the Real Madrid striker is the outstanding candidate after his remarkable performances last season helped his club win the Champions League and La Liga.Benzema scored an astonishing 44 goals in 46 games for his club including 15 in the Champions League.His exploits included a hat-trick in 17 second-half minutes against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16, and another away to Chelsea in the quarter-final first leg. He also scored three more goals over both legs of the semi-final against Manchester City.Benzema was named the UEFA player of the year in August, and he is living a marvellous twilight to his career with the World Cup to come.Formerly a pariah, frozen out of the France team for five and a half years because of his involvement in a blackmail scandal over a sextape involving teammate Mathieu Valbuena, Benzema has put that behind him and is playing the best football of his career with his 35th birthday approaching the day after the World Cup final.""What is most important to me is to win collective trophies. If you do things well on the field, individual awards will follow,"" Benzema pointed out recently.His victory at the Chatelet Theatre in the French capital seems an inevitability.""If they don't cancel it then he's probably going to win this Ballon d'Or,"" said Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski this week.That was a joke by the Pole, who would surely have been crowned in 2020 had that year's award not been cancelled due to the pandemic.Normal service was restored last year when Lionel Messi won the Ballon d'Or for the seventh time, but he is not even nominated this time after a disappointing season at Paris Saint-Germain.Cristiano Ronaldo is nominated but there is no Neymar on the list.Benzema aside, there are four other members of Real's Champions League-winning side: Vinicius, the evergreen Luka Modric, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and midfielder Casemiro, now of Manchester United. Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland, Lewandowski and Kevin De Bruyne feature too, but Benzema stands out by a distance.If Benzema wins, he will be the fifth Frenchman to do so, following in the footsteps of Raymond Kopa in 1958, Michel Platini (1983, 1984, 1985), Jean-Pierre Papin (1991) and Zidane (1998)."

/business/news/analysis-g7-fails-reach-intervention-deal-ease-pain-soaring-dollar-3145101,Analysis: G7 fails to reach intervention deal to ease pain of soaring dollar,"Japan and other countries facing the fallout from a soaring US dollar found little comfort from last week's meetings of global finance officials, with no sign that joint intervention along the lines of the 1985 ""Plaza Accord"" was on the horizon.With a strong push from Japan, finance leaders of the Group of Seven advanced economies included a phrase in a statement on Wednesday saying they will closely monitor ""recent volatility"" in markets.But the warning, as well as Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki's threat of another yen-buying intervention, failed to prevent the currency from sliding to fresh 32-year lows against the dollar as the week came to a close.While Suzuki may have found allies grumbling over the fallout from the US central bank's aggressive interest rate hike path, he conceded that no plan for a coordinated intervention was in the works.""Many countries saw the need for vigilance to the spill-over effect of global monetary tightening, and mentioned currency moves in that context. But there wasn't any discussion on what coordinated steps could be taken,"" Suzuki said in a news conference on Thursday after attending separate meetings of the G7 and G20 finance leaders in Washington.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made clear that Washington had no appetite for concerted action, saying the dollar's overall strength was a ""natural result of different paces of monetary tightening in the United States and other countries.""""I've said on many occasions that I think a market-determined value for the dollar is in America's interest. And I continue to feel that way,"" she said on Tuesday, when asked if she would consider a Plaza Accord 2.0 agreement.NO YEN SUPPORTIn 1985, a destabilizing surge in the dollar prompted five countries - France, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and what was then West Germany - to band together to weaken the US currency and help reduce the US trade deficit. Following the deal, named the Plaza Accord for the famed New York hotel where it was hammered out, the dollar shed roughly 25 per cent of its value over the ensuing 12 months.With no current US interest in engineering that kind of deal, other countries have to find ways to mitigate the pain stemming from a strong dollar, which has forced some emerging economies to hike interest rates to defend their currencies even at the cost of cooling economic growth more than they want.Emerging Asian nations have seen significant capital outflows this year that are comparable to previous stress episodes, heightening the need for policymakers to build liquidity buffers and take other steps to prepare for turbulence, said Sanjaya Panth, deputy director for the International Monetary Fund's Asia and Pacific Department.""The situation for Asian economies is very different from where they were 20 years ago"" as countries accumulated foreign reserves that make them more resilient to external shocks, Panth told Reuters on Thursday on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington.""At the same time, the rising debt levels, particularly in some economies in the regions, are a concern,"" he said. ""Some form of market stress cannot be ruled out.""The Bank of Korea delivered its second-ever 50-basis-point interest rate hike on Wednesday and made clear the won's 6.5 per cent slide against the dollar in September that drove up import costs played a key role in the decision.South Korea's central bank Governor Rhee Chang-yong said on Saturday he does not sense an interest among US officials to stem the dollar's strength through joint intervention.But he said some kind of international cooperation on the dollar may be needed ""after a certain period.""""I think a too-strong dollar, especially for a substantial period, won't be good for the Unites States either, and actually I'm thinking about the long-term implication for the trade deficit, and maybe another global imbalance may happen,"" he said.In Japan, the onus is on the government to deal with a renewed plunge in the yen, caused in part by the policy divergence between the Federal Reserve's determination to raise US interest rates and the Bank of Japan's resolve to keep borrowing costs ultra-low.At the news conference where Suzuki issued his warning about sharp yen falls, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out anew the chance of a rate hike.The dollar jumped about 1 per cent to a fresh 32-year high of 148.86 yen on Friday, testing authorities' resolve to combat the Japanese currency's relentless slide. The dollar/yen is now up roughly 2 per cent from levels when Japan intervened on Sept. 22 to buy yen for the first time since 1998.Japanese policymakers have said they won't seek to defend a certain yen level, and instead will focus on smoothing volatility.Masato Kanda, the country's top currency diplomat, told reporters on Friday that authorities were ready to take ""decisive action any time"" if excessively volatile yen moves continued.Even moderating abrupt yen moves, however, could be a challenge as Kuroda's assurance that the BOJ will keep interest rates in negative territory gives investors a green light to continue dumping the currency.""It's impossible to reverse the yen's downtrend with solo intervention,"" said Daisaku Ueno, chief forex strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.""Once the yen falls below 150 to the dollar, it's hard to predict where its depreciation could stop because there's no technical chart support until around 160,"" he said."
/world/europe/news/the-game-3144751,‘The game is up’,"Britain's Prime Minister Liz Truss yesterday vied to reboot her economic programme, but Conservative critics warned the party faces electoral oblivion under her crippled leadership.With even US President Joe Biden joining in attacks on her libertarian platform, Truss admitted it had been a ""wrench"" to fire her friend Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor of the exchequer on Friday.But writing in the Sun on Sunday newspaper, she said: ""We cannot pave the way to a low-tax, high-growth economy without maintaining the confidence of the markets in our commitment to sound money.""That confidence was jeopardised on September 23 when Kwarteng and Truss unveiled a right-wing programme, inspired by 1980s US president Ronald Reagan, of £45 billion in tax cuts financed exclusively by higher debt.Markets tanked in response, driving up borrowing costs for millions of Britons, and the Conservatives' poll ratings have similarly slumped, leading to open warfare in the governing party mere weeks after Truss succeeded Boris Johnson.""I think the game is up, and it's now a question as to how the succession is managed,"" senior Tory MP Crispin Blunt said on Channel 4.Truss has been forced into a screeching policy U-turn which cost Kwarteng his job. Bidding to placate investors, Kwarteng's replacement Jeremy Hunt is now warning that taxes may in fact have to rise, and is pressing for spending restraint by his cabinet colleagues even as Britons endure a cost-of-living crisis.The new chancellor met the prime minister at her country retreat yesterday to thrash out a new budget plan which he is due to deliver on October 31, effectively demolishing the ""Trussonomics"" programme that brought her to power.""It's going to be very, very difficult, and I think we have to be honest with people about that,"" Hunt told the BBC -- prompting a warning from trade unions of concerted strike action if he enforces painful cuts.""Truss has become a pointless prime minister -- an empty vessel with no policies or power,"" the Sunday Times editorialised.Up to 100 letters expressing no confidence in Truss have been submitted by Tory MPs, the Sunday Times and Sunday Express said.Opponents were said to be coalescing around Truss's defeated leadership rival Rishi Sunak and another one-time foe, Penny Mordaunt, for a possible ""unity ticket"" to rebuild the stricken Tories.But Johnson loyalists -- still seething at Sunak's perceived disloyalty towards the scandal-tainted former leader -- warned against a coronation that cuts out Tory grassroots members.Any new leader would face strong pressure to call an early general election, and the opposition Labour party has streaked far ahead in the polls."

The three women pleaded not guilty to criminal damage at Westminster Magistrates' Court during two brief hearings Saturday.Demonstrators from climate change protest groups Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil, which wants the U.K. government to halt new oil and gas projects, staged a series of protests in London on Friday.Just Stop Oil said activists dumped two cans of tomato soup over the Van Gogh oil painting, one of the Dutch artist's most iconic works. The two protesters also glued themselves to the gallery wall.Prosecutor Ola Oyedepo said the pair didn't harm the oil painting, which was covered by a glass protective case, but damage was caused to the frame.The painting, one of several versions of ""Sunflowers"" that Van Gogh painted in the late 1880s, was cleaned and returned to its place in the National Gallery on Friday afternoon.District judge Tan Irkam released the women on bail on condition that they don't have paint or adhesive substances on them in a public place.Police said they made some 28 arrests in relation to Friday's protests, and 25 others were bailed pending further investigation. On Saturday, police arrested a further 26 people after Just Stop Oil protesters blocked a major road in east London. Some demonstrators glued themselves to the road surface.Just Stop Oil has drawn attention, and criticism, for their disruptive tactics, including targeting artworks in museums. In July, activists glued themselves to the frame of an early copy of Leonardo da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" at London's Royal Academy of Arts, and to John Constable's ""The Hay Wain"" in the National Gallery.Activists have also blocked bridges and intersections across London during two weeks of protests against the U.K. government's approach to climate change.The latest wave of demonstrations came as Prime Minister Liz Truss ′ Conservative government opened a new licensing round for oil and gas operations in the North Sea and reversed a 2019 ban on fracking in England.

After that, this contractor will not be allowed to work in Bangladesh anymore.""Five people, including two children, were crushed to death when a crane toppled over, making a box girder segment fall on a private car on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway in the capital's Uttara.A probe committee, led by Neelima Akhter, additional secretary of the road transport and highways division, held the Chinese contractor China Gezhouba Group Co Ltd responsible for negligence that led to the accident.While the committee did not recommend any punitive action, the road transport and highways division secretary on September 4 said that the Roads and Highways Department – implementing authority of the project – will take action in line with the probe findings.The project's work resumed around last month -- one month after the accident.The BRT Line-3 is a Tk 4,268.38 crore project to build a 20.50km dedicated road for bus services from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport to Gazipur.It was originally supposed to be completed at a cost of Tk 2,037.85 crore by December 2016.The deadline was later extended to June this year, but the project made 78 percent progress by then. Another deadline was then set for December this year.However, project officials sought yet another one-year extension, the proposal of which is not pending with the planning commission.The roads transport and bridges minister further said the project started before he took office and its current disarrayed state is a result of flawed planning.He has instructed the project officials to wrap up the works at any cost, and so are now expecting the project to be completed by next March-April. Quader also reiterated that the Bangabandhu Tunnel in Chattogram and the first phase of the metro rail will be inaugurated later this year. He added that his ministry has also sent a project summary of opening 100 bridges across the country in a single day to the prime minister. "
/life-living/news/who-wants-be-millionaire-common-habits-people-large-bank-balances-3145066,Who wants to be a millionaire? Common habits of people with large bank balances,"A rhetoric, largely, because who does not want to be wealthy, right? Unfortunately, though, it is unlikely that life will take us all to the hot seat and make us rich while our friends and family cheer on. Does that have to mean that becoming a millionaire must remain a dream? Maybe not. A study that involved interviewing over two hundred millionaires over the course of five years revealed a list of common habits that all those with enviable bank balances share.A risk on new investments is something most of the millionaires in our study believed in and would regularly do. This does not mean throwing away hard-earned money on half-baked projects but calculated risks on high growth investments that had good chances to make them money in the long run. They usually, through experience and meticulous due diligence, were able to see potential in projects that were seemingly invisible to others, as well as come up with creative routes to make those risks pay.In this particular study, it was seen that 86 per cent of self-made millionaires worked more than 50 hours a week. However, they all knew their strengths and limitations. They worked to their strengths and outsourced the tasks they were less confident about to someone who was better at it so that they had more energy to devote to the execution part of things.A majority of millionaires dream big and then work to realise it. They call this process the ""dream setting"" and this is a tried and tested method to visualise goals and set about achieving them. It also allows them to focus on their dreams undeterred, instead of getting discouraged by other peoples' opinions of their plans.Successful people listen five times more than they speak. This helps them assert a wide range of perspectives and gather more ideas than they otherwise would. About 81 per cent of self-made millionaires stated that they actively sought feedback from others on a daily basis, including colleagues and those outside the office. The skill also makes them more empathetic to others, and strengthens their interpersonal relationships.People blessed with robust health spend less time away from work, and less money on medical bills. Adopting good lifestyle habits such as exercise and cleaner food lends a boost of positive energy to one's life and they use this energy and physical drive to power through their day and make the most of their working hours.Even if education stops at some point, one must constantly seek out opportunities for self-improvement. This can be anything from listening to audiobooks, reading biographies, learning a few new words every day or training for a new musical instrument or sport. Around 61 percent of all millionaires practiced new skills every day consistently. For them, it all came down to keep the brain active and working at increasing their knowledge base."

He will appear before Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court on November 21.Wearing a grey hooded top and grey jogging bottoms, Greenwood spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address in court on Monday.A product of the United academy, he has played 129 times for the club, scoring 35 goals and signed a new deal in February 2021, keeping him at Old Trafford until at least 2025.Greenwood made his England debut against Iceland in September 2020, but he and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden were sent home after a breach of the team's coronavirus guidelines.Nike suspended and later terminated its sponsorship deal with Greenwood, while Electronic Arts confirmed his removal from active squads on its FIFA 22 game after the allegations were made."

""We didn't execute our plans well.""I think we went for the yorkers and we didn't execute with low full tosses and half volleys. I think that's where it went wrong. I think if they had stuck to that hard length, wicket-to-wicket, like the Namibian bowlers did really, really well, it should have been different.""Sri Lanka had come into the tournament on the back of a fine run of form that saw them lift the Asia Cup. And the Lankans would have been confident given the nature of their crushing victory over Namibia in the same stage of the previous T20 World Cup a year ago.However, Namibia still made it through to the Super 12 stage in 2021, and captain Gerhard Erasmus said his side have taken great confidence from that experience at the top level.""I had a sort of childish belief last year before that game, and I think this year it was more something of we've played at the level and we can now mentally relate to this level; we can now physically and skilfully relate to this level,"" Erasmus said.""We've played India, Pakistan, all these teams before. We've seen it, we've tasted it, and because we've closed that gap by becoming one step closer to them and getting the physical feel for what it's like, I think that's really what gave us the belief this time around.""The Namibia skipper wasn't convinced by the idea that Sri Lanka got their bowling tactics wrong, but agreed with his opposite number that it was more a case of the Namibian bowlers executing the plans better.""We just went on to the field on an equal footing to the Sri Lankan side, and we just executed better on the day, I guess. That's the game of cricket, and I believe we did so for longer periods, hence the result.""If more opportunities like these arise for associate nations, they've shown over the years that they do close the gap and get to the level, and they're good actually quite quickly.""Focus will now switch to Tuesday's second round of group games, where Namibia could put one foot in the Super 12 stage with a win over fellow opening-day winners Netherlands.For Sri Lanka, their Net RR of -2.750 will be a big concern, and Shanaka will be hoping for a huge response from his side to get points on the board and correct that run rate damage."

/opinion/editorial/news/no-breathing-space-the-poor-3144771,No breathing space for the poor,"Whoever said that poverty is ""violence with tacit consent"" couldn't be truer at the moment. And this violence – in the form of relentless assaults on the wallets of the poor – seems to be getting out of control in Bangladesh. According to a survey of the World Food Programme, 68 percent of the people are struggling to buy food. The sky-high prices of food – which 88 percent of the surveyed identified as a major challenge – are getting harder to deal with: 64 percent said they took loan, and 29 percent of families said they used their savings, to buy food in August.Evidently, things have reached a point where the extremely high living cost has created a dystopian reality for the ordinary people.  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Evidently, things have reached a point where the extremely high living cost has created a dystopian reality for the ordinary people. With food and non-food inflation hovering near double digits, the poor could really use some breathing space. High inflation, according to experts, is affecting people's purchasing capacity, and thereby compromising their health and future. As revealed by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, food inflation reached 9.08 percent in September, after hitting 9.94 percent in August – the highest since FY 2012-13. Meanwhile, non-food inflation reached 9.13 percent in September. How will the poor survive in such a situation?They are being forced to spend less and less on food, as they can't cut spending on rent, utilities, healthcare and transportation, the costs of which have also jumped. While talking to this newspaper, some people described how they are struggling to pay for even the most basic food items. Rice, for example, is being sold at nearly record high prices. Prices of wheat, the second most consumed cereal in Bangladesh, reached ""new record levels in September, over 70 percent above their year-earlier levels"", according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The prices of most vegetables also remain generally high, while eggs, once considered a low-cost source of protein for the poor, are now out of reach for many.The government is apparently leaving no stone unturned to control the situation. For example, to increase the supply of rice and contain its prices, it has reduced import tariff and gave permission to 320 private firms to import 13.4 lakh tonnes of rice. The food directorate also signed contracts with India, Vietnam, Myanmar and Thailand to import 530,000 tonnes of rice under government-to-government arrangement. But continued inflation, unfriendly weather affecting domestic rice production, and the Russia-Ukraine war are proving to be too potent a combination to be contained with such measures. These are taking away for food gains made by Bangladesh.Evidently, things have reached a point where the extremely high living cost has created a dystopian reality for the ordinary people. While increasing food supply through ramped-up production and import is a priority, it is equally important to bring food prices within reach through greater market interventions. Also, as experts have suggested, it is important that the government creates a national relief fund, instead of separate food programmes and project-based initiatives, to provide long-term food assistance to low-income groups. True, some impediments like the Russia-Ukraine war and erratic weather will remain indefinitely. But their consequences can be minimised through implementing proper policies."

But we plan to take $4.5 billion and have discussed it with the IMF officials,"" said Rouf.He further said the loan has been sought from the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) funds, created recently to help countries build resilience to external shocks and ensure sustainable growth.""The IMF guidelines, however, stipulate that if you ask for loans from one of its components, you will have to take funds from its other components as well,"" he said, adding that Bangladesh also sought loans from the IMF's Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and Extended Fund Facility (EFF).The BB governor said they also had talks with the WB to get $1 billion loan -- $250 million from the Development Policy Credit (DPC) and $750 million from the global lender's Green, Resilient Inclusive Development (GRID) fund -- as budget support.He said the advantage of a budge support fund is that it's easier to get.

It was $46.13 billion on October 12 last year, according to BB data.At a press conference in Washington DC on Friday, Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf, deputy director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, said they would send a team to Bangladesh next week to discuss the country's loan request.""We also have seen the taka depreciate by about 20 percent. The reserves have gone down,"" she said, adding that the reserves were still at a comfortable level but had been on a downward trend.""So, with this, we are pleased that the authorities have been proactive in engaging with the IMF in discussing an economic programme that will contain measures to stabilise the economy and to avoid a further downturn in the economy,"" she noted.Seeking anonymity, a finance ministry official told The Daily Star yesterday that an IMF delegation will arrive in Dhaka on October 26."

Director Karen Maine's Rosaline, released on Hulu on October 14, 2022, offers new insight into the beloved tragedy by reimagining it as a romantic comedy. The movie tells the classic love story from the perspective of Juliet's cousin Rosaline (Kaitlyn Dever), who happens to be Romeo's recent ex-girlfriend. Crushed when Romeo (Kyle Allen) meets Juliet (Isabela Merced) and begins to pursue her, Rosaline schemes to foil the famous romance and reclaim her man.In the early years of the Renaissance, Italy was divided into several smaller city-states which often warred with one another. Rome was mostly in ruins—but Padua and Verona came under Venetian control, and cities like Florence and Milan flourished under early financial innovations spearheaded by the Medici clan of bankers and politicians. In the cities, politically powerful wealthy elites became patrons of the arts and a luxury class emerged quickly—but social inequality throughout the majority of the country was profound, and most of Italy belonged to the peasant class. Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, but the play knowingly wags its finger at the warring Capulets and Montagues, wealthy families who can't look past their own insularity and haughty self-importance to be good to one another, or to allow their children the chance at real love. Shakespeare drew on many poems, novels, and myths in the construction of Romeo and Juliet, but it also may very well have been a critique of Renaissance-era social inequality and the trivial concerns of the upwardly mobile elite. In the world of Romeo and Juliet, love is connected through word and action with violence, and Romeo and Juliet's deepest mutual expression of love occurs through their suicides. By connecting love with pain and ultimately with death, Shakespeare suggests that there is an inherent sense of violence in many of the physical and emotional facets of expressing love. In addition to being based on Shakespeare's original tale, Rosaline is also inspired by Rebecca Serle's 2012 novel When You Were Mine, which updates Romeo and Juliet to modern times in Southern California—with the inclusion of Rosaline as a main character. This leads to plenty of intentionally anachronistic choices, such as having Paris (Spencer Stevenson) talk about how Romeo is a ""tasty Montague,"" or including  a cover of Robyn's ""Dancing on My Own"". Incorporating modernity into a known piece of classic literature is not new territory at this point, but Rosaline has some amusing takes on the enduring love story. The movie takes the plot back to the past in Verona, with characters in period clothing. However, it throws out most of the Shakespearean language in hopes of reminding us that Romeo and Juliet at its heart is more accessible and hip than its old-fashioned text. The movie's take on love is far more light-hearted than that of the original tale. Romeo love bombs his way into Rosaline's affections, mostly by speaking in verse. He is a foolish and an impulsive romantic with a poor emotional attention span. Rosaline, comparatively, is an overthinking realist. She is especially entertaining when she playfully calls out the patriarchy of the Renaissance era—a time when she'd be nearly too old to marry and is looked down upon for speaking at the table or aspiring to be a cartographer. ""While you are off writing verse, I am off changing diapers?"" she asks Romeo, establishing her strong character. 
Yet, when Romeo starts pursuing Juliet, Rosaline spends most of her time trying to get him back, which involves sabotaging her sweet and trusting cousin and brushing off the advances of Dario (Sean Teale), a well-mannered soldier and potential suitor. In this light, the movie offers a fresh take, as Rosaline is the kind of underdog character we are curious to see move from the background to centre stage from the start.

While Rosaline starts out wanting to marry for love and be an independent woman in an era where such a thing was unheard of, the chemistry between her and Dario provides each of the two headstrong characters an equal opponent to face off with. The movie is surprisingly non-committal about whether their relationship is going to be forever or just for right now, which feels appropriate for them both. While Rosaline appreciates Romeo and Juliet's romance, she comments on the plot holes, the bizarre timing of events, and of course, the careless plan the star-crossed lovers come up with. That is what makes Rosaline work, though. It takes the premise of the famous play, and holds it up as the lofty idea that it is. Stripped of their romantic grandeur, Romeo and Juliet are kids who barely know each other and enact a convoluted, dangerous plan to be together. The movie is for anyone who loves to make fun of Romeo and Juliet just as much as they also love a love story.
It simultaneously points out the ridiculousness of Romeo and Juliet's situation, while not discrediting love as a concept.

Fascinatingly, the film is the most enjoyable when Rosaline and Juliet team up, like when they pick up local men at a pub. It is, thus, frustrating to watch the two main female characters pitted against each other in a fight for a man who really is not worth the effort. This story element is at odds with the empowering tone the filmmakers were clearly aiming for. 
Nevertheless, the movie successfully demonstrates that although Rosaline initially takes her cousin under her wing as a means of getting her to break up with Romeo, the two develop a bond that leads Rosaline to feel guilty about her deceit. To be honest, I was more invested in the burgeoning friendship between the girls than I was in either of their romantic relationships. Most of the plot is also quite predictable, and the movie's hit-or-miss tone offers a way heavier dose of parody than heart.
Nitpicks and disappointments aside, Rosaline ultimately makes a case for telling the lost stories of characters that never got their due. A witty reimagining, it offers an entertaining riff on Shakespeare for both current teens and those who were that age in the 1990s.

/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/breaking-down-the-backless-style-3145031,Breaking down the backless style,"Conservative people would say that backless dresses revealing from one's shoulder to the hip bone were offensive. But historical evidence would suggest that this specific style had been in existence from the times of the Mughals and maybe even before. Women baring and flaunting their beautiful backs have been an inspiration for hordes of world-renowned designers from Alexander Wang to Guy Laroche, and even Alexander McQueen. You name it and they have designed multitudes of evening dresses with only one theme in mind, the beautiful bare back.A little provocative, definitely bold, and sometimes even extravagant, the backless dress or blouse, offers a clever twist to any sort of regular styling. Imagine, a lady wearing a suit and suddenly, there is a backless twist to the attire that every person would now seem more interesting than ever.Saris are beautiful on their own, the wearer often plays with the blouse to make it even more attractive than usual. One can go sleeveless, add fluffs to the blouse, put on interesting necklines, or even go backless.Whatever style one chooses, it has to fit their personality. Anyone wearing a backless design must be comfortable wearing it, otherwise the style will only look vulgar and out of place.Most of 2019 and the entirety of 2020 saw plenty of drab and dull zoom-call dressing. Now that the world is reeling back to normalcy, it is time to experiment with more meaningful and interesting looks — especially ones that define our character. And finally, step out of the dull and dreary guise that had become a constant part of our personality during COVID times.Going backless is an interesting option — but of course only for the bold at heart. If the traditional backless style does not entice, more can be done with the styling — like placing pearl strings as embellishments or golden strands. The design options are limitless and maybe it is time we began experimenting on our own as well.Just to put things back into perspective, Miu Miu and Alexander McQueen have also designed backless suits for men and Timothée Chalamet made the backless for men even more popular, with a red-carpet appearance, a few months ago.While it may take a while for many of us to stomach such courageous designs, we can start by appreciating the backless styles for the ladies.Maybe there is much more to life than dressing only for zoom calls and selfies.

/opinion/in-focus/news/love-me-do-sixty-years-ago-the-beatles-began-play-3144636,"Love Me Do: Sixty years ago, the Beatles began to play","I: A ticket to rideSixty years ago, John, Paul, George, and Ringo released their first single, Love Me Do, on October 5, 1962. It was a Parlophone 7-inch 45rpm with the seal 45-R 4949. Side A included Love Me Do. Side B included PS I Love You. Both were Lennon-McCartney compositions. The face of popular music changed forever that day.When George heard Love Me Do on Radio Luxembourg- the first radio station to broadcast the song- he screamed so loud that his father, Harold, thought there was an accident in the house. Ringo was happy. A late recruit to the band, he went through so much that he was disillusioned and disenchanted with the music industry. John and Paul had a sigh of relief. Love Me Do was an original Lennon-McCartney composition. The Beatles saved their face. They could show something to their fans back in Liverpool.Love Me Do wasn't spectacular but it was a beginning. What made it special is that there was a lot of drama in getting the song published as the first Beatles single on Side A of a 7-inch 45 rpm. Sixty years later, knowing how 'Sgt Pepper taught the band to play' would narrate an old story again to those who lived and grew up with the Beatles through 1962 to 1970. It would also narrate to those who lived and grew up with the resonance of the Beatles since 1970.II: With a little help from (some) friends
John and Paul lived no more than a mile away from each other in Liverpool. Yet they never met. Paul recalls seeing a 'teddy bear boy' catching his bus a few times. Whether it was serendipity or not, Paul saw the same boy in a fish and chip shop some days later.
They finally did meet through a common friend, Ivan Vaughan, on Saturday, July 6, 1957. The venue was St Peter's Church. John was yet to turn 17. Paul had just passed 15.
John and Paul formed a natural bond through song writing. Both had started to play the guitar and were trying to write songs. Each also lacked something they found in the other, the perfect recipe for collaboration. And that was it. Soon after that first meeting, Paul became a member of John's group, the Quarrymen, which later evolved into the Beatles.



John and Paul would frequently meet at Paul's house at 20 Forthlin Road, which is now a National Trust heritage property. They skipped school to write songs. They both maintained an exercise songbook. Each page had a header, 'Another Lennon-McCartney Original'. Paul has preserved his exercise songbook but has safe-guarded its contents to the outside world. In a Rolling Stone interview from 2016, 'Paul McCartney looks back' Paul mentioned that the first 'Lennon-McCartney original' was a song called 'Just Fun'. The lyrics were indeed very innocent.
 







Love Me Do- First Press- Side A- Oct 5, 1962
""They said our love was just fun
     The day that our friendship begun
     There's no blue moon that I can see
     There's never been in history
     Because our love was just fun.""
The first Lennon-McCartney original that would see daylight would be a song John and Paul started in 1958 at Paul's house in Forthlin Road. In 1962, the song re-surfaced. 'With a little help from (some) friends', it started what later would be coined as Beatlemania. The song was Love Me Do.
III: Do you want to know a secret?
Brian Epstein, their manager, sent a telegram on May 9, 1962, to the Beatles who were performing in clubs in Hamburg, (West) Germany. Epstein had secured a recording contract for the Beatles with EMI. Love Me Do was the only song the lads thought worthy of a single with a Lennon-McCartney seal. The song needed to be re-done. It was 1962. The world had changed, and so did the Beatles in four years since 1958.
The lyrics of Love Me Do were simple. The word love appeared twenty-two times. The lyrics are said to have been influenced by Lewis Carroll's 'Alice, stop daydreaming do'. In the 1962 re-composition, John added the bridge, 'someone to love, somebody new'. This line was sung twice. Thus, love appeared twenty-four times. The original composition was in the A Key. The rhythm was like Buddy Holly's Maybe Baby. John and Paul decided to give the song a blues touch. They re-did the song in a G Key and slowed down the tempo a bit.
Pete Best, their drummer at the time, suggested to make the middle-eight different from the rest of the song by injecting a skip-beat. This speeded up the tempo and brought it back to normal in the middle of the song.
John had a different idea. He wanted the Beatles to be the first British band to include the harmonica in a song. As the story now goes, John used a chromatic Hohner harmonica that he shoplifted from Arnham, Holland during the first tour of the Beatles to Hamburg.
The ball was now set into motion. The recording at EMI was scheduled for Wednesday June 6, 1962. An adventure was just about to start. They would soon find out, 'home is behind, the world ahead'.
 







John Lennon’s ‘Stolen’ Chromatic Hohner Harmonica
IV: Helter skelter
Session One: John, Paul, George, and Pete (Best) were scheduled for a two-hour recording session (6-8pm) at EMI. George Martin was the producer and Ron Richards (who discovered the Hollies) was the co-producer.
When the Beatles arrived, Martin was in the canteen. Richards asked them to do Besame Mucho, of the Coasters. (Much to their annoyance), that was the first in a list Brian Epstein sent a few days before. It can't be proved now, if it was intentional or not, the performance wasn't up to the mark. Martin eventually rejected Besame Mucho.
The Beatles then suggested Love Me Do from Epstein's list. Something magical happened. The sound engineer Norman Smith (who would later produce the first two albums of Pink Floyd), told the tape operator Chris Neal to fetch George Martin. John's intro with the stolen chrome Hohner harmonica did the trick. It caught the attention of the studio.
Initially, Martin wasn't impressed. He didn't like the lyrics. Worst of all, Martin wasn't impressed with Pete Best. His drumming wasn't studio material. This put an end to Best's stint as a Beatle.
John, Paul, and George didn't get on well with Best. They took this as an opportunity to get rid of him. The problem was: who would tell Best? They asked Epstein to do the job. On August 16, Epstein called Best, ''I've got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in'. Two days later, Ringo officially performed with the Beatles for the first time. Ringo was with Rory and the Hurricanes. He was already filling in for Best when Best wasn't available or fell ill.
Why did Ringo accept the offer? Maybe because at the time, the Beatles were the only band in Liverpool that had a contract with a major label.
 







Love Me Do- EP- UK- Front Sleeve- Later Version- 1962
Not all went bad, though. Although Martin wasn't impressed with the performance of the Beatles, he did have an instinctive pulse that they could click. A second recording session was scheduled for Tuesday, September 4, 1962.
Session Two: The second session included John, Paul, George, and Ringo. The session was scheduled for three hours (7-10pm) with a rehearsal of three hours (2.30-5.30pm) to decide which songs would be on each side of the vinyl. Martin chose How Do You Do It? for Side A in advance. It was decided that Love Me Do would be on Side B.
This was unacceptable for the lads. John stood ground and told Martin that the Beatles 'disliked' the song. Martin hit back. Till they come up with a better song, Love Me Do would be on Side B. After reluctant efforts, How Do You Do It? was ready. Love Me Do was scheduled to start recording at 7.30pm. However, the recording ended at 11.15pm.
A new problem surfaced. Martin wasn't happy with Ringo's drumming. He privately suggested hiring a session drummer to John, Paul, and George. Ringo wasn't told about this development.
A third session was scheduled for the following Tuesday, September 11, 1962. Within the interim week, music publisher, Dick James discarded How Do You Do It? It was then agreed that the September 4, 1962 recording of Love Me Do with Ringo on the drums would be included on Side A. Half of the battle was won. Now, what about Side B?
Session Three: Ringo was dejected when he saw Andy White as a session drummer. He felt insulted when Ron Richards asked him to play maracas for percussion and not the drums on the recording of PS I Love You. Ringo was shattered when he had to play the tambourine while Andy played the drums on Love Me Do.
In the end, Ringo was happy. Side A would be Love Me Do; and Side B would be PS I Love You with Ringo on both sides playing the drums.
Initial Presses: Parlophone printed 250 demonstration copies for radio stations. These copies came in a 'Top Pop' blue sleeve. Sadly, McCartney's name was mis-spelled as McArtney. The first pressing (Oct 5, 1962) came with a red label and silver print with a silver Parlophone at 12 o'clock and a Parlophone £ logo at 3 o'clock. A second pressing was done in Autumn 1963 in a black label and silver print. There were different sleeves for the first UK and US covers of the single. Over the years more pressings were done. The last was on October 5, 2012, for the fiftieth anniversary.
And thus, '(sixty) years ago today, Sgt Pepper taught the band to play'.
V: Got to get you into my life
Three individuals contributed to the rise and lasting impression of the Beatles since Love Me Do.
The first was their (second) manager, Brian Epstein. Epstein had a sharp instinct in spotting an opportunity with immaculate timing. He knew how to manage the lads as individuals and their finances. He was clever in creating myths and visual images. Sadly, he died on August 27, 1967, a few weeks after the Sgt Pepper album. John summed it up: 'I knew that we were in trouble then'.
The next was George Martin. Starting with Love Me Do, Martin produced each of the thirteen original Beatles albums, with an entire Side B, composed and orchestrated by himself in Yellow Submarine. The last was their first sound engineer Norman Smith. From Love Me Do till their sixth studio album, Rubber Soul, Smith stamped the sound signature of the Beatles.
VI: The love you take, is equal to the love, you make
Standing at a crossroads of history, the Beatles changed the face of popular music forever with Love Me Do sixty years ago. Through Beatlemania (1962-1966) and then through Sgt Pepper (1967-70), in two distinct phases, the Beatles opened gates and avenues for later bands to explore and take popular music on more 'magical mystery tours'. Over time, The Beatles matured like fine cheese. This cheese will keep on maturing for quite some time.

The next was George Martin. Starting with Love Me Do, Martin produced each of the thirteen original Beatles albums, with an entire Side B, composed and orchestrated by himself in Yellow Submarine. The last was their first sound engineer Norman Smith. From Love Me Do till their sixth studio album, Rubber Soul, Smith stamped the sound signature of the Beatles.
VI: The love you take, is equal to the love, you make
Standing at a crossroads of history, the Beatles changed the face of popular music forever with Love Me Do sixty years ago. Through Beatlemania (1962-1966) and then through Sgt Pepper (1967-70), in two distinct phases, the Beatles opened gates and avenues for later bands to explore and take popular music on more 'magical mystery tours'. Over time, The Beatles matured like fine cheese. This cheese will keep on maturing for quite some time.

Brian Epstein, their manager, sent a telegram on May 9, 1962, to the Beatles who were performing in clubs in Hamburg, (West) Germany. Epstein had secured a recording contract for the Beatles with EMI. Love Me Do was the only song the lads thought worthy of a single with a Lennon-McCartney seal. The song needed to be re-done. It was 1962. The world had changed, and so did the Beatles in four years since 1958.The lyrics of Love Me Do were simple. The word love appeared twenty-two times. The lyrics are said to have been influenced by Lewis Carroll's 'Alice, stop daydreaming do'. In the 1962 re-composition, John added the bridge, 'someone to love, somebody new'. This line was sung twice. Thus, love appeared twenty-four times. The original composition was in the A Key. The rhythm was like Buddy Holly's Maybe Baby. John and Paul decided to give the song a blues touch. They re-did the song in a G Key and slowed down the tempo a bit.Pete Best, their drummer at the time, suggested to make the middle-eight different from the rest of the song by injecting a skip-beat. This speeded up the tempo and brought it back to normal in the middle of the song.John had a different idea. He wanted the Beatles to be the first British band to include the harmonica in a song. As the story now goes, John used a chromatic Hohner harmonica that he shoplifted from Arnham, Holland during the first tour of the Beatles to Hamburg.The ball was now set into motion. The recording at EMI was scheduled for Wednesday June 6, 1962. An adventure was just about to start. They would soon find out, 'home is behind, the world ahead'.IV: Helter skelter
Session One: John, Paul, George, and Pete (Best) were scheduled for a two-hour recording session (6-8pm) at EMI. George Martin was the producer and Ron Richards (who discovered the Hollies) was the co-producer.
When the Beatles arrived, Martin was in the canteen. Richards asked them to do Besame Mucho, of the Coasters. (Much to their annoyance), that was the first in a list Brian Epstein sent a few days before. It can't be proved now, if it was intentional or not, the performance wasn't up to the mark. Martin eventually rejected Besame Mucho.
The Beatles then suggested Love Me Do from Epstein's list. Something magical happened. The sound engineer Norman Smith (who would later produce the first two albums of Pink Floyd), told the tape operator Chris Neal to fetch George Martin. John's intro with the stolen chrome Hohner harmonica did the trick. It caught the attention of the studio.
Initially, Martin wasn't impressed. He didn't like the lyrics. Worst of all, Martin wasn't impressed with Pete Best. His drumming wasn't studio material. This put an end to Best's stint as a Beatle.
John, Paul, and George didn't get on well with Best. They took this as an opportunity to get rid of him. The problem was: who would tell Best? They asked Epstein to do the job. On August 16, Epstein called Best, ''I've got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in'. Two days later, Ringo officially performed with the Beatles for the first time. Ringo was with Rory and the Hurricanes. He was already filling in for Best when Best wasn't available or fell ill.
Why did Ringo accept the offer? Maybe because at the time, the Beatles were the only band in Liverpool that had a contract with a major label.
 







Love Me Do- EP- UK- Front Sleeve- Later Version- 1962
Not all went bad, though. Although Martin wasn't impressed with the performance of the Beatles, he did have an instinctive pulse that they could click. A second recording session was scheduled for Tuesday, September 4, 1962.
Session Two: The second session included John, Paul, George, and Ringo. The session was scheduled for three hours (7-10pm) with a rehearsal of three hours (2.30-5.30pm) to decide which songs would be on each side of the vinyl. Martin chose How Do You Do It? for Side A in advance. It was decided that Love Me Do would be on Side B.
This was unacceptable for the lads. John stood ground and told Martin that the Beatles 'disliked' the song. Martin hit back. Till they come up with a better song, Love Me Do would be on Side B. After reluctant efforts, How Do You Do It? was ready. Love Me Do was scheduled to start recording at 7.30pm. However, the recording ended at 11.15pm.
A new problem surfaced. Martin wasn't happy with Ringo's drumming. He privately suggested hiring a session drummer to John, Paul, and George. Ringo wasn't told about this development.
A third session was scheduled for the following Tuesday, September 11, 1962. Within the interim week, music publisher, Dick James discarded How Do You Do It? It was then agreed that the September 4, 1962 recording of Love Me Do with Ringo on the drums would be included on Side A. Half of the battle was won. Now, what about Side B?
Session Three: Ringo was dejected when he saw Andy White as a session drummer. He felt insulted when Ron Richards asked him to play maracas for percussion and not the drums on the recording of PS I Love You. Ringo was shattered when he had to play the tambourine while Andy played the drums on Love Me Do.
In the end, Ringo was happy. Side A would be Love Me Do; and Side B would be PS I Love You with Ringo on both sides playing the drums.
Initial Presses: Parlophone printed 250 demonstration copies for radio stations. These copies came in a 'Top Pop' blue sleeve. Sadly, McCartney's name was mis-spelled as McArtney. The first pressing (Oct 5, 1962) came with a red label and silver print with a silver Parlophone at 12 o'clock and a Parlophone £ logo at 3 o'clock. A second pressing was done in Autumn 1963 in a black label and silver print. There were different sleeves for the first UK and US covers of the single. Over the years more pressings were done. The last was on October 5, 2012, for the fiftieth anniversary.
And thus, '(sixty) years ago today, Sgt Pepper taught the band to play'.

""But we cannot refuse services. We have been managing by hook or by crook,"" he added.He also said that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Affairs does not want any crisis like it faced in 2019.So, all hospitals have to introduce separate unit for dengue patients and ensure supply of the necessary fluids, he added.Stressing on the dengue prevention, he said that they have asked the city corporations to conduct drives in the dengue hotspots.Prof Abul Bashar Mohammad Khurshid Alam, director general of the DGHS, and other health officials were present in the press conference."
/business/port-and-shipping/news/movement-containerised-cargo-drops-ctg-port-3144641,Movement of containerised cargo drops at Ctg port,"Import and export of containerised cargo through the country's premier seaport in Chattogram fell in the first quarter of the current fiscal year compared to that last year, indicating a slowdown in foreign trade resulting from global economic downtrends. Transport of imports and exports through the port also underwent a gradual downfall in the last three months till September.Overall container handling at the port also came down to its lowest in September.According to data from Chittagong Port Authority (CPA), 3.53 lakh TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) of import-laden containers were unloaded at the port in the last three months till September this year.This was 3.26 per cent less than that of the same period last year.Meanwhile, 3.67 lakh containers, around half of which contained exports, were shipped from the port, a year-on-year decrease of 0.95 per cent.In July, the first month of the current fiscal year, 1,23,653 TEUs of import-laden containers were unloaded at the port. It fell to 1,19,634 TEUs the following month and 1,09,702 TEUs in September.In case of containers shipped out, it was 1,19,128 TEUs in July, 1,30,378 TEUs in August and 1,17,476 TEUs in September.Overall container handling at the port also came down to its lowest in the last nine months to 2.48 lakh TEUs in September, which was 8.62 per cent lower than that in August.This figure takes into account all types of containers handled at the port, 19 privately-owned inland container depots (ICDs), Dhaka ICD and in the inland container terminal at Pangaon.The monthly average for container handling remained at 2.71 lakh TEUs in the previous eight months till August. The highest was 2.92 lakh TEUs in January.Restrictions imposed by the government on the import of luxurious items has led to a gradual fall in overall imports in the last few months, Bangladesh Shipping Agents Association (BSAA) Chairman Syed Md Arif told The Daily Star.Echoing the same, Bangladesh Freight Forwarders Association Vice President Khairul Alam Suzan said on the other hand, it was positive for the country as foreign currency was being saved.BSAA Director Muntasir Rubayat, however, said usually the country's exports remain low between September and mid-October every year and it is the same this time around.The major volume of exports for the winter season has already been shipped in July and August, he said.He admitted that feeder vessels that usually bring imports in the range of 1,200 TEUs to 1,400 TEUs were now arriving with only around 400 TEUs to 600 TEUs.Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vice President Syed Mohammed Tanvir said the import of commodity items have reduced noticeably in the wake of high prices in global markets following the Russia-Ukraine war.Tanvir, also the managing director of denim exporter Pacific Jeans, said placement of purchase orders for garments have drastically fallen in the last few months.Confirmations of fresh orders have also been slow to come by, which also prompted a drop in the import of associated raw materials, he said.He believes imports, alongside exports, may further drop in the coming months as not that many letters of credits were being opened.However, he hopes for the situation to improve from March next year. "
/business/news/oil-steady-recession-fears-counter-positive-chinese-signals-3144991,Oil steady as recession fears counter positive Chinese signals,"Oil prices were steady on Monday as China's continuation of loose monetary policy was offset by fears that high inflation and energy costs could drag the global economy into recession.Brent crude futures rose 17 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $91.80 a barrel by 0915 GMT, recovering from a 6.4 per cent fall last week. US West Texas Intermediate crude was at $85.67 a barrel, up 6 cents, or 0.1 per cent, after a 7.6 per cent decline last week.China's central bank rolled over maturing medium-term policy loans on Monday while keeping the interest rate unchanged for a second month, in a signal that the central bank would continue to maintain loose monetary policy.Beijing would also greatly increase domestic energy supply capacity and step up risk controls in key commodities including coal, oil and gas, and electricity, a senior National Energy Administration official said on Monday.China will further increase reserve capacities for key commodities, another state official told a news conference in Beijing.Oil found support from a combination of factors, including Chinese President Xi Jinping's comments at the Party Congress that reassured accommodative policies for the economy, a positive sign for demand outlook, CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng said.China is expected to release trade and economic data this week, with third-quarter GDP growth possibly set to rebound from the previous quarter, but 2022 threatening to be China's worst performing year in almost half a century.Meanwhile, a strong US dollar and further interest rate increases from the US Federal Reserve limit price gains.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Friday inflation had become ""pernicious"" and difficult to arrest, and warranted continued ""frontloading"" through larger rate increases of three-quarters of a percentage point.Inflation in the United States remains stubborn and growth in European Union countries is due to weaken to half a percent, Gita Gopinath, a senior official at the International Monetary Fund said on Monday.Oil supply is due to remain tight after OPEC and allies like Russia pledged on Oct. 5 to cut output by 2 million barrels per day, as a war of words between OPEC's de facto leader Saudi Arabia and the United States could foreshadow more volatility."

The ""Dilbar"" famed actress has been in the middle of a tug of war, as both the Women's Leadership Corporation and Mirror magazine vied to make her perform at their programme. Now, however, it is reported that the star will perform for only 40 minutes on the stage. Previously, Nora Fatehi was supposed to only come in December to take part in Mirror magazine's award show. However, she was denied permission to perform by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, mainly due to the dollar crunch.  A post shared by Nora Fatehi (@norafatehi)
When Mirror noticed that Nora had announced that she would take part in the Global Achievers Awards in November—which is being organised by the Women's Leadership Corporation—they sent a legal notice to Nora, stating that if she doesn't return the Rs 15 lakh advance, then she cannot perform in any events in Bangladesh.Finally, both parties came to an agreement and announced their decision via a press conference on October 15. Sharna Maria Mrittik, the founder of Women's Leadership Corporation along with the managing director of Mirror Group, Shahjahan Bhuiyan, was present at the event.In the joint press conference, they said, ""The misunderstanding that was caused by Nora Fatehi's visit to Bangladesh has been resolved. There are no more complications with her visit to Dhaka.""The organisers said that Nora Fatehi would be coming to Bangladesh on November 18 to attend the Global Achiever Award-2022 event. She will perform on the grand stage—performing in a total of three outfits—while also distributing awards at the programme. All of this, within just 40 minutes.Apart from Nora Fatehi, local artistes will also perform in the programme. However, the list is yet to be finalised.Earlier on, Nora confirmed her visit to Dhaka with a video message on Facebook. The actress posted that she is elated to be coming to Dhaka on November 18, and that she looks forward to interacting with the people of Bangladesh. ""I am looking forward to meeting you all. See you on November 18,"" said the actress. "
/opinion/editorial/news/where-did-the-du-house-tutors-go-3144776,Where did the DU house tutors go?,"It is disappointing to know that the majority of ""house tutors"" of Dhaka University, who are supposed to act as guardians of students, hardly ever visit their halls for months on end. A report in this paper has revealed that although there are specific guidelines for house tutors to visit their designated blocks or floors at least once a week, and hold meetings with students once a month, these instructions are largely ignored by most. So why are they not turning up?Reportedly, there are 150 house tutors for the men's dormitories and 73 for the women's dormitories. But after interviewing students, our correspondents found that many of them have not even seen their house tutors, let alone have meetings with them. Others have said their visits have been rare and after long gaps. This is very unfortunate, to say the least.Students in the halls need someone they can trust, and with whom they can share the problems they are facing. The conspicuous absence of house tutors points out to the general lack of control and accountability of the authorities over these dormitories.Students in the halls need someone they can trust, and with whom they can share the problems they are facing. The conspicuous absence of house tutors points out to the general lack of control and accountability of the authorities over these dormitories.Almost all the halls of DU are controlled by the cadres of Chhatra League, and ordinary students are compelled to pledge allegiance to them if they want to stay in the halls. As the media has reported, there have been incidents of physical and psychological abuse of students by some leaders of the student front who enjoy continuous impunity for their crimes. Students in the halls need someone they can trust, and with whom they can share the problems they are facing. The conspicuous absence of the house tutors points out to the general lack of control and accountability of the authorities over these dormitories.House tutors get residential facilities and honorariums for this post, which makes them obligated to carry out their basic duties. If they are willing to enjoy these benefits, why are they not willing to provide basic guidance and counselling to the students as required by the university guidelines?Compared to the men's dormitories, house tutors in the women's halls were reportedly much more proactive. Female students told this newspaper that their house tutors did come to the halls once a month, and often called them to their offices to listen to their problems and allocate seats relatively impartially. In a situation where politics dominates even when it comes to seat allocation, it is laudable that these house tutors of the women's dormitories are trying to live up to the role they have been entrusted with. This begs the question: if they can do their job despite political pressure, why can't those from the men's dorms follow suit?It goes without saying that the university authorities must investigate the reasons behind the continuous absence of these house tutors and their failure to contribute to the welfare of the students. It is high time students and their overall wellbeing were given priority, rather than maintaining the status quo that has proved to be so deleterious to campus environment in general."

/life-living/news/should-co-workers-be-more-colleagues-3145011,Should co-workers be more than colleagues?,"Working alone can be isolating. You spend most of your time with co-workers, and you are often judged for how well you perform. But what if there were a method to make work more enjoyable? What if the folks in your immediate vicinity were more than just co-workers? Would it be beneficial to your career?
The line between colleagues and friends has blurred, and the way we interact with each other is evolving. As a result of this, it is important to know where you stand in your current position or organisation.If you can maintain a professional relationship and work well together, that's great. But if you are unable to work together effectively — and this may happen when two people have separate values or goals in their work — then things are not going to go well for either of them.The first piece of advice is to just talk about work‐related subjects with co-workers. This implies that if you are discussing any movie you saw last night, it needs to be about your line of work (or a movie that could be relevant). Therefore, avoid discussing your weekend plans until someone specifically brings them up. It's also important to keep in mind that some topics should be avoided during workplace conversations, including feelings toward one another, personal information like birthdays and anniversaries, and topics that are too sensitive for even light talk. When you work together every day, you might assume that these things would not matter much, but they do affect how people view you. Avoid answering too many questions at once when someone asks you about yourself or a co-worker to avoid coming across as overly friendly to either person.If your boss likes you, it seems like the best feeling in the world. But if things go too far and s/he crosses a line, it's important to know where that line is for you.Be cautious about what you say; you might be tempted to tell them all their secrets and flaws, but do not do this! You need to keep some of your intimate secrets to yourself from them. Otherwise, they will be able to manipulate every single aspect of your life — and who wants that?As a workplace, we are all too familiar with the term ""colleague"" or ""co-worker."" But what does it mean to be a friend? A friendship between co-workers is possible if both parties are comfortable with it. The idea here is to not be afraid of closeness; if anyone tries to develop friendships with one another, there is no reason why this should undermine anything else happening inside of them.The company structure helps to maintain employee relationships sometimes. One of their fringe benefits may be Leave Fare Assistance. It consists of a compulsory paid annual leave scheme. As a result, when one co-worker goes on vacation, another one must step in and it will create a successor for the company.
It's critical to understand where you stand in the global shift in work culture. Workplace connections vary from country to country; in some, managers are permitted to discuss salaries with their staff more than in others. The workplace is evolving, but it's also crucial to strike a balance between work and life — which can be challenging if you are attempting to preserve a healthy relationship at home."

Two stations on the Purbachal route -- Nadda and Notunbazar -- will be built underground and used as an interchange, for passengers to switch between routes.Besides, another metro rail line -- MRT Line-5 (northern route) that will run between Hemayetpur and Bhatara -- will have an interchange at Notunbazar station of MRT Line-1, shows project documents.The MRT-1 will be the second of the six lines to be built in the capital and adjacent areas to ease traffic congestion and pollution.The government has taken a plan to build around 130km of metro rail network -- with both elevated and underground sections -- by 2030.Construction of the country's first ever metro line, MRT-6, is now going on to connect Uttara and Motijheel with a 20.1km elevated rail line. Its first phase, from Uttara to Agargaon, is scheduled to open in December.FIRST UNDERGROUND METRO RAILThe feasibility study of MRT Line-1 was completed in December 2018. The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council approved the project in October 2019.Of the Tk 52,561.43 crore, the government will provide Tk 13,111 crore and Japan Tk 39,450 crore as soft loan.The authorities had a plan to start the physical work of the project in December 2020. Later, they changed the starting date thrice, with the last postponement coming in September this year.Replying to a question about the delay, MAN Siddique said detailed design of the project was delayed mainly due to the Covid-19 pandemic as many foreign experts could not join.Asked whether they will be able to meet the deadline, Siddique said they were still hopeful.He said they would implement the project under 13 packages -- one for consultants and 12 for civil works.""We have already earned experience from the first MRT line [MRT-6] … If we are able to sign all contracts for underground and elevated sections, which are now at different stages, within the next six months, we will be able to meet the deadline,"" he added.He said after starting the depot works, they will start work for the underground routes from four places.The four boring places will be near the airport, Kuril, Notunbazar and Kamalapur in the capital.Asked about potential public suffering once project works start, he said people may face suffering around the station sites but that would not be for more than three to six months, because most of the works would be done underground.Revealing different aspects of the project, MAN Siddique in June last year said that 25 trains would be operated daily on this line. Each train to have coaches to carry 3,008 passengers at a time.It would take 24.5 minutes to go from the airport to Kamalapur, 20.35 minutes from Notunbazar to Purbachal and 40 minutes from Kamalapur to Purbachal.The trains will run at intervals of 2.5 minutes on the airport route, and 4.35 minutes on the Purbachal route."

Besides, the equipment for games were missing, tall grass and weeds grew on  the outdoor field. A good portion of the area was also grabbed in the absence of a boundary wall.All in all, nobody will believe at first sight that this was a recreational centre once.Rubayat Rahman, secretary of Saidpur rail workshop workers' union, said the place's downfall started when many workers of the workshop were forced to retire in  1991-1992,  by the then government.""The negligence towards the auditorium started then, The remaining 2,400 workers didn't have enough  free time to begin with, as new workers were not hired after the massive firing spree.""""The equipment gradually became dysfunction and the authorities didn't show any interest to get new ones,"" he said.Habibur Rahman, president of the  centre's management committee, said, ""The new batch of workers are more interested in virtual entertainment than using such centres.""Contacted, Shadikur Rahman, divisional superintendent of Saidpur rail workshop, said, ""We've realised the importance of such recreational places for our workers.

The team management, however, remained hopeful someone would score big with two warm-up matches providing the launch pad to find the required groove, and Siddons maintained they are close to finding the final batting order.Bangladesh's highest score of 173 for six in the recently concluded tri-nation series in New Zealand was usurped by Pakistan, with seven wickets and one delivery to spare. Thus, whether the Tigers are just below-par with the ball or with the bat, is highly debatable.The Tigers moved to Brisbane on Saturday and had their first practice session in Australia the day after, hoping everything falls into place as they prepare for today's World Cup warm-up fixture against Afghanistan. While the bowlers had their separate net session on death-bowling skills, they also batted a bit.""They had a long flight yesterday, so didn't want to work them too hard,"" Siddons said regarding the net sessions yesterday while talking to the media.""Well, they had a good bat. Lately they haven't had to bat with the top-order doing well up till the 10th over. We gotta keep working on them cause, at some point, we are gonna need them,"" he said about the tail-enders getting some sessions in with the bat.Bangladesh top-order is, however, the likeliest position to make or break the Tigers in this World Cup. While skipper Shakib Al Hasan and batter Liton Das have carried form to the warm-up matches, much is expected of the likes of Soumya Sarkar, Yasir Ali, Mosaddek Hossain, and Nurul Hasan. Soumya returned to the national setup after a long time while Yasir and Nurul, returning from injuries, have yet to establish consistency.The team had experimented with the batting order recently but Siddons said they are close to finding the right setup.""We will see next two games and we will get a lot closer to the final batting order. Having a team which haven't won a lot of T20s, we're still looking for the best mix and the best batting spots. We're getting very close.""Soumya was going through the gears with coach Sridharan Sriram yesterday. The left-hander had impactful starts at the 2019 World Cup in England and the management is now looking for big scores from the top-order.""Soumya hasn't made fifties or sixties but so didn't Sabbir [Rahman], so we're hoping that once these next two practice matches and the World Cup comes along, everyone is in good form,"" Siddons remarked.""I think they [players returning after a gap or injuries] are going well. We've brought in some new players that haven't been in the team for a while, as you probably know. So, they are finding that it will take a little bit of time to get up to speed with international cricket again, but today is an example of how they are going and they are going really well,"" the Australian said.The average first score at grounds like Brisbane was just above 162 in the Big Bash League (BBL) while at Sydney it was 182.""I don't think we're going to need 200 here.

/business/economy/news/half-smes-pay-bribe-essential-services-study-3144436,Half of SMEs pay bribe for essential services: study,"More than half of the small industries in Bangladesh have to pay bribes for obtaining essential services, including availing and renewing licences, using public utilities such as gas and power, obtaining a tax identification number, and value-added tax certificates, according to a study.The Center for Governance Studies (CGS), in partnership with the Center for International Business Enterprise, carried out the study between mid-October and mid-December in 2021 to know the status of small-and-medium enterprises (SME) in Bangladesh, the CGS said in a press release yesterday.The survey was conducted among 800 SMEs with an evenly matched number from the manufacturing and service sectors.In terms of perception, almost nine out of ten SMEs believe corruption is pervasive in the SME sector, the CGS said.Some 62.4 per cent believe that corruption is well-rooted in the system, and an even higher number at 71.3 per cent believe that resorting to corruption can increase market competitiveness.More than half of the respondents believe that restrictive government regulations encourage corruption, and this opinion is especially prevalent among smaller businesses.Because of these perceptions, 61 per cent of the surveyed SMEs choose to bypass regulations and operate informally, it added.According to the majority of respondents, the desire for money or possessions as well as a lack of transparency at the higher government level inspires this systemic corruption but they also listed a slew of other contributing causes.And despite the prevalence of corruption, enthusiasm for submitting complaints to authorities remains low."
/business/global-economy/news/seoul-ease-restrictions-foreign-workers-3144496,Seoul to ease restrictions on foreign workers,"Visa regulations for foreign workers in the agricultural and fisheries sectors will be eased as part of efforts to address labor shortages in rural areas.According to the advance notice of legislation the Ministry of Justice announced Thursday, visa issuance regulations will be eased for workers in those sectors.Foreigners who have stayed in South Korea for longer than five years on E-9 non-professional employment visas or E-10 maritime crew visas cannot apply for visa issuance certificates, but the revised law will subtract the additional days they have stayed due to the pandemic when counting how long they have been here.In addition, the number of jobs available for foreigners with H-2 visas will increase. The H-2 visa is a visiting worker's visa issued mainly to Korean Chinese.To cope with the drastic rural population decline, a new regulation designed to ease employment restrictions on foreign residents and grant permanent residency to people who have made special contributions to the public interest is included.When local governments comprehensively analyse the industrial structure, job status within the region, and characteristics of a local universities and submit the reports to the Justice Ministry, the ministry will issue visas to foreigners considering the demand in the region.""Rapid population decrease and shrinking local cities are an imminent reality. The revision is to pre-emptively respond to that danger,"" said the official from Justice Ministry on Thursday."
/business/economy/news/the-converging-themes-business-transformation-3144621,The converging themes for business transformation,"Business executives are frequently exposed to various evolving trends, and quite often, they need to distinguish between hype and reality. For example, the 'metaverse' is a popular topic today. People representing a wide gamut of stakeholders are talking about it.  While it is uncertain how the whole concept of the metaverse will evolve in the future and start delivering business benefits, it is important to understand that it is grounded in a few foundational technologies that have gradually matured over the years.The advancement and convergence of these foundational technologies are helping create new themes that are aimed at solving important problems. A seasoned business leader must thus spend time to understand such foundation blocks, the opportunities arising through their convergence, and the themes emerging out of such convergences that can solve business problems.As we continue to witness unprecedented technological advancements, PwC has identified six convergence themes: automating trust, extended reality, immersive interfaces, working autonomy, digital reflection and hyperconnected networks. Instead of getting overwhelmed by each new hype, business leaders need to understand these themes and their importance in their businesses.Automating trust: To automate trust, technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain can be combined to ensure the authenticity of data, the identity of participants and security of transactions. This will enable these technologies to provide automated trust in physical, digital and human assets.Extended reality (XR): XR merges the physical and virtual worlds by using foundational technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR). Although its primary use cases belong to the entertainment sector, many research and development (R&D) organisations are finding this theme useful to enhance their capabilities to design newer products. According to a PwC estimate, XR can deliver a $1.5-trillion boost to the global economy by 2030.Immersive interfaces: These are the next frontier of conversational interfaces, along with XR. Immersive interfaces enable more natural and frictionless interactions between humans and machines. This theme uses various human sensory inputs – auditory, tactual and visual – and merges those with other human attributes, such as emotions, to maximise the immersive experience for humans in the digital world.Working autonomy: Automation has transitioned from a point solution to a broader definition of automating workflows and material flows. Working autonomy integrated with AI enables learning from its past behaviours and outcomes, thereby improving the degree of automation over time.Digital reflection: It is a virtual reflection of complex, interdependent physical processes and interactions.Hyperconnected networks: Such networks rely on an infrastructure of networks and sensors to process information at high speeds in order to intelligently connect numerous humans and machines. They leverage technologies like 5G and other low-latency network infrastructures.These themes are expected to lead the next wave of tech-led transformation for businesses around the world. For business executives, it will always be important to develop a comprehensive understanding of these themes in order to lead organisational transformation. Many organisations have already set out on this journey of transformation.The author is a partner at PwC. The views are his own."

/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/russia-launches-major-attack-ukrainian-infrastructure-3-killed-3145081,"Russia launches major attack on Ukrainian infrastructure, 3 killed","Waves of explosive-laden suicide drones struck Ukraine's capital Monday, setting buildings ablaze and sending people scurrying for shelter or attempting to shoot down the kamikazes — a week after Russia unleashed its most widespread strikes against the country in months.Air attacks in central Kyiv had become a rarity in recent months, and the concentrated use of drones, their blasts echoing across the city, sowed terror and frayed nerves. One of the drones slammed into a residential building, killing three people, said the deputy head of the president's office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Energy facilities were also among the targets.Drones used in the attack appeared to include Iranian-made Shaheds. Previous Russian airstrikes on Kyiv were mostly with missiles. Intense, sustained bursts of gunfire rang out Monday as the drones hummed overhead, apparently soldiers trying to shoot them down. Others headed for shelter — though city life quickly resumed in a country that has become grimly accustomed to attacks.In what many fear could become more common occurrences in urban centers nearly eight months into the war, the barrage came in successive waves of 28 drones, Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Five of them plunged into Kyiv itself, said Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.In the Kyiv region, 13 or more were shot down, all of them as they flew in from the south, said a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yurii Ihnat.One strike appeared to target the city's heating network, hitting an operations center. Another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other. In addition to the three people killed there, Tymoshenko said 19 were rescued from the rubble, four of them wounded. Rescue workers searching for victims scrambled over the debris from which gray smoke billowed.An Associated Press photographer who was out shooting morning scenes of Kyiv caught one of the drones on camera, its triangle-shaped wing and pointed warhead clearly visible against the blue sky.""The whole night, and the whole morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post. ""Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine.""""The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us,"" he wrote.The Iranian-made Shaheds, which Russia has rebranded as Geran-2 drones, pack an explosive charge and can linger over targets before nosediving into them. They can be fired one after the other.Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, confirmed in a social media post that Shahed drones were among those used in the strike. Iran has previously denied providing Russia with weapons, although its Revolutionary Guard chief has boasted about providing arms to the world's top powers, without elaborating.The drones have also been repeatedly used by Russia elsewhere in Ukraine in recent weeks to target urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations. They are comparatively cheap, costing in the region of US$20,000.Their use in swarms presents a challenge to Ukrainian air defenses, said Ihnat, the Air Force spokesman. Western nations have promised to bolster Ukrainian air defenses with systems that can shoot down drones but much of that weaponry has yet to arrive and, in some cases, may be months away.""The challenges are serious because the air defense forces and means are the same as they were at the beginning of the war,"" Ihnat said. Some air defense weaponry supplied by Western nations can only be used during daylight hours when targets are visible, he added.After months during which strikes in central Kyiv were rare, early morning strikes last week put Kyiv as well as the rest of the country back on edge.Russian President Vladimir Putin said those strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Putin blames Ukraine for masterminding the blast, which suspended traffic over the bridge and curtailed Moscow's ability to supply Russian troops in the occupied regions of southern Ukraine.The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Zelenskyy said in his Sunday evening address that there was heavy fighting around the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region.The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the industrial east known as the Donbas, and were two of four regions annexed by Russia in September in defiance of international law.On Sunday, the Russian-backed regime in the Donetsk region said Ukraine had shelled its central administrative building in a direct hit. No casualties were reported."

/life-living/food-recipes/news/why-go-nuts-all-the-benefits-you-can-reap-3145041,Why go nuts: All the benefits you can reap,"Consuming nuts as part of a healthy diet may be beneficial to health. Nuts are high in unsaturated fatty acids and other nutrients. They are also great as a snack because they are cheap, easy to store, and portable. One disadvantage of nuts is that some are high in calories, so portion control is essential. However, choosing nuts over a less healthy snack may help you stick to a heart-healthy diet.Nuts are widely praised for their delicious flavour and ease of preparation, but the flavour is not the only reason they are so popular. Scientists have long lauded the health benefits of including nuts in your daily diet.There are numerous types of nuts. Raw mixed nuts typically include almonds, pistachios, cashews, walnuts, hazelnuts, etc. They are easy to find at almost any grocery store, and they are loaded with nutrients.Nuts are a nutrient-dense food that contains the majority of the vitamins and minerals the body requires. They are a major source of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), and omega-3 fatty acids that have a wide range of health benefits, from reducing rheumatoid arthritis to protecting against Alzheimer's and dementia.Nuts are mostly fats, which may seem counterintuitive for weight loss. However, the fats in nuts are almost entirely unsaturated, which means they make you feel fuller, allowing you to eat less over time. According to studies, people who eat nuts frequently have a lower risk of gaining weight than those who eat nuts infrequently.Many studies have been conducted to demonstrate the beneficial effects of nuts on heart health. Eating nuts at least four times per week is linked to a lower risk of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction.Nuts also play an important role in cholesterol regulation. Experts discovered a link between eating nuts at least a few times per week and lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the body. Lower risk of stroke or cardiovascular disease is associated with improved cholesterol.Nuts are high in vitamin E, which is a group of eight antioxidant compounds that help prevent cancer and osteoporosis.Nuts are also great sources of:Nuts are high in fibre, with almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios, and pecans among the best. A high-fibre diet has been linked to a lower risk of a variety of chronic diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Increasing your fibre intake can also help to support and regulate your digestive function.Polyphenols in nuts also help to keep our guts healthy by feeding the good bacteria that live there. They do this by fuelling the bacteria, allowing them to grow and multiply. Certain bacteria, in turn, produce short-chain fatty acids, which have numerous benefits for both our gut and our overall health.Despite being a healthy food for many people, tree nuts are one of the eight most common food allergens and can cause allergic reactions, including severe anaphylaxis. Cross-contamination is a particular concern for those who are allergic to nuts and necessitates extra caution when eating out."

Such is the case for artist Khurshid Saleem's maximalist abstractions, which are a wonderful example of geometric shapes and spontaneous flowing shades coming together.Gallery Chitrak inaugurated ""Hidden Beauty"", Khurshid Saleem's 80th solo exhibition, on October 14. Present at the event as chief guest was art critic Professor Nazrul Islam; General Secretary of Bangladesh Awami Swechasebak League, Afzalur Rahman Babu was the special guest, and Professor Nisar Hossain, Dean of Fine Arts Institute (DU) took on the role of the chairperson.In his speech, Professor Nisar mentioned how Saleem transfers practical knowledge through his artworks and that he has worked relentlessly to promote Bangladeshi artists.Khurshid Saleem is a veteran artist who has left his mark in almost all the continents. New York based art critic Ed McCormack, in reference to Saleem, had said in the past, ""If Rothko was a minimalist, Saleem is a maximalist in terms of the number of formal elements he brings into play on the canvas"".Aside from having 75 international exhibitions, Saleem's paintings have made a place for themselves in museums across Asia and Europe.Every painting currently hung on the walls of Gallery Chitrak feel like portals to another dimensions. The most prominent feature of Khurshid Saleem's artistry is the balance in 3D forms and the use of colours. There are 50 paintings in this exhibition, all part of his 'Hidden Beauty' series.When asked about his thought-process, the artist shared that he draws inspiration from nature—and the beauty that often goes unnoticed—capturing the spirit of natural beauty on his canvas, through the use of abstraction.The painting labelled 19 makes visitors travel through a tunnel to a colourful world. Smaller pieces like number 8 and 9 hold the most intricate details with ethereal shades.Number 41 is an extruded form in motion, wrapped in colours. Happiness screams through number 22 and 23, with pretty and glittery paint, whereas number 31 reminds me of an old decayed living room, like the one where Professor Slughorn was temporarily residing, in ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"".The piece that intrigued me the most was number 44, resembling the infinity fortress in the anime ""Demon Slayer"". This piece contains a dominant contrast between deep and light hues, a hierarchy in forms and depth, and a symbiotic fluidity with glittering colours.All in all, ""Hidden Beauty"" is a wonderful showcase of Khurshid Saleem's mastery. Gallery Chitrak will run this exhibition till October 22."

/sports/football/news/i-have-never-asked-leave-psg-mbappe-after-win-against-marseille-3144781,'I have never asked to leave' PSG: Mbappe after win against Marseille ,"Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe insisted Sunday he has ""never asked to leave"" the Qatar-owned club in the January transfer window despite reports that he intended to seek a transfer as soon as possible.""I am very happy. I have never asked to leave in January,"" he said after PSG's 1-0 win over Marseille, insisting that he was not ""implicated directly or indirectly"" in the rumours about his future that spread last week.Earlier Neymar scored the only goal of the game as Paris Saint-Germain maintained their unbeaten record this season and moved three points clear at the top of Ligue 1 by beating bitter rivals Marseille 1-0 on Sunday.The Brazilian converted a Kylian Mbappe assist in first-half stoppage time to decide a hard-fought encounter with chances at both ends and a red card for Marseille defender Samuel Gigot.He was sent off in the 72nd minute for scything down Neymar, whose theatrical reaction may have helped convince the referee to produce a red card instead of a yellow.It is a welcome return to winning ways for PSG after three straight draws -- two of which came against Benfica in the Champions League -- and a week overshadowed by new doubts about Mbappe's future at the club.PSG are three points clear of surprise package Lorient, who drew 0-0 on Saturday with Reims.Lens are five points behind the leaders in third, with Marseille another point adrift now in fourth after their second successive domestic defeat.Mbappe lined up for the Parisians despite the reports this week that he wants to leave the Qatar-owned club at the earliest possible opportunity.Lionel Messi returned for Christophe Galtier's side after missing the last two games with a minor injury, and the Argentine was desperately unlucky not to find the net from a first-half free-kick.After being fouled just outside the area, his dead-ball strike from a little over 20 metres hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced away off the line.Before that Mbappe was twice denied by fine saves from Marseille goalkeeper Pau Lopez, while PSG lost Danilo Pereira to injury early on.The Portugal midfielder has been standing in at centre-back with Presnel Kimpembe injured, while Sergio Ramos was suspended here.PSG will hope Pereira's injury is nothing serious, as will the player with the World Cup now just over a month away.Marseille were a threat too when they got forward but the home side went ahead two minutes into added time at the end of the half.Marco Verratti won back possession high inside the Marseille half before Mbappe set up Neymar to slot a first-time shot low into the corner for his ninth league goal of the campaign.Marseille, who beat Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League in midweek, could not find an equaliser in the second half and were handicapped by the loss of Gigot for his lunge on Neymar.- Blanc loses Lyon debut -Earlier, Lyon's alarming slump continued as they went down 3-2 to Rennes in their first game since appointing former PSG boss Laurent Blanc as their new coach.Blanc succeeded the sacked Peter Bosz last week to return to French football more than six years after his departure from Paris, where he won three Ligue 1 titles in three seasons.His only coaching job in the intervening period came at Al Rayyan in Qatar, a club he departed in February after just over a year in charge.He is now charged with reviving the fortunes of the seven-time former French champions but a brace from Martin Terrier and an Amine Gouiri goal gave Rennes the victory which leaves them fifth.Alexandre Lacazette scored twice for Lyon who are now down in 10th after seeing their run without a win extended to six games.""I enjoyed everything about my day. Everything except the result,"" said Blanc.Monaco are sixth after a 1-1 draw with Clermont in which they were hindered by the early sending-off of Malian midfielder Mohamed Camara.Breel Embolo put the principality side ahead, following up to score after his penalty was saved, but Komnen Andric equalised for Clermont."
/business/economy/news/steps-fta-japan-underway-3144651,Steps for FTA with Japan underway,"Bangladesh is working on getting either a free trade agreement (FTA) or economic partnership agreement (EPA) signed with Japan, the most promising export market in Asia, with the commerce ministry having already prepared a relevant memorandum of cooperation (MoC). ""Both Bangladesh and Japan are scheduled to sign the MoC in November this year,"" Senior Commerce Secretary Tapan Kanti Ghosh told The Daily Star over the phone yesterday.This is the first step towards signing a trade deal with Japan for retaining zero-duty benefits once Bangladesh makes the United Nations status graduation from a least developed country (LDC) to a developing one in 2026.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit Japan next month, when negotiations for an FTA may begin, Ghosh said.He said senior officials of both Bangladesh and Japan have already discussed the issue through a video conference recently.Riding on preferential trade benefits as an LDC, Bangladesh's exports to the island country in East Asia has been rising fast, especially apparel items, because of high demand.Riding on preferential trade benefits as an LDC, Bangladesh's exports to Japan, especially of apparel items, have been rising fast because of high demand 


Riding on preferential trade benefits as an LDC, Bangladesh's exports to Japan, especially of apparel items, have been rising fast because of high demand Last fiscal year it was worth $1.35 billion, a year-on-year rise of 14.40 per cent, according to data from the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). Of it, $1.10 billion was from garments.Japan is the only Asian nation where Bangladesh's export of garments crossed the $1 billion mark over the last few years.Shipment of garment items to Japan from Bangladesh started leapfrogging since April 2011, when Japan relaxed its Rules of Origin for the LDCs and for knitwear sector.Earlier, Japan did not allow zero-duty on shipment for knitwear to protect its indigenous knitwear sector.Last week, Japanese Ambassador to Bangladesh ITO Naoki said the apparel shipments were expected to rise tenfold to reach $10 billion by 2030.He, however, said Bangladesh would have to improve its investment and business climate to sign an FTA or EPA and attract more Japanese investment.Addressing an annual general meeting of the Japan Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Dhaka, he said the number of Japanese companies in Bangladesh has tripled over the last decade, reaching 338 in 2022.Most are desperate to expand their businesses and want an FTA to be signed, he said.A lot of Japanese companies have been relocating their businesses to other countries from Japan and China, pointed out Naoki.A Japanese Special Economic Zone at Araihazar at Nayaranganj will be the best in Asia in terms of facilities, infrastructures, labour industrial relations and business environment, said the ambassador.Japan is implementing some mega projects in Bangladesh, including a deep sea port in Matarbari, a metro rail in Dhaka and a third terminal at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, which are expected to be completed within the next few years, he said.According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, the nation currently has 21 operational FTAs or EPAs.They are with Singapore, Mexico, Malaysia, Chile, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), the Philippines, Switzerland, Vietnam, India, Peru, Australia, Mongolia, TPP12 (Trans-Pacific Partnership), TPP11, European Union, US, UK and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.Another three FTAs are underway with Turkey, Colombia, Japan-China-Republic of Korea, the foreign ministry also said.On the other hand, Bangladesh has just signed one preferential trade agreement with Bhutan in December 2020.Initiatives at signing a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (Cepa) with India were taken last month.Experts said Bangladesh would make much gains from the proposed FTA or EPA as Japan was a major export destination and there was no possibility of losing that much revenue from tariffs Bangladesh imposes on the import of Japanese goods.However, it was the opposite in case of China and India.The economic giants are major sources for Bangladesh's imports. Bangladesh will lose a significant amount of revenue from import tariffs if an FTA with China and Cepa with India are signed.Bangladesh imported goods worth more than $20 billion from China and earned nearly Tk 30,000 crore from import duties last fiscal year.Another Tk 20,000 crore was earned as duty from goods worth more than $16 billion imported from India. "

/life-living/health-fitness/news/tools-cultivating-happiness-yamas-and-niyamas-yoga-3145046,Tools for cultivating happiness: Yamas and Niyamas in yoga,"The purpose of yoga is to achieve liberation from suffering through the realisation of our true nature. By practicing the eight limbs of yoga, we purify our conscience so we can perceive our inner divinity. Two of these eight limbs, the yamas and niyamas, are the social and personal ethics that form the foundation of a yogic lifestyle that enables us to advance along a spiritual path towards enlightenment. These are tools for cultivating happiness and self-confidence. When you come across an obstacle, a moment that tries your patience, a person that rubs you the wrong way, think of it as an opportunity to practice using these tools. This will help you put your spirituality into action.Ahimsa
Non-violence. To cause no harm, exercise compassion. Be kind in thoughts, words and actions, to yourself and to others. Practice non-violence on the mat and off. Critical words, self-flagellation and gossip are forms of violence. A yogic lifestyle requires us to be vegetarian so we do not hurt animals. When are people violent? When they are afraid. Where there is love, there is no fear. Hence, non-violence is a form of compassion.Satya
Truth. Always speak your truth. Act according to your truth. Be authentic. No masks. You are good enough; you do not have to pretend to be someone else to fit in. Be honest with yourself. When we lie, we disconnect from our true selves. We confuse our minds, and we cannot trust ourselves. One lie leads to another, and soon, you are a prisoner in your own masquerade. Let the truth set you free.
That does not mean you should hurt someone's feelings by speaking bluntly. The highest ranking yama is ahimsa (non-violence), so we should honour the principle of non-harming first. Tell the truth in such a way that it does not cause harm. The Greek tragedian, Sophocles said, ""Truly, to tell lies is not honourable; but when the truth entails tremendous ruin, to speak dishonourably is pardonable.""Asteya
No stealing. Do not steal other people's possessions, ideas, or time. Do not take more than your share. If it is not given freely, do not take it.Brahmacharya
Be wise with your sexual energy. Sexual energy exchange should not be frivolous, but rather, the cherry on top of deep connection and intimacy. Do not use sex to control or cause pain. Practice restraint.Aparigraha
Do not be greedy. Attach to nothing, connect to everything. Always show gratitude for what you have. Take only what you need. If you receive something, give something else away. When you face change (in your job, relationships, home) consider what you try to cling to, and why. Let go of who you were to make space for who you are becoming. Trust and let go.  Shoucha
Cleanliness in body, thoughts and actions. This is the foundation for physical health and the doorway to tranquil states of meditation. It may be compared to ablutions and fasting to cleanse the body and the organs. One should also have a clean mind and an uncluttered home where energy can flow freely. Yoga offers many kriyas for cleaning the mind and body. Choose what you put into yourself: food, emotions, and thoughts. Toxins in the gut affect your liver and your brain. As the body becomes clean, you experience radiant health; as the mind becomes clean, you feel clear, relaxed and cheerful.Santosha
Contentment. This comes from acceptance of ourselves and our experiences. If you are struggling with acceptance, contemplate karma. Whatever comes your way, you have drawn to yourself. Now be content with it. Everything is perfect. With contentment comes delight, happiness, and joy. Let go of the past. Do not punish yourself for not being wiser, for making choices that now seem foolish. Trust the process. Look for the lessons in your experiences to evolve. Meditate to get distance from your present situation, to see life in a larger context. Ride the ups and downs with poise. If you are stuck in an obsessive spiral of negative thoughts and beliefs, break the cycle with yoga.If your personal narrative is full of negative beliefs, change your story. Examine when you built these beliefs and dismantle them; replace them with beliefs that serve you. Become aware of the stories you tell yourself. It is difficult to see the goodness in yourself and others if you are constantly putting yourself down. Let go of your distorted lens of self-doubt and see your own astonishing light. Then, santosha becomes possible.Tapas
Discipline. Tapas refers to the heat that comes from determined effort. The effort of the asanas, the effort of a regular practice of any sort. Sadhana. What does not challenge you, does not change you. To bring about transformation, we must be committed, regular and passionate. Practice with fervour. Take small steps and make it easy for yourself to stay committed. Remove the temptations that challenge your will power.Svadhyaya
Self-study. Know thyself. Yoga is the journey inwards. Journaling is a powerful way to understand your thought patterns and underlying belief structure. But here, self-study is about coming to the realisation that the Self is divine. Here we are talking about the Cosmic Self (purusha), that is connected to the universal Self. In yoga, the image offered is of the ocean and its waves. Each wave is an individual being, unique in location and space, but the substance of each wave is the sea itself. Similarly, the individual awareness is never separate from the infinite consciousness.Rumi says, ""I am not a drop in the ocean. I am the ocean in a drop."" As we practice, our mind evolves, and we can see this truth with clarity. Repeating 'So Hum, Hum Sa' (I am the universe, the universe is me) can help us achieve clarity. Do not take my word for it.Ishvara pranidhana
Surrender. Trustful surrender to God. This means, trust the process, trust the Source. You are connected and supported. Align yourself with your higher powers. When you meditate, transcend the limitations of your attachments and ego, and connect with the Divine. Offer up your practice as worship.These practices will guide you towards wholeness and fulfilment. To play with these ideas further, contemplate, journal and meditate on how they turn up in your life, and where there is room for improvement, make small changes to evolve.

We have stopped purchasing each and every non-essential item. I reduced buying medicines for my ailing father.""The poor people seem to get no respite from crises.Over two years of coronavirus restrictions rendered many of them unemployed while many others saw their income drastically fall.A survey by the Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC) and the Brac Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD) in April last year found that the economic shock of the pandemic pushed an estimated 2.45 crore people into poverty.Just when they began to eke out a living, the war in Ukraine started in February this year. It caused global supply chain disruptions that resulted in food inflation.Food prices have been rising for months, and in recent weeks, the prices jumped upwards. It became utterly difficult for poor people to make ends meet after the government in August raised fuel prices that had a ripple effect on transport costs and the market of daily essentials.Against this backdrop, the country today is observing the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.Inflation reached 9.52 percent, a 10-year high, in August before coming down slightly to 9.1 percent in September.Tafura Begum, a widow in Rayer Bazar slum, said she had to provide for her two children and elderly mother with just Tk 10,000 she earned a month by working as a house staff. She has to pay Tk 3,000 for rent and make do with the remaining money.""Things were a bit better only six months ago. The daily essentials are becoming unaffordable. We eat only rice and potatoes on most days because vegetables are too expensive,"" she said, adding that buying meat and fish was unimaginable for her.""I can only afford to feed eggs to my children once a week,"" she said.Abdur Rashid, who sells cucumbers by the road in Farmgate, said his family members were also changing their eating habits.""We now eat only rice and some cheap vegetables. We have stopped purchasing each and every non-essential item. I reduced buying medicines for my ailing father,"" he said.The impact of the pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war has unravelled decades of progress made in poverty eradication.Before the pandemic hit Bangladesh in early 2020, around 20 percent of the population lived below the national poverty line, marking impressive progress made since the country's independence.According to the Household Expenditure Survey 1973-74, around 82 percent of the population in the war-ravaged country lived below the poverty line.The rate fell below 50 percent by 2000, 32 percent by 2010, and 25 percent by 2016.Prof Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said the social safety measures should be expanded to support the people hit hard by the surging inflation.The poverty situation of the 70s should not be compared with the current situation because the income inequality is significantly higher now, he added.""At the moment, we don't know the exact poverty rate as there is no official survey,"" he told this newspaper."
