The tweet said: ""Look at this Mark How you gone kick me off instagram.""West then tweeted: ""You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda."" That post, in which he said he wasn't anti-Semitic, has been removed by Twitter due to a violation of its policies. His account was also locked, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.The step by Twitter Inc to lock the rapper's account was noteworthy because billionaire Elon Musk, who has said he would buy Twitter and calls himself a free speech absolutist, had welcomed West's return to the platform and replied to a post by the rapper tweeting: ""Welcome back to Twitter, my friend!""West has also previously made erratic online posts. Earlier this year, he was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours after he directed racial slurs at comedian Trevor Noah.Before he took to Twitter early on Saturday, West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, had his Instagram account suspended after a since-removed post in which he invoked anti-Semitic tropes, accusing a musician of being controlled by ""the Jewish people.""The company said on Saturday temporary restrictions on posting, commenting and messaging were imposed on West's Instagram account."

Yadav was suffering from respiratory complications, reports our New Delhi correspondent quoting sources.Mulayam's son Akhilesh Yadav who now heads SP, took to Twitter to announce his father's demise. ""My respected father and everyone's neta-ji has died,"" Akhilesh stated.According to Medanta Hospital authorities, Mulayam Yadav also had infection in the urinary tract.During a political career spanning more than half a century, Mulayam, a former wrestler, was elected a legislator for the first time in 1967 when he was 28 years old.Mulayam founded SP in 1992 and developed its network in UP and other parts of North India. His emergence on the back of caste-based politics in UP corresponds with the rise of Hindutva politics across India in late 1980s and was seen as a counter to the rise of the BJP.Mulayam powered SP to the pinnacle of Uttar Pradesh politics and became a national figure. He was UP chief minister three times, from 1989-1991, 1993-1995 and 2003-2007. From 1996 to 1998, he was also India's defence minister in the government of United Front coalition headed successively by H D Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral.It was during his tenure as UP chief minister that Mulayam Yadav had ordered police to fire on saffron activists agitating on the Ayodhya temple issue in 1990. Sixteen people were killed in the police action. The incident also led to the rise of Yadav (the core electoral base of SP) and Muslims in the political axis of UP.Mulayam was away from national political scene for the last few years due to his failing health."

/sports/cricket/news/double-joy-pakistan-new-zealand-visit-3139061,Double joy for Pakistan with New Zealand visit ,"New Zealand will tour Pakistan twice from late December, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on Monday, more than a year after abandoning a series there over security concerns.Pakistan authorities fumed after New Zealand abruptly withdrew from their first tour of the country in nearly two decades, minutes before the start of the first one-day international in Rawalpindi in September last year.Pakistan's quest to reach the ICC World Test Championship final will go up a gear when the Asia side host New Zealand for a two-match Test series at the end of the year.The Kiwis will be the third team to tour Pakistan in 2022 when they travel to South Asia in December, following successful series earlier this year against Australia and England.The Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Monday that the first Test against New Zealand will start on December 27 in Karachi, with the second and final Test in Multan from January 4.Pakistan currently sit in fifth place on the World Test Championship standings and will likely need to win the majority of their remaining five Test matches this period if they are to feature in next year's final.Babar Azam's side host England for three Tests at the start of December, before they take on Kane Williamson's team in a pair of Test matches over the New Year.New Zealand will also play three ODI in Pakistan in mid-January and return to the country in April for a total of 10 white-ball fixtures across a four-week period that are included to make-up for the abandoned tour from September last year.
PCB Director of International Cricket Zakir Khan is already looking forward to New Zealand's return to the country.""New Zealand is one of the high-performing sides and the more we will play against the top teams in our backyard, the better we will get as a unit, which is crucial to our objective of featuring inside the top-three across all formats,"" he said.""The New Zealand matches will also provide opportunities to our youngsters to continue to watch and follow their favourite players in action, something they have missed when we were forced to play our international cricket offshore.""And it's no surprise that the valuable World Test Championship points are high on the agenda for Pakistan and Zakir.""Three Tests against England followed by two Tests versus New Zealand over six weeks will give us a chance to strengthen our claims for a place in the ICC World Test Championship final,"" he said.""The eight ODIs will help us to prepare for September's Asia Cup and October's 50-over ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023. ""As such, the series against New Zealand will not only be from the top drawer but will also have context, making it something to watch out for.""

/entertainment/tv-film/news/five-bollywood-films-deal-mental-health-3139201,Mental health represented in Bollywood: Five stellar movies,"Mental health has always been heavily stigmatised within the Indian subcontinent. This is particularly the case in the mainstream media, where we often see misguided portrayals of the issue, often being showcased as 'madness' rather than a health issue.In the past, mental health has often been reduced to a sub-plot, solely for entertainment purposes. This exacerbation of pre-existing stigmas, often through 'crazy' characters—usually destined to be sent off to an asylum—is a common theme in Bollywood.With the times changing, coupled with more awareness, Bollywood filmmakers began making a serious effort to address mental health with more sympathy and knowledge. This shift was important, because films have the power to influence the general opinions of the public.Representations of mental health issues in Indian films date back to 2005, with Aparna Sen's classic ""15 Park Avenue"". This film revolves around the life of Meethi, a schizophrenic, played by Konkona Sen Sharma. It brilliantly explores the impact of the disease on her life, her family, and her relationships, and it is one of the very first films attempting to destigmatise this sensitive issue.With each layer of the story fleshing out a new perspective about the protagonist, ""15 Park Avenue"" provides specificity and a much-needed representation of someone living with schizophrenia. Sen personally regarded this to be her most 'honest' film, given that she had first-hand experiences of dealing with similar trauma. In the same year, Sanjay Leela Bhansali presented his viewers with ""Black"", a film where Debraj, Amitabh Bachchan's character, struggles with Alzheimer's disease. This film was far from the usual, aesthetically-pleasing drama we expect from the director.Bhansali drew inspiration from Hellen Keller's autobiography for the film, to put forward a compelling story about a deaf and blind girl, and her elderly tutor. While it did not deal with the details of Debraj's conditions, it provided a good sneak peek into the early symptoms of disorientation and confusion, allowing people to relate and empathise with individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease.    In 2007, Aamir Khan produced and acted in ""Taare Zameen Par"", a film that greatly helped normalise children within the autism spectrum in the Indian subcontinent. Even after 15 years of its release, it is widely appreciated and referred to for shedding light on how the education system treats children living with these conditions.""Taare Zameen Par"" was also one of the first mainstream films that incorporated mental health within the main plot, through Ishaan and his struggles with dyslexia. The movie was not only a blockbuster, but also very successful in initiating conversations about learning disorders in otherwise conservative households. It presented dyslexia from the perspective of the eight-year-old protagonist, as a real problem faced by millions of children across the world.Another remarkable film starring Alia Bhatt, ""Dear Zindagi"", greatly normalised the idea of seeking professional help through therapy, eradicating the notion that these conditions are all made up and exaggerated.Kaira, the protagonist, is seen struggling with depression and abandonment issues. The film reveals the causes behind her mental health struggles, helps her achieve clarity on them, and ends on a rather happy note. It follows her journey towards self-development, healing and love.""Dear Zindagi"" also blurred the lines between the psychiatrist and the patient, showing how their individual approaches do not need to be strict and intimidating. While this film intended to connect more with young adults, it had a little something for everyone.  Finally, another Bollywood film that explored the importance of mental health and left a lasting impression, is Nitesh Tiwari's ""Chhichhore""—which deals with anxiety. While the film features the everyday adventures of a group of university friends, it does an amazing job of reflecting the societal pressures of expectations, especially within this subcontinent.This film is a cult favourite, and has been greatly appreciated for its attempt to tackle suicide prevention through mainstream media.Films such as these have not only shed light on mental health conditions, but have also been instrumental in initiating difficult conversations, by presenting relatable characters and circumstances."

The ceremony was graced by the presence of His Excellency Achim Troster, the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany. Photographer and Principal of Counter Foto- A Center for Visual Arts, Saiful Huq Omi also attended the event as a guest. Curated by Wakilur Rahman, the exhibition started off after the valuable speeches from the guests.Kala Kendra walls are adorned with Aneek Mustafa Anwar's versatile photographic journey. Wakilur Rahman says, ""we live in a world where everything is transient- our moods, feelings, experiences. This impermanence is what makes our life so beautiful. Aneek's photography captures this very essence of beautifully fleeting moments."" Despite being an engineer, Aneek chose to pursue photography and have participated in several exhibitions, and workshops locally, and internationally. With five international awards in his bag, Aneek currently holds the position of vice-principal of Counter Foto- A Center for Visual Arts.The first room of Kala Kendra contains Aneek's collaboration with Raghu Rai in India. This series is on the colourful and vibrant Pushkar Mela in the heart of Thar desert from where glimpses of the middle east can be seen. The myriad of people and their camels, the Hindu myths and culture, the livelihoods, their daily chores, food, dances, the desert moon- every small detail had been captured in Aneek's frames.Aneek's attempt to show the importance of parks in Dhaka city inspired him to take photos of people of all ages, and eccentric statues. Before cable TV emerged, cinema halls were the most beloved places to escape reality. The photographer's birthplace is Khulna and the cinema halls there were treated as landmarks. But the modern day Cineplex have replaced old cinema halls, and this bankruptcy has resulted in their demolition. The old halls are in ruins; the staff are living in strapped condition. The once lit places with fond memories have now lost their charm to modern technology. One whole room of the gallery is dedicated for this series.In his pursuit to keep shards of his grandmother's soul, Aneek photographed her comb, shoes, jewelry etc. His three months' fellowship in Berlin provided him the opportunity to capture the ephemeral moments of the colourful, beautiful, diverse people he saw, and met there. He said that he loves to snap people, emotions, and things that are unconventional in one way or another. One photograph contains a woman in motion, dancing gracefully wearing a flowy dress. There are multiple images of lovers in every form, shape, and color. An interesting picture holds different people around a table, having different conversations in groups of two or three.The images Aneek captured through his lenses speak to us, showing a vivid world out there that exists, and invoke a desire to get out of our cocoon, and explore it. Kala Kendra will run this open-for-all exhibition till October 10, 2022.     "

Later, it came to the notice of AF Mujibur Rahman Trustee Foundation. The next year, the foundation contacted with Monghar and constructed a hostel named Rezaul Rahman Girls Hostel. The hostel was inaugurated around 3pm yesterday (October 9, 2022).At the inaugural ceremony, the children of Monghar welcomed Khushi Kabir and Nurul Islam, trustee members of AF Mujibur Rahman Trustee Foundation, with flowers, reports our Rangamati correspondent.Chakma Circle chief Raja Debashish Roy, human rights activist Nirupa Dewa, and Monghar's General Secretary Kriti Nishan Chakma were present on the occasion.Addressing the children, Khushi Kabir said, ""You all are stars, you have to spread the light in the society where the light of education has not yet reached ... You have come here through the remote mountain route. I want you to get proper education and learn to be [good] human beings. You're here with a lot of opportunities.""Appreciating the organisation's work for educating underprivileged children, trustee member Nurul Islam said that they provided support as much as they could.Monghar General Secretary Kriti Nishan Chakma highlighted the activities of the institution at the event.Monghar was first established by Buddhist monk Gyanshree in Boalkhali area under Dighinala upazila of Khagrachhari in 1961. Back then it was intended only as a Buddhist Ashram, but later with the efforts of four monks -- Bimal Tishya Mahathero, Shraddhalankar Mahathero, Priya Tisya, and Praggnananda Mahathero -- they shifted this ashram to Rangapani in Rangamati town in 1974.Currently, over 800 students are studying in this residential hostel.

/sports/football/news/ten-hag-expects-more-ronaldo-after-hitting-700th-club-goal-3138961,Ten Hag expects more from Ronaldo after hitting 700th club goal,"Erik ten Hag is hoping Cristiano Ronaldo's 700th club goal of his career can spark a return to form after the Portuguese scored the winner in Manchester United's 2-1 win at Everton on Sunday.The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has had to get used to life on the sidelines under Ten Hag after starting just once in the Premier League this season.Ronaldo was again left on the bench but was handed an early introduction by an injury to Anthony Martial.The 37-year-old took his chance just before half-time to give United a deserved three points from an error-strewn game by both sides.""Every player needs it (confidence), even when you are the best in the world,"" said Ten Hag after Ronaldo's first Premier League goal of the season.""I worked with many goalscorers and they need the goals in every season to have that feeling, that confirmation of the intuition.""Once they have some goals, they come in a flow and games go easier. That will happen with him as well.""The Red Devils were seeking a response to being thrashed 6-3 by Manchester City last weekend but got off to the worst possible start.On his first Premier League start since arriving for £60 million ($67 million) from Real Madrid, Casemiro was culpable for the opening goal as he was robbed in possession by Amadou Onana and the ball eventually broke for Alex Iwobi to curl into the top corner from outside the box.Everton came into the game with the best defensive record in the league, but were quickly undone as United levelled within 10 minutes.Antony became the first United player to score in his first three Premier League games with a cool finish from Martial's pass.Martial only lasted half an hour after pulling up with a hip injury in the warm-up.His departure paved the way for Ronaldo to make his entrance and he took just 14 minutes to make his mark.Casemiro made amends for his earlier error by winning possession in midfield and playing in his former Real Madrid teammate to fire low under Jordan Pickford.That strike took Ronaldo's tally in two spells with United to 144.Madrid's record goalscorer hit 450 for the Spanish giants, while he scored 101 times for Juventus and five for Sporting Lisbon.""He's one of the greatest players to have graced the game,"" said Everton boss Frank Lampard.

Bangladesh election campaigns are often accompanied by violence, but the authorities have failed to properly investigate and prosecute members and supporters of the ruling Awami League, who have targeted opposition public meetings and assaulted participants,"" it said.""Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly said that Bangladesh is a mature democracy capable of conducting elections and a peaceful transition of power, but instead previous polls have been marked by violence, attacks on the opposition, and voter intimidation,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""These recent cases of political attacks and arrests set an ominous tone for the upcoming parliamentary elections.""At least four people have reportedly died and hundreds have been injured in clashes between police, supporters of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), and Awami League supporters, since August 22, 2022, when the BNP staged a series of protests over fuel and commodity price increases, the report claimed.According to BNP leaders, at least 20,000 cases have been filed against its supporters, in many cases with the accused unnamed. The use of criminal complaints against large numbers of ""unknown"" people is a common abusive practice in Bangladesh, allowing the police to intimidate and threaten virtually anyone with arrest, to repeatedly re-arrest detainees even though they are not the named accused in the cases, and to thwart bail requests, the report said.HRW said law enforcement officers have used these open cases as warrants to raid the homes of political opposition members in what appears to be overt political harassment and intimidation.""Bangladesh law enforcement are under increased scrutiny following US human rights sanctions and with parliamentary elections on the horizon,"" Ganguly said. ""Diplomats in Bangladesh should raise concerns publicly and privately that such repression threatens the conditions for a free and fair election."""

The first winner was selected in 1969.Last year, half of the award went to David Card for his research on how the minimum wage, immigration and education affect the labor market. The other half was shared by Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens for proposing how to study issues that don't easily fit traditional scientific methods.A week of Nobel Prize announcements kicked off October 3 with Swedish scientist Svante Paabo receiving the award in medicine for unlocking secrets of Neanderthal DNA that provided key insights into our immune system.Three scientists jointly won the prize in physics Tuesday. Frenchman Alain Aspect, American John F Clauser and Austrian Anton Zeilinger had shown that tiny particles can retain a connection with each other even when separated, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement, that can be used for specialized computing and to encrypt information.The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded Wednesday to Americans Carolyn R. Bertozzi and K. Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal for developing a way of ""snapping molecules together"" that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs that can target diseases such as cancer more precisely.French author Annie Ernaux won this year's Nobel Prize in literature Thursday. The panel commended her for blending fiction and autobiography in books that fearlessly mine her experiences as a working-class woman to explore life in France since the 1940s.The Nobel Peace Prize went to jailed Belarus human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, the Russian group Memorial and the Ukrainian organization Center for Civil Liberties on Friday."

I'm super-pumped and motivated to end the season as well as I have done these past couple of weeks,"" said the former world number one.Djokovic now has four titles from just 10 events this season following victories in Rome and at Wimbledon.His win in the Italian capital in May gave him a 38th Masters; his Wimbledon triumph in July then equalled Pete Sampras's mark of seven at the All England Club and took him to 21 Grand Slams.Only Rafael Nadal, with 22, has more men's majors.All this in a year which saw him booted out of Melbourne and banned from travelling to North America over his continued refusal to be vaccinated.With the exception of the Laver Cup in London, which doubled up as Roger Federer's farewell, Djokovic didn't play for the best part of three months after Wimbledon.His ""restart"" in Israel came 16 years after he last played in the country.Djokovic's determination not to waver over his vaccination stance meant he missed two of the year's four Slams, at the Australian and US Opens, and four of eight Masters in Indian Wells, Miami, Montreal and Cincinnati.However, his win in Kazakhstan on Sunday allowed him to book a place in the ATP Finals for a 15th time -- only Federer (18) and Jimmy Connors and Nadal (16 each) have reached the season-ending showpiece on more occasions.When the event takes place in Turin in November, the Serb will attempt to draw level with Federer as a six-time winner having been crowned champion in 2008 and every year from 2012-15.Before then, Djokovic, the only man to have won all Masters titles twice, will defend his Paris Masters crown.""I'm just very grateful and blessed to be able to play this well at this stage of my life,"" Djokovic said on Sunday. ""You know, 35 is not 25.""When his roller-coaster year ends, Djokovic will hope he'll be able to fly to Melbourne and claim a 10th Australian Open despite the cancellation of his visa in January triggering a three-year ban on returning.The signs are encouraging.""We are on the right track to win back all the top players,"" Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley told The Australian newspaper last week.""We are in a different time than nine months ago and I think the environment has completely changed.

/life-living/health-fitness/news/puberty-boys-often-overlooked-part-growing-3139081,Puberty in boys: An often-overlooked part of growing up,"There is much on the Internet regarding puberty and its effects on girls. Not enough has been said about its effects on boys, however, even though it is just as hard becoming an adult male. For those raising boys, especially, this can be a truly daunting time as puberty catches them off guard and a parent is never fully prepared to see the changes that transform their innocent, often needy little boy into a sullen, outspoken teen.
When a boy starts going through puberty, he is bound to feel intimidated. This might cause them to retreat deeper into their shells — an action that feels deceptively exclusive to parents. Many feel shut out by their sons and countless others feel deeply hated. At this point, it is worth remembering that our boys are not deliberately trying to hurt us. They are simply scared little men trying to come to terms with the wildly unrestrained hormonal changes happening to them.Instead of taking things personally, it is infinitely prudent to give them the privacy they so desperately crave during this time. This would also mean accepting the longer bathroom and shower times, and locked bedrooms, without being verbal and understanding that some things should simply be ignored. Respecting their need to deal with certain things alone instead of hovering or nagging will help them trust you and open up to you faster.It is often during these times that a parent finds themselves having to hold the trickiest conversations like erections — that can be triggered without a moment's notice — or the dreaded conversation about the birds and bees. Before initiating these conversations, make sure your tween or teen is in one of his better moods, as they tend to vacillate between both extremes fairly quickly. Make sure these important conversations are not scheduled around fresh disagreements. It is easy to get provoked by their behaviours during this phase but picking your battles sensibly can be the best thing to do at this point. It has been proven that in places where tweens and teens do not have to make eye contact, they open up better. Car rides are good places to have uninterrupted, grown-up conversations.While trying to hold on to some semblance of their childhood, it is important to recognise the changes that make a man. Deal with the stink, the hunger pangs, and the weight gains sensitively, and try not to get teary-eyed when you hear a deeper voice instead of their usual, childish shrill.Hormones may hit them hard but it often seems as if the sheer force of those changes hits the parents infinitely harder. Therefore, while allowing them their privacy, it is important to reassure yourself that your son still needs you, even if it is not in the ways you have been used to until now. It may not seem like it right then but they do come back, and in a way that is more special than ever."

/life-living/health-fitness/news/inside-the-mind-person-suffering-ocd-3139091,Inside the mind of a person suffering from OCD,"I was diagnosed as having obsessive-compulsive behaviour (OCD) when I was 22 years old, but I have had OCD all my life. Looking back, it was so obvious, yet how I never got diagnosed earlier is beyond me. Better late than never; at least now I know why I am 'compelled' to do the things that I do.Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours. About 2 per cent of the world's population suffer from OCD and people with OCD are prone to other mental health conditions.The term OCD is thrown around way too often and to my utter annoyance, not appropriately. Obsessive compulsion — sounds pretty simple and not at all harmful, and should be easy to get rid of, right? Wrong! Not only is OCD a serious condition but it also affects every part of a person's life.Symptoms of OCD present differently for different people, but chances are you know someone who shows similar symptoms. One of the most common symptoms of OCD is that the person is very picky about everything; they like to obsessively wash or keep things tidy in their 'own' way. In our society, we make fun of people like this by using words such as — 'suchibai.' I was lucky enough that I did not grow up with that particular tag of 'suchibai,' but I had a different name. ""He turns up his nose,"" people would say. Or as the common phrase goes — ""naak ucha.""It hurt but not as much as having to get on public transport. Things got much worse when I started university and started living in the dormitory.As a person suffering from OCD, I used to keep my belongings in a particular order when I was at home. But at the dorm, I would arrange my belongings and someone else would touch them and leave them out of order. I know this sounds like a minor issue but for people like us — it's as painful as getting your fingers stuck in the drawer.The university dorm was the most intense challenge I had faced in my life. The roommates would not tidy their beds or clean the room regularly. This bugged me to the point of physical pain. It was physical pain without any physical injury — pretty much psychosis and a fate I would not wish on anyone.I had to share a bed with another person. Initially, I thought I would be able to manage and survive but I did not know this would be the trigger that would force me to go see a psychiatrist. I could not bear the touch of another person. But my bed mate at the dorm had the habit of throwing himself all across the bed. Every touch felt like a hot poker straight in my brain. I could not sleep. I tried to sleep during the day when nobody was around. The schedule did not work out.For three months, I did not sleep more than a few hours. It got so bad that I started thinking of ways to hurt myself. Everything felt like a cage and I wanted to be free. And thanks to my OCD, I started thinking about it obsessively. Pretty soon, it was compulsive enough to keep me zoned out from reality.This is when I realised, I needed help. I turned to one of my professors who happened to be our student counsellor. She listened to my issues and set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. I went there with a friend who sat with me through the whole ordeal. (And if you are going through something similar, I hope you have a friend as I did). After listening to everything I had to say, the psychiatrist made the diagnosis — ""You have OCD.""And now it all made sense. Now I know why I am compelled to wash my clothes three times before wearing them. I know why I can only knock in even numbers. I know why I have to lock and unlock my doors twice before leaving for work. I know why I have to shower three to five times a day. I know why I cannot hug another person easily. I know why I get violent flashes of images in my mind every time I walk down the street. It's because I am compelled to obsess.I know there are many more out there suffering from the same condition and I know that a large number of them are not diagnosed. Most of them are laughed at and given nicknames like — suchibai and who knows what else.Whether your condition is mild or severe, OCD is manageable and things can be easier with proper treatment. Be it with cognitive behavioural therapy or medication. Do not self-diagnose! Consult a psychiatrist or psychologist. And most importantly, be strong.Obsess about being strong. This is how we will get through it. "

/life-living/health-fitness/news/brave-new-world-how-the-urban-youth-are-tackling-mental-health-3139101,A Brave New World: How the urban youth are tackling mental health ,"When addressing mental health in Bangladesh, we're no strangers to being labelled 'mad' or in the Bengali definition 'pagol,' when we acknowledge our depression or want to invest in therapy. Among the mentally ill, the youth form a significant number. While many suffer needlessly, others actively seek assistance to tackle their mental health issues and overcome them.   According to Dr Tayabur Rahman, MBBS (Dhaka Medical College), BCS (Health), MD (Psychiatry) BSMMU, Psychiatrist, National Institute of Mental Health and Hospital (NIMH), ""Mental illnesses stem from genetics, upbringing, schooling, parental authority, family dynamics and crises. It is further perpetuated by the decrease in social gatherings, internet, pornography, gaming addiction, and anxiety disorders, which in turn affect our mental health.""The expert observes that the stigma is present more among urban populations and is only treated when a condition becomes more serious. During the COVID-19 crisis, Dr Tayabur saw a rise in estrangement between parents and their adult children.  To further understand how the youth deal with depression and other mental health conditions, we learned from young people how they cope with their mental and emotional processes during such trying times.For Joshua Edwards, 29, fitness was a priority; but when lockdowns were enforced, he was not doing well mentally.""I usually exercise at the gym to keep my mind refreshed. But after we went into lockdown, everything was closed and I could not even get a job at that point. So, constantly being at home was mentally exhausting for me. It was also getting difficult as there would be disagreements with family as a result of everyone being equally frustrated from being stuck at home"".Due to a lack of alternatives, he would go for a jog to relieve the pressure from his mind.""Although I desperately felt like getting therapy, I didn't know where to go. My sister asked me to book a therapy session with a mental health organisation once, but on the first consultation they accused me of being a substance user, which discouraged me from seeking help in the first place.""Although his parents are aware of his issues, they would usually advise him to turn to faith to feel better. ""Given the generation gap between our generation and our parent's time, I don't think they understand the need for seeking therapy the way we do, given that we have these conditions and want to sort them out.""Moe's, 28, mental health took a turn, especially when she felt concerned about her safety.""Women are conditioned to be responsible for their safety. This can heighten anxiety when there is an added layer of concern for one's safety.""To keep her fears at bay and sanity in check, Moe scheduled video calls with her parents and friends. She also recalls times when she could not feel anything.""I felt very numb to happiness or sorrow. It was not because something bad was happening; rather the monotony of the pandemic was sinking in,"" she said. In addition to that, she also had trouble sleeping due to staying indoors for long hours.  On the side of physical exhaustion, excess screen time strained her vision as well. These, followed by a lack of motivation made her wonder if her life and youth were going to remain stagnant like this in Bangladesh.She shares, ""After seeking therapy, I have understood why I feel this way and can destigmatise it now. Connecting with people also helped me internalise that much of what's on social media is not real. I can accept it now and because of this, I feel way more grateful for the things I have. I don't take it for granted anymore that I can get out of the house and socialise with people.""  As a homemaker, Maisha Mazher Khan, 33, addresses the need for mental health, especially when she's raising toddlers and infant boys. Even when past experiences with therapy discouraged her to seek mental health services, she does however feel it is essential to get the help, irrespective of social taboos.The pandemic did not impact Maisha as much because her family was close to her, but she did feel that there were certain hindrances in giving her children a normal life.""We were home all the time and there was not enough scope for them to play or go out. They were always watching TV which negatively impacted their health too,"" she said. From the looks of it, the mental health landscape is slowly but surely changing since social and medical initiatives are being taken to raise awareness. Although affordability remains a major concern among the youth, Dr Tayabur shares that government hospitals like NIMH, allow patients to consult with a mental health specialist by buying a ticket for Tk 10 only.""I have also provided outdoor services myself and some of my junior colleagues are doing the same. They are not any different from the corporate services which are priced between Tk 2000-5000.""Furthermore, hospitals like BSMMU and Dhaka Medical College's psychiatry department are also open for consultations. Apart from hospitals, there are some online platforms such as Psycure Organization, Telepsychiatry Research and Innovation Network (TRIN), Moner Bondhu, and others accessible for services on Facebook, which are also reasonably priced.""We are going through a continuous process and hopefully in a few years we will see some positive changes,"" concludes the expert.  "

This is an act of terrorism aimed at destroying critically important civilian infrastructure,"" Putin said on Sunday in a video on the Kremlin's Telegram channel.""This was devised, carried out and ordered by the Ukrainian special services.""Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said ahead of Monday's meeting that Russia should kill the ""terrorists"" responsible for the attack.""Russia can only respond to this crime by directly killing terrorists, as is the custom elsewhere in the world. This is what Russian citizens expect,"" he was quoted as saying by state news agency Tass.A blast on Saturday on the bridge over the Kerch Strait, a major supply route for Moscow's forces in southern Ukraine, prompted gleeful messages from Ukrainian officials but no claim of responsibility.The bridge is also a vital artery for the port of Sevastopol, where the Russian Black Sea fleet is based, as well as an imposing symbol of Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula.The damage to the bridge came amid battlefield defeats for Russia and growing concerns that Moscow could resort to nuclear weapons, after Putin repeatedly cautioned the West that any attack on Russia could provoke a nuclear response.Putin on Sunday met Alexander Bastrykin, the head of Russia's Investigative Committee, who presented findings of an inquiry into what he said was the explosion of a vehicle and subsequent fire on the bridge.Bastrykin said the vehicle had travelled through Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, North Ossetia and Russia's Krasnodar region before reaching the bridge. Among those who helped Ukrainian special services prepare were ""citizens of Russia and foreign countries,"" Bastrykin added in the video on the Kremlin's Telegram channel.Oleksandr Kovalenko, a military analyst and head of the website Information Resistance, told Espreso TV website, a digital broadcaster well-known in Ukraine, that Russia may intensify attacks on civilian targets after the explosion on the Crimea bridge.""This probably means missile attacks on border areas - Sumy and Chernihiv regions. It could also mean using missiles and (Iranian-made) Shahed-136 drones to hit even deeper into Ukrainian territory,"" he said.Images showed part of the bridge's roadway blown away, although rail services and partial road traffic resumed.The Russian transport ministry, quoted by RIA news agency, said nearly 1,500 people and 162 heavy cargoes had travelled by ferry across the Kerch Strait since the explosion.Putin opened the 19-km (12-mile) bridge linking Crimea to Russia with great fanfare in 2018.Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday its forces in southern Ukraine could be ""fully supplied"" through existing land and sea routes."

This short film is a part of season 3 of the ""Bite Size Halloween"" horror-anthological series, covering social issues through a variety of genres.The short film begins with shots from a Bangladeshi tannery, the manager of which is looking for a rental apartment. Despite having money and fulfilling the other acceptable criterion, he is denied by most tenants, as many them are looking for foreign renters.""Foreigners Only"" proceeds to highlight the concepts around race, in formerly colonised countries like ours. One is forced to take a step back and ponder about the helplessness when revolting against such subtle, yet impactful racism.With a blend of brilliant cinematographic skill and artistic storytelling, the short film shows how natural and circumstantial, and thus insignificant, skin is. But the social significance of skin colour is aptly shown in the film.The film is able to show the duality and inequality that defines Dhaka. It hints at the influence of the media in shaping our mindsets. The scenes showing advertisements of skin lightening products portray the colourism that centres our concepts of beauty. However, the grim cinematography, which highlights the elements of gore in the film, has to be its most gripping part.So believable and raw is the cinematography, that one feels disgusted seeing the scenes involving the tannery and the main character's skin disease. Yet, the gripping storyline engages the audience so much, that one can't help but want to find out what happens next. The suspense built around the drama climaxes with a brilliant ending, challenging our notions around the concept of value judgement.We witnessed colonisation firsthand. Our wealth has been looted, our dignity tarnished. Nuhash Humayun reminds us of this particular part of our history, and tells us once again that our fascination with white foreigners and the supposed moral and intellectual superiority they possess is extremely unfortunate.If you're still debating whether you want to watch this particular short-film, then I would highly recommend you give this, and the rest of the season, a watch."

The sixth over saw four wickets fall and the equation was reduced to a challenging 12 off the last over but the home side batters were not able to strike a single boundary. Player-of-the-match Inoka Ranaweera grabbed four wickets in two overs while conceding only seven runs. Earlier, Sri Lanka were sent in to bat first and the island nation scored 83 for five in 18.1 after a 30-min rain stopped proceedings, which meant DLS method had to be introduced to give the home side a reduced target.Nilakshi de Silva top-scored for Sri Lanka with an unbeaten 31-ball 28. For Bangladesh, Rumana Ahmed was the pick of the bowlers for Bangladesh with two scalps for 14 runs in three overs. The defending champions now find themselves in a tricky situation to reach the semifinals of the regional event.

/star-literature/news/journey-local-bus-3138966,A Journey by Local Bus,"In the year 2018, I was a third-year university student at the Military Institute of Science and Technology and my residence was in Dhaka Cantonment. The distance between my house and my alma mater is only nine kilometers. Most of the days I used to travel by the university bus. If somehow, I missed it, only then I would take a local bus. Entering a local bus is similar to entering a mine field, except for stepping on a mine, you might end up stepping on the foot of a sweaty angry passenger inside a jam-packed bus. Dhaka is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and you will be rightly aware of this fact after entering a local bus during rush hour. Your ride will be the most enjoyable if it is summer or monsoon. All the local buses of Dhaka city are possessed by an angry, selfish spirit, I bet. And as soon as any passenger enters a bus, they are also immediately possessed by that obnoxious spirit. They become mean and nasty, they stop thinking about the fellow travelers' comfort or wellbeing; a pure ""survival of the fittest"" scenario. These are fiercely competitive passengers, who can even kill others to avail a transport.            At that time, there was no pandemic, nobody wore masks and no seats were needed to be left blank for health safety. In fact, if you could catch a bus within time amidst the cacophonous crowd, that was your lucky day. And if you could get an empty seat for the commute, well, then that was a miraculous happening.            It was a weekday and I missed my university bus. With a sullen face I stood in the queue to catch any local bus arriving at the nearest bus stop. After waiting for fifteen to twenty minutes I could finally get into a 52 seat non-AC bus, that too with an empty 52nd seat right at the back. ""What a lucky day; what a divine conspiracy,"" I thought. In the back row there were a total of six seats. After much hurdle, I reached the empty seat which was situated in the middle of five men of various ages and classes. I took a deep breath and decided to fill up the blank seat. It did feel uncomfortable, but I thought, ""That's life. Now don't keep analyzing lest you'll lose this seat!""            As I was just going to sit, the guy sitting by the left window stood up. He requested the other four guys to scooch to the right so that I could sit by the left window and be saved from the awkwardness. He surely was a gentleman whom the evil spirit of local bus did not possess yet. My thoughts shifted and I started focusing on this young man. He was tall and lean with wide shoulders, a clean shaved elongated face, sparkling authoritative eyes and very manly features. He had a strict middle-class air to him. He was wearing a pair of casual jeans and a not very classy semi-formal shirt, and I guessed he was in his mid to late 20s. I felt in my stomach a tingling sensation, my heart fluttered. ""This could be my Knight in shining armor!"" I thought. I felt as if I were starring as the lead heroine in a romantic Bollywood movie opposite this virtuous hero. Everything felt like a stupendous coincidence, as if stars were being aligned. The smell of stale sweat transformed into a sweet fragrance, the cacophony gave birth to a rhythmic melody, and the unpleasant disposition turned into a romantic scene. He made room for me and I sat by the left window. He sat right next to me. The bus kept moving towards the destination. It became a dreamy ride.           The seats were congested, I struggled to carry the backpack on my lap. The gentleman sitting next offered to carry my backpack on his lap. I asked him not to, but he took it anyway saying, ""You are a tall person like me, I understand your pain. It is tough for people like us to journey in these congested local buses. Please let me hold your backpack. Sit comfortably, it's at least a 20 minutes journey."" I was smitten and let him do what he wished for. ""So, are you a student of MIST?"" he asked. I nodded in the affirmative. It's not a difficult task to identify a student of MIST. Thanks to our grey and white kindergarten style uniform. However, the uniform didn't embarrass me that day. He guessed, ""You are not used to traveling by local bus, are you?"" ""Not that much,"" I nodded shyly. We exchanged smiles. I didn't wish to talk to him anymore. All I wanted to do was to pretend looking outside the window while imagining a lifetime with this hero. I wondered what it would be like to spend the rest of my life with him. I imagined us living in a small apartment at the outskirts of Dhaka, with jobs paying us only bare minimum, a happy life where there were no diseases or miseries, just him and me, and our happily ever after. We actually didn't talk to each other. Probably, he was imagining something else. Maybe he already had a loving wife at home and an ailing mother whose gall bladder needed to be operated as soon as possible. Maybe he was on the same route as I, to lend money from an old friend who happened to live in Mirpur DOHS. ""Nope!"" I didn't like that idea. So, I planned to ask him his name and learn who he really was. Sadly, I had already reached my bus stop by then and we never got know each other's name. He handed me the backpack, ""Here you go."" I replied with a smile, ""Thank you very much for your kind help."" He acknowledged, ""I am very glad that I could be of any help!"" I got down from the bus and we never ever met again. It has been 4 years since that encounter. I don't travel by that route anymore and fortunately I don't have to journey by local buses anymore. I don't even remember his face. But his kind gesture remains fresh in my memory even today. Maliha Huq is an engineer who loves reading books and (sometimes) enjoys writing essays and fiction.

The cases were related to violence and assault.However, a press release sent by Rab-15 late last night said that, Nurul is accused in two cases from 2015 under the anti-terrorism act filed with Chattagram's Banshkhali and Hathazari police stations.The statement claimed that, as a terrorist he used to radicalise youth, and run a training centre in Banshkhali.He was seeking to reorganise youth for a terrorist outfit called the Amir Hamza Brigade, claimed the statement.The statement said that he had previously been arrested in 2009 in Bandarban's Naikhyangchhari and spent a month in jail."

Our former player Ali Daei is no longer permitted to leave the country because he has come out in favour of women's rights.""In remarks to the sports website Varzesh3 on Sunday, Daei's brother Mohammad said: ""Ali has given his whole life to raise the flag of Iran, he loves the country and its people and always speaks the truth.""What happened to Ali is regrettable.""A number of Iranian sportsmen as well as actors and filmmakers have thrown their weight behind the demonstrations, asking authorities to listen to the people's demands.On Thursday, local media reported that former Bayern Munich midfielder Ali Karimi was facing prosecution over his support for the protests.The authorities have also seized the passports of singer Homayoun Shajarian and his wife, actress Sahar Dolatshahi, as well as that of filmmaker Mehran Modiri, the ILNA news agency reported Sunday.On September 30, Iranian authorities arrested former football player Hossein Mahini over his support for the protests, accusing him of ""encouraging riots"". He was reportedly released on bail early last week.

There would ultimately be a unique identity (against each national),"" Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam said while briefing reporters after the meeting.The birth registration number of a person will be used in his/her passport, NID and other documents, he said.He said now the decision has been taken to bring the NID registration under the supervision of the government as the original concept (of the EC), which was floated in December 1996, was the preparation of voter cards not NID cards. ""The basic concept was related to elections,"" he added.The Election Commission currently conducts the national identity registration operation and issues the national identity cards against citizens aged 18 or above, since 2007, as per the National Identity Registration Act, 2010.The Cabinet Secretary said the Security Services Division placed the draft law at the cabinet.""It (the draft law) has been approved in principle. But the condition is that the Legislative Division will consult with all the concerned,"" he said.He said the Legislative Division was asked to review the draft law on the basis of the existing law as much as possible and bring it against adding just a few clauses if needed. "
/sports/football/news/nervy-barca-cling-beat-celta-and-top-la-liga-3138976,Nervy Barca cling on to beat Celta and top La Liga,"Pedri's goal helped Barcelona earn an agonising 1-0 win over Celta Vigo to move back top of La Liga on Sunday.After Real Madrid beat Getafe, Barcelona knew they had to beat the Galicians to head into next Sunday's Clasico as league leaders, but Celta did not make it easy for them.With Barcelona clutching a narrow advantage, the visitors came close to an equaliser at Camp Nou and Marc-Andre ter Stegen earned a sixth consecutive domestic clean sheet with a brilliant save from Iago Aspas late on.Goncalo Paciencia hit the post in stoppage time with the Catalans on the ropes, begging for the whistle.""We had a great second half, with four, or five, or six clear chances, but if you don't score at Camp Nou then it's normal that you lose,"" Aspas told DAZN. ""They ended up wasting time on throw-ins.""Barca coach Xavi Hernandez started left-back Marcos Alonso in central defence, alongside Gerard Pique, partly due to injury problems, but otherwise picked his strongest side available.""UEFA is a mafia,"" chanted a sector of Barcelona fans, after president Joan Laporta advocated for the Super League again at the club members' annual general meeting on Sunday morning, but their focus soon snapped back to the game.Barcelona missed a slew of early chances, with Ferran Torres unable to reach a tempting cross and having another effort saved by Agustin Marchesin, while the goalkeeper also did well to claw out a rasping drive from Raphinha.The pressure soon told and Pedri sent Barcelona ahead in the 17th minute, with Celta defender Unai Nunez accidentally teeing up the Spanish midfielder when he tried to cut out Gavi's cross.Jordi Alba blasted into the side netting and Pedri delighted fans with a burst forward from midfield, as Barcelona continued to dominate.However Celta started the second half in determined fashion.Marcos Alonso made a fine block to deny Oscar Rodriguez from close range as the visitors pushed for the equaliser.Missed opportunities Xavi responded with a triple change, hooking wingers Torres and Raphinha, as well as resting Pedri for the crucial visit of Inter Milan on Wednesday in the Champions League.On came Ousmane Dembele, Ansu Fati and Frenkie de Jong, the latter back after injury, but it was still Celta who forged the better openings.Jorgen Larsen headed home but the goal was disallowed for offside in the build-up against Javi Galan. Ter Stegen made a stunning save to deny Aspas with six minutes remaining from 10 yards out, and Hugo Mallo flashed another effort wide.Celta substitute Paciencia hit the post from inside the box and former Barca youth player Carles Perez had a shot blocked by a sprawling Barcelona defender.Xavi's side clung on for the points, making it seven wins on the spin in La Liga, this one coming far harder than the rest.""We suffered a bit more at the end but in the end, the important thing was to get the three points,"" Alonso told DAZN.""We have to improve, we can't concede so many chances in a game that was more or less under control.""Elsewhere Brais Mendez continued his brilliant goalscoring form to earn Real Sociedad a 1-0 win over Villarreal and send the Basque side sixth in La Liga.The winger now has five goals in six matches in Spain's top flight, with his well-taken 32nd-minute strike securing a deserved triumph for Imanol Alguacil's team.Real Betis, fifth, drew 0-0 at Real Valladolid. German Pezzella was dismissed in the 35th minute, giving them an uphill challenge in the second half –- just as Luiz Felipe was in the 20th last weekend when they lost 1-0 at Celta Vigo.Joselu scored twice for Espanyol in a 2-2 draw at Cadiz, with the point taking the Catalan side 17th and dragging Sevilla down to 18th."
/opinion/project-syndicate/news/liz-truss-vs-the-bank-england-3137911,Liz Truss vs the Bank of England,"Following a week of financial market turbulence, UK Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced to scrap her plan to abolish the 45 percent top income tax rate for high earners. This U-turn, an attempt to counter a stunning market sell-off that caused the pound to crash and saw the Bank of England launch a massive bond-buying programme to prevent ""material risk to UK financial stability,"" is a necessary first step toward stabilising the economy. But unless Truss reverses more of the tax cuts or introduces policies to protect pensioners and help struggling mortgage borrowers, the market turmoil will not end soon. In fact, it could get worse.The ""mini budget"" that Truss and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng proposed at the end of last month, which includes sweeping tax cuts for corporations and the rich, would likely cause an economy-wide surge in demand, further overheating the UK economy and pushing up the already high inflation rate. The prices of British gilts fell during the week of September 23-27, as investors expected the Bank of England to offset inflationary pressures by raising interest rates faster than it had planned.But instead of selling bonds, the Bank of England began buying gilts to push down the interest rate. What explains this manoeuvre? Government bonds are a key part of many pension fund portfolios, and in recent years, many UK pension funds used the so-called liability-driven investment strategies to hedge against risks. As yields on the UK government bonds soared, pension funds struggled to meet collateral requests. The Bank of England's attempt to stabilise the price of long-term bonds was thus meant to prevent the fallout in the pensions sector from spilling over and causing a full-blown financial meltdown.But the Bank of England most likely has another motive for intervening in the government bond market. Unlike the US housing market, where 15-30-year fixed-rate mortgages are common, many UK homeowners have floating-rate mortgages. About one-third of the country's mortgages are on fixed rates that will expire in the coming two years. This means that any interest rate increase would raise the monthly mortgage payments for many British homeowners immediately or very soon. It would also make mortgages less affordable, driving many prospective home buyers to put off buying a house. So, the Bank of England's intervention may have prevented a mortgage market meltdown and a housing market crisis at the same time.But it will also boost inflation. US President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in the early 1980s – an inspiration for Truss and Kwarteng's programme – generated upward pressure on prices, but the effect on inflation was offset by the Federal Reserve's decision to sell US Treasuries rather than buy them. The Bank of England's bond-buying programme, on the other hand, will add fuel to the inflationary fire.Given the Bank of England's inflation-fighting mandate, it is reasonable to expect that it would look for ways to undo or at least mitigate the impact of its intervention. But monetary policymakers are stuck between a rock and a hard place. They can either raise the interest rate to fight inflation – thereby tolerating falling bond prices and risking mortgage troubles – or lower the interest rate to bail out mortgage borrowers and bond investors, and accept rising inflation.Truss can and must help the Bank of England find a way out of this conundrum. Given that she has demonstrated a willingness to increase government borrowing to pay for a two-year cap on household energy payments, she could also introduce a two-year cap on household mortgage payments and add protections for pensioners.To be sure, price caps are not the most effective way to deal with either skyrocketing energy bills or higher mortgage payments. But if the government is willing to cap households' energy payments, it might as well cap mortgage payments, too, since both have the same ""popularist"" logic. Yes, doing so would increase the deficit, but it would also allow the Bank of England to focus on fighting inflation without worrying too much about the pension and mortgage crises.The best way the government can stabilise the UK economy and fight inflation, however, is to reverse more of the planned tax cuts, replace the energy price cap with a fixed subsidy per household, and implement most of the spending cuts it announced.The UK's corporate and personal income tax rates were among the lowest in the OECD even before Truss and Kwarteng's budget plan, so it is hard to make the case that substantial tax cuts are required to make the UK more competitive. Moreover, providing a fixed energy subsidy instead of an energy cap would require a smaller government expenditure to provide the same amount of help to lower-income households, provide an incentive to save energy, and reduce the overall cost of energy price relief.The combination of spending cuts and reversal of some of the announced tax cuts would have an inflation-reducing effect akin to an interest rate increase. That would make it easier for the Bank of England to tame inflation with a smaller increase in the interest rate. And by facilitating the task of lowering inflation, the UK government could also make the pound more attractive to currency traders, potentially reversing some of sterling's recent declines. Shang-Jin Wei, a former chief economist at the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is a professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School and Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.
