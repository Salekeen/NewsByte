BSF personnel from Dubli camp in India's Basirhat sub-division, opposite to the Kaliani border, fired at him. Later, someone brought him to Bangladesh territory and admitted to Satkhira Sadar Hospital around 6:30am.""Satkhira-33 BGB commander Lt Col Mohammad Al Mahmud said, ""When the BSF was asked about Hasan's death, they denied the firing. However, a letter for a flag meeting was sent at the battalion level.""In Chuadanga, the body of a Bangladeshi man was seen lying on the Indian side of the border.

/sports/football/news/militao-takes-real-top-la-liga-atletico-scrape-win-3138676,"Militao takes Real top of La Liga, Atletico scrape win","Eder Militao's early goal earned Real Madrid a comfortable 1-0 win over Getafe on Saturday to take them top of La Liga.Carlo Ancelotti's side now lead Barcelona by three points, ahead of Celta Vigo's visit to Camp Nou on Sunday.Elsewhere Angel Correa's brace gave Atletico Madrid a 2-1 win over Girona, while new Sevilla coach Jorge Sampaoli earned a creditable 1-1 draw against third-place Athletic Bilbao.Real Madrid were able to secure their first clean sheet of the season in La Liga at the Coliseum and it helped them take home the three points.""It's clear that we want to score more than one, two, or three, but keeping the clean sheet here gave us the win,"" said defender Dani Carvajal.""Winning by the minimum and keeping the clean sheet makes it more valuable not to concede.""Karim Benzema did not train on Friday and was not included in Real Madrid's match-day squad, with the club hoping the French forward will be at full strength for the Clasico next weekend.The striker failed to score in the two matches he has played since his return from a thigh injury and it didn't take Los Blancos long to move in front without him.Militao headed home from Luka Modric's perfect corner in the fourth minute. It was the perfect way for the Brazilian defender to celebrate his 100th appearance for the club.Borja Mayoral should have levelled against his former side but was unable to turn home Fabrizio Angileri's cross-shot as Getafe bit back after Madrid's intense start.Madrid put together a slick team move before the break which ended with David Soria saving a Rodrygo header, before Vinicius Junior drew a penalty -- or so he thought.The Brazilian was clumsily felled in the area by Luis Milla but VAR spotted the ball had gone out of play in the build-up.Madrid were foiled again before the hour mark when Rodrygo dinked the ball over Soria following a ricochet into his path, but the goal was disallowed for offside.Getafe did their best to keep Madrid at arm's length, with Vincius at his silky best on the ball, albeit too far from goal to do more damage.With Rodrygo showing his talent too, it will be hard for Ancelotti to work out whom he might drop to fit Benzema back into the side.Correa doubleArgentine forward Correa was at his explosive best to help Atletico, fourth, recover from a chastening defeat by Club Brugge in the Champions League in midweek.""We are working to get higher up in La Liga, which is a complicated competition,"" said Correa. ""The Champions League is coming next and we want to win to bring our fans happiness.""Antoine Griezmann started the game at the Metropolitano, amid reports in Spain that Atletico and Barcelona have settled on a transfer fee to make his loan move permanent.He played a pivotal role in Atletico's opener, with his clipped cross finished by Correa at the back post.Then the Argentine striker intercepted Girona goalkeeper Juan Carlos's pass early in the second half and stroked home his second.Rodrigo Riquelme, on loan from Atletico, pulled Girona back into the game with a deflected drive from distance against his parent club, but they could not find the leveller.At the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, Sampaoli started his second stint at the helm of Sevilla with an exciting battle against Ernesto Valverde's third-place Athletic Bilbao.Sevilla came flying out of the blocks and Oliver Torres slid home after little more than three minutes.Mikel Vesga levelled the scores with a long-range drive in the second half.Sevilla remain 17th but under Sampaoli, who coached them in the 2016-17 season, they will be hopeful of clawing their way up the table.Almeria beat Rayo Vallecano 3-1 earlier Saturday."

However, large industrial and corporate houses and individuals are not eligible to bid.Bids can be submitted by single entities or as part of a consortium and potential bidders should have a minimum capital net worth of at least 225 billion Indian rupees or $2.85 billion.The short-listed bidders will also have to pass a ""fit and proper"" assessment of the central bank. The successful bidder will be required to make an open offer to public shareholders of IDBI Bank.The public holds a 5.29 per cent stake in IDBI Bank as of the end of June.The successful bidder will also be mandated to lock in at least 40 per cent of the paid up and voting equity share capital of IDBI Bank for five years from the date of the acquisition.In the case of a consortium, there will be a lock-in in proportion to holdings of the investment vehicle, according to the central bank guidelines.The ceiling on voting rights is set at 26 per cent in line with existing rules for private banks. Even though state-owned LIC and the government hold a majority stake in IDBI Bank, the government categorises it as a private lender.The last date for submission of expression of interest has been set at December 16.The government announced plans to sell its stake in IDBI Bank last year, something it has considered for several years.""The bank's financial health has improved and it is in a much better position now, so it may not be as difficult to divest a stake in the bank as it was five-six years ago,"" said Ashvin Parekh, an independent banking consultant.IDBI is a mid-sized lender which in the three months to June 30 made a net profit of 7.56 billion rupees, up from 6.03 billion rupees a year earlier. Net bad loans were 19.9 per cent."

To contribute to her community, she wanted to keep on studying in school.But life doesn't always go according to plan  for a poor girl from a small Lalmonirhat village. Her father couldn't afford her education, so Setara had to drop out when she was in eighth grade.The next years of her life was a story of  agony. After her father passed away, she was married off to Shamsul Alam, known among locals as Shamsu Pagla, because he suffered from mental illness.But Setara isn't the one who surrenders. She remained by his side  in every way possible.Earlier, Shamsul used to sell nuts and eggs  in the village. Besides, doing household chores, Setara often accompanied him.Setara and Shamsul don't have any land of their own and have been  living in a small tin-shed house at  Mogholhat of Lalmonirhat for  years.""Look, many people are not so kind to an individual like my husband. They used to mock him. But my sheer presence used to comfort him a great deal,"" she told this correspondent.Every day at the break of dawn, Setara sets out from her home.

So much so that the same locals financed her entire campaign. And she ended up winning.When the results came out on November 28, 2021, it showed Setara securing  2,600 votes, while her competitor got 1,700.Now the 37-year-old Setara is on a mission to give back to her voters, working tirelessly for them.Every day at the break of dawn, she sets out from her home with a bag on her shoulder, accompanied by her husband.""I'm happy to have Shamsul as my husband. I don't let him sell nuts and eggs anymore,"" she said.Her bag contains various important  documents, including those on how to get old-age or disability allowance and how to apply for a VGD card. She goes from village to village, hearing problems and trying to solve them as soon as possible, covering at least five villages on foot daily.Day labourer Nazar Ali (50) of Etapota village told The Daily Star  that his son Shihab Islam (14) has physical disabilities. With Setara's help, his son got a disability allowance card. And for this, he did not have to spend any money.""She is always there for us. She is like our guardian angel,"" he added.Hawa Begum (63) of the same village said Setara arranged for her treatment at the local government facility after hearing that Hawa had been sick for a long time.Abia Begum (60) of Megharam village said  she tried to get a  VGD card for a long time, but in vain. ""One evening, Setara came to my house and arranged for a card.""Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) programme is one of the largest social security programmes of the government for the development of distressed women.Mogholhat UP Chairperson Habibur Rahman said, ""Setara Begum didn't understand anything about official work at first. Now she does her job well. She prefers to roam the field more than sitting in the UP office.""Setara still lives in the  small tin-shed house like before. ""My husband receives disability allowance, and I get a small honorarium for my post. I'm happy with this,"" she said.The house where they live is owned by Anwar Hossain.""Setara and her husband didn't have a roof over their head before. So I helped them build their home. Now, she is helping others as an elected representative. What more can I ask for?"" said Anwar. "

/star-health/news/act-fast-stroke-3138656,Act fast on a stroke,"A stroke is a medical emergency. It happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts or, more commonly, when a blockage happens. Without treatment, cells in the brain quickly begin to die. This can cause serious disability or death. If a loved one is having stroke symptoms, seek emergency medical support immediately.Stroke symptomsThese may include sudden:• Numbness or weakness of the body, especially on one side• Vision changes in one or both eyes, or trouble swallowing• Severe headache with an unknown cause• Problems with dizziness, walking, or balance• Confusion, trouble speaking or understanding othersThink FASTThe FAST test helps spot symptoms. It stands for:• Face drooping. Ask for a smile. Does one side droop?• Arm weakness or numbness.•Speech. Can the person repeat a simple sentence? Do they have trouble or slur words?•Don't make delay seeking emergency medical support.Time = Brain damageEvery second counts. Without oxygen, brain cells begin dying within minutes. Once brain tissue has died, the body parts controlled by that area won't work right. This makes stroke a top cause of long-term disability. There are clot-busting drugs that can curb brain damage, and they must be given in a short time -- usually within 3 hours of when symptoms start.Ischemic strokeThis is the most common type of stroke: Nearly nine out of 10 fall into this category. An ischemic stroke happens when a blood clot blocks the supply of blood to or in the brain. The clot may start in that spot or travel through the blood from elsewhere in the body. Clogged arteries are a top cause.Hemorrhagic strokeHemorrhagic strokes happen when a weakened blood vessel in the brain bursts. The result is bleeding inside the brain that can be hard to stop. The most common cause is high blood pressure. Other causes include aneurysms and AVMs (arteriovenous malformations), which weaken blood vessels in he brain.'Mini-stroke' (TIA)Transient ischemic attacks, often called ""mini-strokes,"" are also an emergency. When they happen, blood flow is temporarily hampered in part of the brain, causing stroke-like symptoms. When the blood flows again, the symptoms stop. You can't tell at the time if it's a stroke or TIA. Having a TIA is also a warning sign, so see your doctor if you think you've had one.Risk factorsYour chance of having a stroke rises with age and if you have:• Had a stroke or TIA before• Heart disease• High blood pressure• High cholesterol• Diabetes• Obesity• Sickle cell diseaseSmoking, heavy drinking, and not being active also raise your risk.What's on your plate?Eating too much fat and cholesterol can cause plaque to narrow arteries. Too much salt may lead to high blood pressure. Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish may help lower your stroke risk.Lowering your riskFind out if you have any conditions that you need to treat to help prevent a stroke. That may mean taking medicine and also boosting healthy habits, from the foods you eat to being active and not smoking. It is never too late to start.Source: WebMD"

The jobless rate dropped to 5.2 per cent, topping predictions it would remain at 5.4 per cent.The September employment gain ended a three-month streak of losses, though it barely dented the 113,500 net jobs lost in June through August. The drop in Canada's unemployment rate came as fewer people searched for work, Statscan said.""Given the declines of the previous three months, this is a pretty tepid rebound,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.""The unemployment rate falling - it looks like a good thing at face value, but a lot of that does reflect a lower participation rate.""Canada's labour force shrank by a net 20,300 in August, while the participation rate edged down to 64.7 per cent from 64.8 per cent.Wage growth for permanent employees eased to 5.2 per cent from 5.6 per cent in August but was above 5.0 per cent for the fourth consecutive month.""I think on balance, there are signs that labor markets are still strong, but softening,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, adding it would not be enough for Canada's central bank to change course.""You would have really needed a big downside surprise in labor markets to really derail them from more aggressive interest rate hikes,"" he said.Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem made clear on Thursday the central bank would not yet be pivoting away from its rapid pace of interest rate increases as it has yet to see core inflation ease.Economists and money markets are leaning toward a 50-basis-point increase on October 26. Canada's central bank has lifted rates by 300 bps since March, one of its steepest and fastest tightening cycles ever.The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3 per cent higher at 1.3710 to the greenback, or 72.94 US cents.US employers hired more people than expected in September, separate data showed on Friday, with that country's unemployment rate dropping to 3.5 per cent in September. Canada's unemployment rate, if measured in US terms, would be 4.1 per cent, Statscan said.The agency also provided new data on Canadians aged 55 to 64 who were not in the labor force, with 57.5 per cent - or roughly 1 million - saying they were retired. There were 3.4 million Canadians aged 55 to 64 actives in the labour force in September.Canada is grappling with a mass exodus of its most highly skilled workers, as more people than ever are retiring."

/business/economy/news/furniture-fair-offers-huge-discounts-3138426,Furniture fair offers huge discounts,"After a two-year gap for the pandemic, an annual National Furniture Fair kicked off in Dhaka last Thursday with manufacturers trying to woo customers with free home deliveries and discounts of 10 per cent to 25 per cent. Organised by Bangladesh Furniture Industry Owners Association under the management of Design and Technology Center, this 17th edition of the five-day fair is open at the capital's International Convention City Bashundhara from 10:00am to 8:00pm.There are 182 stalls of 34 organisations, including Regal Furniture, HATIL, Akhtar Furnishers, Navana Furniture, Partex Furniture, Nadia Furniture and Brothers Furniture.Kamruzzaman Kamal, marketing director at Pran-RFL Group, which exports products under its Regal Furniture brand, said they were offering discounts of up to 20 per cent and free home delivery.""We manufacture furniture for all segments of customers at affordable prices,"" he said, adding that Regal Furniture was displaying office and home furniture at the fair.The organisers said one aim of the event was to increase exports.Export of furniture from the country has increased at a significant rate.Furniture worth of $190.36 million was exported in fiscal year 2021-2022, 38.87 per cent higher than that in the previous year.Currently, Bangladesh exports furniture to India, Nepal, the US, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Europe.Talking to The Daily Star, Selim H Rahman, chairman and managing director of HATIL, one of the leading exporters, said their target was more about promoting the furniture sector through the display of new products of unique designs.Industry insiders believe the combined annual sale of home and office furniture by both the organised and unorganised sectors was currently at around Tk 26,000 crore.In contrast, it was only Tk 6,700 crore in 2012 according to a European Union report. "
/news/bangladesh/transport/news/third-shitalakkhya-bridge-opens-tomorrow-3138401,Third shitalakkhya bridge: 3-year project finally done in 12 years,"Nine years behind schedule and costing 61 percent more, the Third Shitalakkhya Bridge is finally going to be opened to the public tomorrow.Roads and Highways Department in November 2010 had taken up the project to establish a direct link between Narayanganj city and Bandar upazila.It was supposed to be done by 2013 for Tk 377.62 crore, from Saudi Arabia.The project authorities, however, took over six years just to hire consultants and contractors and the work on the ground began in 2017.In the meantime, the project cost escalated to Tk 608.56 crore.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will open the 1.23km bridge to the public tomorrow.Time extension and cost escalations are nothing new for RHD projects and it exposes its weaknesses in implementing such work.A report of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division on 49 projects, completed in fiscal 2016-17, shows that 41 of them required time extension and suffered cost escalation.Taking up projects without proper feasibility studies and estimation of costs, long delays in the tender process, and dividing project work into ""small packages"" to benefit influential but non-professional contractors are among the key reasons behind the delays, the report pointed out.Delays in land acquisition, moving utility lines and frequent changes of project directors were also blamed for the poor show, the report said.In the last fiscal year, RHD completed 44 projects but only three were done within their original deadlines. Most of the other 41 missed their original deadlines by more than two years. Some got delayed by three to four years.WHY THE DELAY?The Shitalakkhya river is between Bandar upazila and Narayanganj city.The only direct road connection is through the Kanchpur Bridge (Shitalakkhya-1 Bridge), which currently requires nearly 30km of travel, according to RHD documents.Once the four-lane bridge with walkways is opened to the public, people will have to travel less than two kilometres to reach Narayanganj city from Bandar upazila.The Executive Committee of National Economic Council in November 2010 approved the project setting a cost of Tk 377.62 crore, of which 311.64 crore was supposed to be provided by Saudi Arabia as loan.But the project faced different problems including frequent changes of project directors and officials and long delays in getting approval from the Saudi side, sources at the RHD said.The current project director is the 10th of the project, they said.Project authorities had to go through the tender process twice to appoint consultants and contractors.After the second bidding, when the project authorities went for appointing the selected bidder, it was found that the Chinese company was banned by a multi-lateral lender, leading the authorities to go for the second bidder. The process also took time.The Covid-19 pandemic and the slow flow of money from Saudi Arabia are the other reasons behind the delay, they said.In the meantime, project cost rose to Tk 608.56 crore, largely due to the high cost of land acquisition.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation stone of the project in February 2015 and the project authorities signed an agreement with the Chinese company Sinohydro Corporation Ltd in February 2017.Once the bridge is in service, vehicles from southern districts would not need to got to the capital's Jatrabari to go to Chattogram, RHD officials said.However, RHD must expand the existing road for establishing a better link, they added."

However, the contribution of agricultural officials is no less,"" he added.The event was chaired by NAAB President Dr MA Quassem.While presenting a paper on livestock and poultry, Professor Nitish Chandra Debnath, national coordinator of One Health Bangladesh, said poultry egg and meat consumption were expected to rise 1.3 times and 4 times respectively by 2031.""So, the government should strengthen the regulatory framework with the necessary setup, standards and tools to ensure private sector participation for a healthy and safe production system,"" he added. "
/star-health/news/food-labelling-should-show-how-much-physical-activity-needed-burn-the-calories-not-only-the-number-3138641,"Food labelling should show how much physical activity is needed to burn off the calories, not only the number of calories","New research from the UK shows that food labelling that includes the amount of physical activity needed to burn off the calories contained within it would be easier to understand than existing traffic light labelling, and would be more likely to help consumers to avoid high calorie foods. The study is by Professor Amanda Daley, Professor of Behavioural Medicine at Loughborough University, UK, and colleagues.This so-called physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) labelling was also found to be more popular among people aged under 65 years and those who are more physically active during a typical week, found the authors.PACE provides another approach to nutrition labelling by providing calorie information with a meaningful interpretation of what the calorie content of the food means in terms of energy expenditure. It aims to illustrate how many minutes of physical activity are equivalent to the calories contained in food and drinks. For example: ""calories in this cake requires 90 minutes of walking to burn off."" - see examples in the link below. Some mobile phone apps for nutrition already incorporate PACE information.The authors explain that while there is some evidence that PACE labelling may be effective in reducing calorie consumption, there is a lack of evidence about the views of the public concerning potential implementation in food settings. This new study obtained data from a nationally representative sample of adults recruited via the UK Ipsos KnowledgePanel.More participants thought PACE was more likely to help them avoid high calorie food than traffic light labelling (44% vs 28%). Those aged 65 years and older were 40% less likely to prefer PACE over traffic light labelling compared with the youngest group (18-44 years).There was a preference for PACE labelling to be placed on discretionary foods, for example chocolate and cakes, rather than 'every day' food items like bread, pasta, fruit and vegetables, and a preference for PACE to be displayed in fast food outlets, supermarkets, takeaway/online menus and vending machines, all locations that typically sell high energy dense food and drinks."

/news/bangladesh/news/mental-healthcare-grossly-neglected-3138596,Mental healthcare grossly neglected,"Pabna Mental Hospital, once considered the most reliable mental-health facility in the country, has seen its service crumble in recent decades.For years, admitted patients have been missing the quality care expected of the 500-bed state-run hospital, which would include nutritious meals, prescribed medications, and specialised treatments.Family members of former patients have claimed that the overall standard of medical care is not good enough to ensure that patients fully recover.In early September, the then hospital's acting director Dr Roton Kumar Roy issued an office order to stop admitting new patients, citing a supply shortage of food, medicine, and other necessities.However, the order was withdrawn a day later, after the health directorate assured that it would provide the necessary support.This turn of events led The Daily Star to launch an investigation, which revealed a number of factors for why the institution has been struggling over the years.These include the presence of an unscrupulous contractor syndicate that is responsible for food and medicine supply; the lack of specialist doctors; and the pervasive interference of brokers.INADEQUATE MEALS, MEDICATION
While hospital sources claim that the facility follows a diet plan and serves meat, vegetables, and other food items accordingly, former inmates and their families are not satisfied.
On condition of anonymity, family members of two former patients spoke to The Daily Star, raising allegations over the food quality.
Manik (not his actual name), an ex-patient hailing from Bagerhat, spent three months at the hospital last year.
According to his brother, Manik was a man of healthy build, but when he was released from the hospital, he returned home sickly thin.
""Every day, it was the same dishes cooked with pangas fish and broiler chicken. Although it tasted horrible, Manik had to eat, otherwise he would starve,"" he said.
Another former patient, Roton (not his actual name), had been admitted to the hospital twice but could not fully recover.
His wife said, ""My husband often complained about the food, so I used to seek permission from the ward doctor to send him food from outside.""
According to the diet plan, each patient is supposed to get three meals and one evening snack per day.
During a visit to the hospital, this correspondent found that a large amount of food had to be dumped every day as most patients could not eat it.
Speaking on the matter, Dr Shafquat Waheed, the newly appointed director, said the food budget is inadequate for quality meals.
""It is very difficult to provide quality meals four times a day with the allotted Tk 125 per day for each patient. The lack of funds results in the same meals being served over and over again, and a lot of food going to waste every day.""
Meanwhile, complaints also surfaced about the hospital not providing patients with the prescribed medications it is supposed to.
Manik's brother said, ""On top of the poor-quality food, my brother also did not get all the prescribed medicine due to a supply shortage.""
Regarding this, Dr Shafquat claimed that the hospital never prescribed medicines that were not in supply.
 








UNDER THE SYNDICATE'S CLUTCH
The Daily Star found that the institution spent a substantial amount of money on the purchase of food and medicine.
And for years, a syndicate of unscrupulous contractors have been consistently getting the work orders.
They reportedly used their influence to embezzle money by providing subpar food and inadequate medicine.
The syndicate is run by three contractor companies that supply food to the hospital. The companies are owned by three brothers in Pabna -- HM Foysal, HM Rejaul and HM Arefin.
When questioned, HM Rejaul claimed that they legally participate in the tender process by competing with other bidders to offer the lowest price.
""When we decided to make changes in the traditional tendering process to break up the syndicate, Rose Enterprise, a company that supplies food to the hospital, filed a lawsuit last year,"" said Dr Roton.
Due to the legal battle with the contractor, supply of food and medicine has been disrupted for the past few months.
""We are managing food for patients from local traders through vouchers, as per the arrangement made by a hospital committee. I'm entitled to spend Tk 10 lakh a year by using vouchers. But in the last two months, I already used up vouchers worth over Tk 37 lakh,"" Dr Roton had said.
Meanwhile, Dr Shafquat said, ""We've come to know that the court stay has been removed, but we are yet to get the official papers to this end. If we get the papers, we can go for fresh bidding, but the total process requires time.""
""This time, we have suggested using an online tendering process to escape the syndicate's control,"" he added.
In June, Anti-Corruption Commission sued the three brothers and two others for allegedly embezzling Tk 88 lakh by manipulating the prices of essential commodities while making a purchase.
The other accused were the hospital's former director Dr Tonmoy Prokash Bishwas, and former marketing officer Humayun Kabir.
LACK OF SPECIALISED TREATMENT FACILITIES
Besides the issues with food and medicine supply, the country's oldest specialised mental-health institution also lacks provision for advanced care, which is quite unheard of in neighbouring nations.
The key reason behind this shortcoming is the facility's shortage of specialised doctors.
The hospital has only 10 doctors on staff, severely limiting its capacity to deliver quality care.
Additionally, it lacks other essential staff members.
According to official sources, important departments could not operate for many years due to a lack of dentists, anesthesiologists, and psychotherapists.
Dr Masud Rana, a resident psychologist, said, ""Of the 31 posts of doctors, only 10 are occupied. So, it is quite a tough job to run a 500-bed facility, with an overwhelming number of patients.""
""As a result, we are unable to provide essential treatments like electroconvulsive therapy and psychotherapy, while general practitioners are left to handle dental issues,"" he added.
Of around 643 positions, 176 are vacant, which seriously hinders the provision of proper medical care, he mentioned.
According to official data, the hospital admitted 12,290 patients between 2014 and 2021, and 12,108 of them have been discharged after receiving treatment.
In addition, 3,89,000 others received treatment in the outpatient department in the last seven years.
NO RESPITE FROM BROKERS
Many patients come in from outside the district, and they are more likely to fall prey to brokers, who whisk them away to one of several illegal private clinics that have sprung up around Pabna Mental Hospital.
These brokers also take money from unsuspecting family members in the name of admitting patients at the hospital.
Law enforcers have frequently conducted raids and arrested brokers.
However, these brokers are released after posting bail and immediately return to doing the same thing.
Speaking to The Daily Star, Pabna Civil Surgeon Dr Manisar Chowdhury said they have already closed many clinics for operating without licence.
""We are continuously monitoring the rise of illegal clinics,"" he added.
Asked about the long-standing problems at Pabna Mental Hospital, Dr Monisor said, ""Because the facility is managed independently by its own authority within the health directorate, we are unable to take any action in this regard.""

Eleven others were wounded in the latest violence to hit the West Bank, a day after two other Palestinian teenagers were killed by Israeli forces elsewhere in the territory. Israel's military said troops came under attack as they entered Jenin to detain a 25-year-old Palestinian it said was a member of the Islamic Jihad militant group.

/world/europe/news/us-ammo-supplies-dwindle-war-drains-stockpiles-3138631,US ammo supplies dwindle as war drains stockpiles,"The United States will soon be unable to provide Ukraine with certain types of ammunition that are essential to Kyiv's battle against Russia's invasion, as supplies are being used up faster than they can be replaced.Washington has become by far the largest supplier of arms to Ukraine since Russia launched the invasion on February 24, with more than $16.8 billion in military assistance provided since that date.But US stockpiles of some equipment are ""reaching the minimum levels needed for war plans and training,"" and restocking to pre-invasion levels could take years, Mark Cancian of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a recent analysis.Washington is ""learning lessons"" from the conflict about ammunition needs in a great power war, which are ""far greater"" than expected, a US military official acknowledged on condition of anonymity.American defence firms were forced to drastically reduce production in the 1990s as the United States slashed defence spending following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and their number fell dramatically, from dozens to single digits.Now, the US government must convince the industry to reopen assembly lines and relaunch production of items such as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which have not been made since 2020.Some US-provided equipment has become emblematic of the war in Ukraine, such as Javelin anti-tank weapons that were widely used by Kyiv's forces to blunt the Russian advance on the capital, and the Himars, a precision rocket system now playing a key role in counter-offensives against Moscow's troops in the east and south.But US stocks of ammunition for Himars -- which fires GPS-guided rockets known as GMLRS, with a range of more than 80 kilometers (50 miles) -- are dwindling.""If the United States sent one-third of that inventory to Ukraine (as has been the case with Javelin and Stinger), Ukraine would receive 8,000 to 10,000 rockets. That inventory would likely last several months, but, when the inventory is exhausted, there are no alternatives,"" said Cancian, who previously worked on weapons procurement for the US government.""Production is about 5,000 a year. Although the United States is working to increase that amount, and money has recently been allocated for that purpose, it will take years,"" he said.The US has provided some 8,500 Javelin missiles to Kyiv, but annual production of a weapon that has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance is only about 1,000.The US has also supplied more than 800,000 Nato standard 155 mm artillery shells to Kyiv, according to official Pentagon statistics.US production of these shells currently stands at 14,000 per month, but the Pentagon has announced that it aims to increase that figure to 36,000 within three years. That would still only bring annual production to 432,000 -- less than half of what has been provided to Ukraine in seven months. "

/business/economy/news/imported-fish-should-undergo-more-tests-3138436,Imported fish should undergo more tests,"Sea fishers recently urged the government to ensure that imported fish undergo certain tests apart from those related to checking for the presence of health-hazardous chemicals, namely formalin.Marine fish that are currently imported from Middle Eastern countries at a relatively low cost should be tested for arsenic, mercury, and other heavy-metal contaminations to protect consumers, they said.""Besides, the fish imported from that region are sold at throwaway prices, which affects us too,"" said Nurul Qayyum Khan, president of the Bangladesh Marine Fisheries Association (BMFA).Khan said a portion of fish is imported for poultry feed and in such cases, they should be imported as granules.In a letter to the fisheries and livestock minister last week, the association appealed for ensuring that imported fish are searched for arsenic, mercury, lead, and cadmium contaminations apart from facing microbiological tests.The BMFA, which represents 200 industrial fishing trawlers in the Bay of Bengal, also urged the government for allowing them to buy diesel, the key raw material for trawlers, at reduced prices as it has become difficult for them to bear the increased fuel cost.Imported fish should be tested for arsenic, mercury, lead, and cadmium contaminations apart from facing microbiological tests, sea fishers say 


Imported fish should be tested for arsenic, mercury, lead, and cadmium contaminations apart from facing microbiological tests, sea fishers say ""We are on the verge of sinking,"" he said.The BMFA said an industrial trawler would require Tk 65 lakh for a voyage lasting 22 days when the price of diesel was Tk 65 per litre before the hike in November 2021. The cost went up 11 per cent to Tk 72 lakh after the government increased prices of the fuel to Tk 80 per litre.The fuel cost for a steel-body mechanised trawler that goes for fishing in the sea shot up 46 per cent to Tk 1.05 crore after the energy ministry hiked prices again in August this year.Khan said they cannot increase the prices of fish even though their costs have soared as it depends on the supply coming from other sources too.The BMFA president then said industrial trawlers can trawl for up to six months each year because of the government's restrictions on catching fish for a certain period.Khan said entrepreneurs invest Tk 30-35 crore for an industrial trawler by borrowing from banks.So, the increased cost of operation has affected their capacity to service loans, he said while demanding diesel for trawlers at Tk 80 per litre.Asked about the risk of leakage or sales to the market, he said the government will monitor to prevent that by devising modalities.Of those, fishermen and industrial trawlers can catch up to 30 types of fish with a majority comprising hilsha.The Bay of Bengal provides 15 per cent of the total annual production of fish estimated at 46.2 lakh tonnes in fiscal 2020-21, according to the Department of Fisheries (DoF).Marine fishing is the main source of income for nearly 500,000 fishermen living near the coast, as per a policy on marine fishing issued by the DoF.Some 200 industrial trawlers, around 350 wooden trawlers and 65,000 country boats are engaged in fishing the Bay of Bengal."
/opinion/editorial/news/dont-let-human-traffickers-the-hook-3138801,Don’t let human traffickers off the hook,"It's alarming that despite having a specialised legal infrastructure to prosecute human trafficking cases, Bangladesh has been registering appallingly low conviction rates. As per data from the Anti-Human Trafficking Offence Tribunal in Dhaka, around 1.5 percent of cases that it dealt with have resulted in convictions, meaning an overwhelming majority of accused criminals have been left off the hook. Reportedly, the Dhaka tribunal disposed of around 858 cases from March 2020 to August 2022. Of them, only 13 resulted in convictions, with 20 accused handed different jail terms.This is from just one special tribunal, however. Bangladesh has seven such tribunals tied with seven divisional cities which, according to the home ministry, have a combined total of around 5,781 cases still pending as of June. Although all 64 districts in the country are supposed to have a tribunal of their own, the fact that even the most visible of existing tribunals hasn't had any visible effect is quite telling. It demonstrates the futility of existing legal interventions in curtailing human trafficking, but also the perfunctory manner in which the seven tribunals were formed in 2020, amid a then-looming threat of US sanctions, although it was a major provision of the Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking Act passed eight years earlier.There is, clearly, a very bureaucratic vibe about how the government has been approaching this issue. It has ticked boxes that improved its standing in the US Trafficking in Persons (TIP) reports, but brought little change on the ground. After the release of the latest TIP report on July 19, 2022, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recognised Bangladesh's efforts but cautioned that the country is yet to fully meet the ""minimum"" standards for elimination of trafficking. It is the second part of his observation that worries us.The problems in the legal fight against trafficking are legion. For example, the general focus still seems to be more on disposal of cases than reaching convictions – the appearance of efforts rather than meaningful efforts. Although state officials like to attribute lack of convictions to the non-cooperation of victims, a report by The Daily Star shows the reasons are more diverse. It identified a combination of factors including absence of proper evidence in charge sheets, non-appearance of witnesses, out-of-court settlements, threats from the accused, and lack of expertise in dealing with the cases. One can assume that if state prosecutors and investigators performed their duties properly and with sincerity, a lot of the trials would have gone in a different direction.Overall, Bangladesh is taking baby steps when it should be taking giant strides given the complicated nature of these transnational crimes. There is no denying the importance of convictions in preventing them. It can send a powerful message that no one guilty of committing or abetting trafficking can get away without punishment. We urge the government to make more meaningful and sustained efforts, including removing systemic loopholes in the legal and administrative processes, so that no one can exploit laborers seeking to work overseas."
/news/bangladesh/news/univ-students-struggling-find-ground-3138591,Univ students struggling to find ground,"Two third of university students have been facing mental health issues due to overwhelming academic pressure in the post-pandemic world.Aachol Foundation disclosed the information in a virtual press conference  yesterday, based on  a survey, titled ""Impact of Academic Pressure on University Students and Their Suicidal Tendencies"".Abdul Wahab, researcher of Aachol Foundation and assistant professor of North South University,  presented the results of the survey.The survey conducted among 1,640 students, concluded  around 75.85 percent university students have been suffering from mental health issues after the pandemic.Students opined that session jams, difficulties in study, depressions over exam results and unusual curriculum are the key factors behind mental health troubles.Around 43.9 percent male and 56.1 female students from 38 public universities, 47 private universities, madrasas and national universities took part in the survey.The new scenario after the pandemic forced the student to study more during exams and have to complete the curriculum in less time than before.However, some 46.45 percent of students said they lost interest in studying properly after the pandemic period.Besides, when asked about mental health, some 80.79 percent of students said they feel depressed, and are often affected with bipolar disorders which in turn affects their academic life.This study also revealed that around 77.01 percent of students are having trouble finishing the huge syllabus in a short time.Meanwhile, some 73.84 percent of students are suffering from lack of confidence following changes made to the curriculum after the long Covid induced university closures. Besides, some 76.06 percent of students are in distress about their career.According to Aachol foundation, some 404 students have died by suicide since January this year, where 242 were female and 162 male.President of Bangladesh Psychological Association Prof Mahmudur Rahman and founder president of Aachol Foundation Tansen Rose were present at the event. "

/news/asia/south-asia/news/search-roots-bangladesh-discovered-leaves-3138571,"In search of roots in Bangladesh, discovered leaves","Maniruddin Chowdhury and Ratan Bhowmick were close friends. During the turbulence of 1970, Ratan moved to India with his family. Maniruddin, meanwhile, fought in the Liberation war of Bangladesh. Ratan's family lived in Uttarpara of West Bengal. After many years, Maniruddin went to Uttarpara, sat on the verandah of Ratan's house, and wanted to see his ""mashima"" (aunt). Ratan's sister said that their mother had died. This made Maniruddin weep uncontrollably. Maniruddin and Ratan's mother shared a mother-son like relationship. Ratan's nephew Shekhar Bhowmick narrated this story when he came to know about my proposed tour to Bangladesh.Despite our shared history and culture, we are divided by a border. Bangladesh is a foreign country on paper, despite the fact that I have often travelled here on the wings of stories heard in my childhood. The lullaby tales of my East Bengali grandparents were not just imagined stories. They were tales of communal riots and harmony, unbridled hatred and love. I had grown up with the mental landscapes of Jashore, Noakhali, Cumilla, Dhaka and many such places of today's Bangladesh. My first in-person trip to these places took me to my roots. And in search of my roots, I discovered so many unseen leaves.I was somewhat disgruntled with what happened in Bangladesh during Durga Puja last year. This was certainly not what Bangabandhu's Bangladesh was meant to be. This certainly didn't look like the country which sang in 1971 – ""Bir Bangali Austro Dhoro, Bangladesh Shadhin koro…"". Last year's violence looked alien for Bangladesh, which formed a constitution in 1972 on the principles of nationalism, socialism, democracy and secularism. Last year looked alien for a Bangladesh where valiant women like Ashalota Sen, Begum Sufia Kamal, Sanjeeda Khatun, Nilima Ibrahim and Motia Chowdhury didn't hesitate to put their lives in peril for a secular nation. However, after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh had witnessed some tumultuous political regimes intermittently. Whether it is the military-civil regime under Ziaur Rahman from 1975 to 1981 or the post-poll violence on minority Hindus in 2001, Mujib's dream has been attacked time and again.    A week-long stay in Bangladesh has enriched me as a researcher because it has taught me to explore beyond mere data. This trip has shown me that once a great soul and leader of a nation plants the seed of secularism, it will keep germinating time and again. As I travelled through districts like Dhaka, Noakhali, Gopalganj, Chattogram and Barishal, I have often seen glimmers of hope. I have seen hope in the form of young Muslim college students visiting Ramana Kalibari of Dhaka. I have seen hope when local Awami League councilor assured the Dhakeshwari Puja Committee of a Durga Puja free from the shadows of 2021 violence.What surprised me most during the entire trip is how a little village of Barishal has remembered the dalit leader and the first law minister of Pakistan, Jogendranath Mondal. Jogendranath resigned from office in 1950 because of the repression of minority Hindus in Pakistan. But his village still remembers him. The villagers have formed a committee in memory of Jogen Mondal. The committee, mostly comprised of Muslim members, still believes in the teachings of Jogendranath and hopes to nurture Hindu-Muslim unity. My visit to Orakandi in Gopalganj has shown me another Bangladesh where thousands visit during Baruni Mela.But, miles to go before Bangladesh feels content. I have also felt a sense of fundamentalism hovering around the secular air of the country. The evil forces that killed Bangabandhu along with most of his family members on that ominous night in 1975 is still trying to raise its head. The country has to take up the unfinished task of ensuring a homeland for Hindus where they feel safe, irrespective of the politics. Today's Bangladesh wants to spread the message, 'Dharma jaar jaar, utshab shobar"". And only by spreading this message, Bangladesh can fearlessly resonate Tagore's song, ""Amar shonar Bangla, ami tomaye bhalobasi"", which was selected by the government-in-exile in 1971.    Dr Avishek Biswas is Assistant Professor at Vidyasagar College (Affiliated to the University of Calcutta) and a researcher of oral history."

But they will need to make vast improvements if they wish to go one better at the World Cup after losing last year's final to Australia.""We played really well. Our bowlers bowled well in the first six and finished well too. As a captain, I am very happy. We assessed the conditions and executed the plans. Shadab played well and Nawaz too. We have done our best. We need to sit together and discuss before next game,"" said Azam.He said the rapid 61-run stand with Shadab for the third wicket gave an insight to a tactic they could employ at the World Cup, with the allrounder shifted up the order.""Definitely, we have a plan to send Shadab up to charge the bowlers, to utilise his skills. He played very well. We planned that I would go all the way and Shadab would take a chance.""""We came up against a quality opposition. Pakistan were clinical and it was hard to get a rhythm. If we got two big overs there, the total would've been competitive. The guys are feeling good, and we know it's a tough match tomorrow (against Bangladesh). Same surface, looking forward to tomorrow,"" said New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson.The hosts paid a heavy price for a straightforward dropped catch by Glenn Phillips at point off Tim Southee's bowling when Azam was on 27.The opener went on to post his 28th T20 international half-century, the equal second most alongside Rohit Sharma, with both sitting behind another Indian, Virat Kohli (33).""We pride ourselves in that area. Need to just switch on and hopefully a few learnings going into tomorrow night, ""Williamson said when asked about their uncharacteristic fielding performance."

And I had no idea whether ferries would be available after midnight. Now, I can return home from Pirojpur Sadar in 10 minutes using the bridge,"" said Jewel, a resident of Pirojpur's Kawkhali.He is one of the four partners who started Chandrabindu Party Palace and Resort Centre near the toll plaza of Bangamata Begum Fazilatun Nesa Mujib Eighth Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge, which was opened to the public on September 4.Jewel said anticipating business opportunities, he and three of his friends set up the restaurant on 40 decimals of land, investing a total of Tk 15 lakh.The restaurant opened in early July, when daily sales were worth Tk 7,000. After the bridge opened, the establishment started making around Tk 17,000 worth of sales a day.We had to wait for two to three hours to cross the river by ferry. And I had no idea whether ferries would be available after midnight. Now, I can return home from Pirojpur Sadar in 10 minutes using the bridge. Mahmud Hasan Jewel Resident of Pirojpur's Kawkhali
""I believe sales will go up even further, as more restaurants are being built nearby and there will be more traffic,"" he told this correspondent on Friday.



China Railway 17th Bureau Group Co Ltd constructed the 2.96-kilometre bridge, which was handed over to the Roads and Highways Department. The Chinese government has provided Tk 654 crore of Tk 894 crore, the total cost.
The bridge established direct road connectivity between Khulna and Barishal divisions. This connectivity covers Kuakata beach, Payra deep-sea port, Mongla sea port, and Benapole land port, said Weng Changnuin, deputy project manager of the bridge project.
Locals and businesses said the bridge has started contributing to trade and tourism. Moreover, it will promote better development of industries like agriculture, manufacturing, fishery and tourism in southern Bangladesh.
During a visit, this correspondent found the bridge buzzing with tourists, who were taking photos and enjoying the river-view in an autumn afternoon. New businesses are being set up by the roadside on both parts of the bridge, and along the riverbanks.
People from Barishal division can now easily go to Khulna to see the Sundarbans and Patuakhali sea beach, as well as for business purposes, said Jewel.
""Spices in Khulna are more abundant and cheaper. So, we can easily travel to Khulna and buy the stuff,"" he said. ""So, people can do more business and get jobs.""
Truckers said they can easily transport commodities from anywhere in the country to Barishal and Khulna divisions in less time, with lower transport costs.
""When there was no bridge, we had to wait for hours with trucks loaded. Now, we cross the river in a few minutes,"" said Jan-e-Alam, a truck driver who was going to Khulna from Bhola.
Habibur Rahman Malek, president of Pirojpur Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Padma Bridge and 8th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge have come as huge blessings for the country's southwestern region.
Before the 8th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge opened, only two trucks used to transport produce from Pirojpur to Dhaka. Now, that number has reached 40.
The farmers and fishers in Pirojpur can now get better prices for their produce, as transport time and costs have drastically gone down. A truck needs less than five hours to reach Dhaka from Pirojpur now, whereas it took more than a day in the past.
""As Mongla port is now being used to ship produce abroad, investors can easily think of building factories in this area. And so, our industries will also flourish,"" Malek said.

However, it has been a while since he was seen there.The actor spoke to The Daily Star about his recent works and future plans. Where are you now?I am currently at my hometown Pirojpur, for some personal work. My parents' graves are going through repair work, and I am supervising it. What else were you busy there with in your hometown?I went to a cultural event arranged for Durga Puja in Nesharabad, Pirojpur. When people learned about my arrival, 30 thousand people visited the event, despite the heavy rain. Besides, I have planted hundreds of plants in different areas through one of my organisations.There was a time when you would visit Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC) everyday. However, now you are not seen in that place anymore. Why is that? It has been almost 3 months since I went there. Many think that I am not going to FDC because of fear.The fact is that the environment there has been completely spoilt. The beautiful vibe that we created, is gone. Now, many people including YouTubers have come there and completely spoiled the atmosphere. Everyone knows who allowed them to come here.But, you are accused of bringing these YouTubers to the FDC…No one can prove that I brought these YouTubers to FDC. I cannot explain how bad the situation there is. They are making ambiguous comments about anyone they wish, and they don't even hesitate to talk bad about Shakib Khan either. It is important to prevent them first. Sadly, no organisation from FDC is taking the necessary steps.What happened to the post of General Secretary of the Film Artistes Association?I respect the law. I will accept any fair decision taken by law. But, what is happening now is unfair. Nipun has unfairly occupied the chair. It's not right –  they don't care about the law. Senior actor Ilyas Kanchan accepts the unfair occupation, that makes it even more frustrating. People like director Sohanur Rahman Sohan and Mohammad Hossain are supporting them in various ways.More than a year is left for the election of the artistes association. Do you wish to participate again?Nothing happened in this election. Let there be a solution and then we can talk about the next election. Nothing can be said before that.When was the last time you faced the camera?  When do you plan to return to shooting?I shot for the movie ""Shonar Chor"", around 9 months ago, and that was before the election held for the Film Artistes Association. After returning to Dhaka, I will work on the dubbing for the project.

I didn't know how many points I was going to get. I was happy with the race we had.""The race got off to a chaotic start in heavy rain, with Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and Williams' Alex Albon exiting on the first lap prompting a safety care.A red flag soon followed and forced the drivers to wait for more than an hour before the action restarted, again under a safety car.Verstappen resumed with a lead over Leclerc and Perez, and extended it as conditions gradually improved.Verstappen has won 12 of 18 races in 2022 and thanked his team for an ""incredible"" year.""The first (championship) is a little more emotional, the second one is beautiful,"" he said.""It's been a special year, and you need to remind yourself as these kind of years you don't have very often.""Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said Verstappen had ""grown"" as a driver.""Carrying that number one this year, he's done it with a lot of pride,"" he said."
/star-health/news/knowing-narcissist-3138646,Knowing a narcissist,"It is interesting that it is hard to find a proper Bangla word that goes with the term 'Narcissistic', while it is such a vital topic in the world of 'personality'. This is a personality disorder that involves a pattern of self-centered, arrogant thinking and behaviour, a lack of kindness and consideration for others. They are self-centered and envy others, or believe others envy them. They believe that they are special and demand excessive admiration.Well, sometimes we all may show some narcissistic traits, especially in cases of teenagers, as a part of their growth processes - they want attention, put their needs first, or think they are special. But most of the time, when we mature, educate ourselves and try to understand the meaning of life, most of us become sensible with others and admit our mistakes. But, this is not the case with people who have narcissistic personality disorder — they are excessively self-involved, and they disregard other people's needs and it may become harmful for society.But what is about 'silent narcissist' or a 'covert narcissist'? As these characters often hide many of their typical signs and symptoms. They can also be destructive. They may appear to be shy and modest, but inside they are chronically envious of others, can't handle criticism, and lack kindness for others. Hidden narcissists may interrupt a conversation, may make dismissive remarks that will make some feel that their opinions do not matter.A narcissist is actually an incredibly sad, unhappy and melancholic person and sooner or later hurts everyone who cares for them and is not able to control their behaviour. According to Social-Psychologists, people with strong narcissistic tendencies hate seeing others do well and they are chronically miserable people who desperately try to feel better by constantly managing their fragile and crooked sense of pride. These people are unable to feel genuine happiness because they lack a sense of genuine self and it is established that the 'true happiness' comes from within.

It would be in 2004, that Star Cineplex would bring out the first multiplex cinema theatre in Bangladesh. In attendance at the anniversary event were the team of the upcoming movie, ""Damal"".The journey over these last 18 years has not been easy for the organisation. ""The first two years, we had to reignite the culture of cinema in Bangladesh. Right around that time, many halls had closed down, and people had forgotten about the experience of going to cinemas. We entered this industry, which was almost dying, with our own multiplex cinema hall. It was quite a risky venture,"" said Mahboob Rahman Ruhel, the founder of Star Cineplex.Rahman also shared with those in attendance at the anniversary event, that there were times when he thought this would all come to an end. That cinema theatres would just die out in Bangladesh. This was particularly the case during the COVID-19 pandemic.""However, watching cinema is in our DNA. Visiting theatres is a social event. So, during COVID many people came forth to support us. Our Bashundhara Star Cineplex was going to be shut down, we had even announced it. But then I noticed how the community came forward, how everyone from Jaya Ahsan to other celebrities came forward to support us. That's when I realised that Star Cineplex isn't our own brand, rather it is a brand of the people of Bangladesh,"" reminisced Rahman.The founder and film producer then proceeded to discuss his plans that someday, Star Cineplex would have 100 screens across Bangladesh. He also praised the Honourable Prime Minister for creating the initiative that allows hall owners to take long-term loans, with minimal interest, if they want to build more cinema halls.A passionate Rahman then discussed the success of Bangladeshi films in recent years, listing off names like ""Hawa"", ""Poran"", ""Rehana Maryam Noor"", and ""Operation Sundarban"". He also mentioned that ""Hawa"" had broken all of their box-office records.The man behind the screenplay of ""No Dorai"" also noted the recent success of OTT. He mentioned that while OTT has changed the Bangladeshi audience's taste for content, it cannot encapsulate the same feeling as when going to the cinema hall, and watching a movie on the big screen. ""The fact that Bangladeshi films are beating franchises like 'Avengers' and 'Avatar', at the box-office, is great news for all of us.

Since then, student attendance hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels.While primary education facilities may be found in some schools, higher education is still a far cry due to poverty-stricken inaccessibility.Chars are fleeting by nature, made from the ebbs and flows of silt. Not every char has a school and those that do, struggle to stay open. Like all char structures, schools are impermanent and need to be shifted often.Besides, teachers find it difficult to make the commute from the mainland, frequently missing classes.With only a few schools holding classes every day, students who want to attend from surrounding chars have to travel quite a distance.These challenges lead many to drop out. Girls get married off and boys find work to help with family expenses.While the government provides textbooks free of cost, without access to subsidised school supplies, it will be impossible to improve the literacy rate in the underprivileged char areas, education experts say.During visits to some shops in the districts, this correspondent found that prices had risen for all school supplies including school uniforms, shoes, bags, pens, pencils, erasers, sharpeners, markers, loose paper, notebooks, geometry boxes, plastic while boards, scales, calculators, and colouring pencils.The price of a rim of white paper used by students for making notebooks is now Tk 1,250, up from Tk 750 two months ago.Similarly, a rim of newsprint paper is being sold at Tk 1,150, up from Tk 700.Meanwhile, the price of ballpoint pens has risen by Tk 15-20 per dozen, and plastic whiteboards and geometric boxes are being sold at twice the price.Abdul Hadi (40), a rickshaw puller in Kurigram's Chilmari upazila, has child who's a Mondolerghat Govt Primary School student.He said, ""We have to cut back on meals in order to send my children to school.""Md Nuruzzaman (50), who's child goes to Purba Satunama Aminpara Govt Primary School at Satunama Char in Nilphamari's Dimla upazila, said, ""I couldn't afford a new pair of shoes and a bag for my child. The price of the cheapest pair of shoes is Tk 600 and an ordinary school bag is Tk 550, which were Tk 450 and Tk 300 just a few weeks ago.""Khalilur Rahman, the headmaster of Purba Satunama Aminpara Govt Primary School, said, ""The school has a total of 250 students, most of whom come from families who are river erosion victims. They come to class barefooted and without the necessary school supplies. We cannot but be understanding of their situation.""District Primary Education Officer Nobez Uddin Sarker, said, ""We request that the district administration increases monitoring in order to stop the syndicate responsible for the price hike of school supplies.""   "

Shanto and Liton Das produced a decent partnership before the wicketkeeper-batter gave a return catch of Michael Bracewell as Bangladesh's capitulation started."

/business/economy/news/knitwear-continues-dominance-export-3138516,Knitwear continues dominance in export,"The knitwear segment has retained its position as the country's biggest export earner in the readymade garment industry and among all the sectors of Bangladesh. But the journey has not been smooth.In its early years, it had to navigate through a quota system and securing raw materials was not easy as imports were the only option. Now it is facing mounting challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine.The knitwear segment overtook the woven sub-sector for the first time in the financial year of 2007-08 and held the pole position until 2010-11.The woven outran the knitwear segment in 2011-12 and the dominance continued till 2019-20.In 2020-21, knitwear outran woven and recaptured the glory. And it continued in the last fiscal year as well as it brought home $23.21 billion, versus the woven's $19.40 billion.Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector 


Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector Even in July to September, the first quarter of the current financial year when the overall export earnings showed a falling trend, the knitwear segment grew 9.40 per cent year-on-year to $5.64 billion because of a strong demand amid the raging war and unprecedented inflation in the eurozone and the US.Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector.Fast fashion and putting on casual dress have increased the use of knitwear items in the last one decade. Nowadays, even executives wear casual dresses at offices instead of formal ones. Knitwear like functional sportswear is used as dresses for formal events worldwide.Fashion connoisseurs prefer knitwear items since it is comfortable and easy to wash. Moreover, product diversification has taken place within the segment.When Covid-19 brought the entire world to a screeching halt and damaged the global supply chain severely and businesses hit rock bottom, the country's knitwear sector put on a good show, surprisingly, as Bangladesh kept supplying garment items to the world amid the raging flu.The segment also felt some damage.The slowdown in the knitwear shipment was first noticed in March 2020 when earnings stood at a paltry $1.05 billion. It fell further in April, to $180.2 million.But it rebounded in the following month as exporters fetched $608.38 million since people were forced to spend more time indoors to avoid catching the deadly virus. The receipts sprinted to $1.16 billion in June.""It was surprising that the demand for knitwear items started climbing even during Covid-19 when the global supply chain came to a standstill. In fact, knitwear export has continued to surge,"" said Md Fazlul Hoque, managing director of Plummy Fashions, a Narayanganj-based knitwear exporter.""The use of knitwear items has risen as consumers spent more time at home. During their long stay indoors, western consumers mostly use T-shirts.""Historically, the knitwear sector was groomed in Bangladesh because of the quota system which started in the late 1970s and was in place until 2004.In the early days, knitwear manufacturers, particularly those based in Narayanganj, used to ship knitwear items as the European Union granted the facility of a quota system that was not rigorous and was less cumbersome. So, a strong market was created for local knitwear items.In fact, Bangladesh made the most of the quota system, sowing the seed for today's gigantic knitwear industry.The EU and other developing and developed countries later eased the Rules of Origin for knitwear items, allowing the least-developed countries such as Bangladesh to qualify for the generalised system of preferences in the trade bloc even if imported cotton and yarn are used to ship export-oriented goods.This prompted knitwear producers to invest a lot of money in the sector and broaden their manufacturing prowess.Subsequently, entrepreneurs also pumped money to produce yarn and other raw materials for the knitwear sector.Currently, nearly 90 per cent of raw materials are procured from the local market, cutting reliance on China, a major feat for the industry as it more than halved the lead time.Even five years ago, the US was not a major market for knitwear manufacturers.""Today, the US has turned into a major export destination for us,"" said Hoque.Three years ago, the export of knitwear items from his factory to the US was almost zero whereas the world's biggest economy is his main buyer now.Mohammad Hatem, executive president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said demand for knitwear items has not fallen despite higher inflation in the eurozone and the US.Competitive prices are a major factor in Bangladesh's success in the knitwear sector.""The export of knitwear items has kept rising and the momentum will continue in the future as well,"" Hatem said.Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, expects the dominance of knitwear in exports to continue for the next few years as raw materials are easy to procure and the demand for casual wear has lifted the demand for knitwear products.Currently, more than 1,200 knitwear factories are in operation in Bangladesh, employing over 14.50 lakh workers."

A court decision in 2023 will be crucial in determining the project's future.""There are no football clubs among the ten richest entities in the world, we must be doing something very wrong in old Europe,"" Perez explained.Perez led a group of 12 major European clubs into the Super League project in April 2021 but it vanished a few days after it was announced after pressure from fans and authorities.The only clubs that have tried to keep alive a league that would be direct competition for the Champions League are Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus.Perez compared European football with tennis.""What is the point of depriving the fans of the big matches? Nadal and Federer met 40 times. Nadal and Djokovic, 59, is it boring? Liverpool and Real Madrid have faced nine times in 67 years,"" he told the Madrid's members assembly.The Super League project came back to life in July, when litigation for an alleged abuse of a dominant position by UEFA was brought to the European Union Court of Justice, at the request of a Madrid judge to whom the Super League chiefs turned.'Healthy and beautiful'UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin responded to Perez.""Once again he has shown that his idea is to close everything off, without games against smaller teams,"" he told a news conference in Rome.On Thursday, in a letter to shareholders, Agnelli, reaffirmed his ""commitment"" to the project and proposed ""establishing a direct link with sponsors who dare to take business risks, and control of economic resources.""On the same day, Barcelona presented their accounts and Eduard Romeu, their financial vice-president, said ""considering the Super League again would be positive.""That was followed by a Laporta interview with Sonora, reported by Marca, on Sunday.""A Super League would be an improved Champions League, with a better format, it would surely be the most attractive competition in the world,"" said the Barcelona president.However, Laporta said he would prefer not to have a closed format for the competition. ""We have to have an open Super League, where there's meritocracy,"" he said.""I think that the big clubs always playing each other would be tiring,"" he added. ""Those who like football among us, would end up tired. It's healthy and beautiful that a smaller team can beat a bigger team.""To back the underdog is very nice. You see a Euros won by Greece, and it's beautiful. And when Leicester won (the Premier League) in England it was special.""Success or failure?Opponents of the project have also spoken out.On Friday, UEFA and the European Commission announced the renewal of their cooperation agreement which ""aims to use European football as a force for positive change"" until 2025.To counter the Super League, UEFA announced a sweeping overhaul of the Champions League in May to start in 2024, with 36 teams instead of 32 and an eight-match mini-championship instead of the traditional group stage.The television rights will be sold for a projected 15 billion euros (14.6 billion dollars) for three years (2024-2027).""Sales of the new format in the US are up 150 percent. In the UK and France, not so much. It shows that the new format is very successful even before it starts,"" said Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, one of the big European clubs that was not in the initial Super League agreement.""Football must develop but in a way that respects all clubs - small, medium and large,"" added Al-Khelaifi, who is also president of the European Club Association (ECA) and vice-president of UEFA.The judicial process continues, which may be key in the conflict's ultimate resolution. The final decision is expected near the beginning of 2023."

/business/global-economy/news/us-labour-market-forges-ahead-3138451,US labour market forges ahead,"US employers hired more workers than expected in September, while the unemployment rate dropped to 3.5 per cent, pointing to a tight labour market which keeps the Federal Reserve on its aggressive monetary policy tightening campaign for a while.Though the 0.2 point decline in the jobless rate from 3.7 per cent in August was partly because of people leaving the workforce, the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed fewer Americans working part-time for economic reasons last month. The labour market continues to show resilience despite the Fed's stiff interest rate hikes.""The labour market isn't just rolling along, it's a virtual steam-roller that does nothing to slow economic demand and help the Fed in its inflation fight,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 263,000 jobs last month after rising by an unrevised 315,000 in August, the survey of establishments showed. Job growth has averaged 420,000 per month this year, down from the monthly average of 562,000 in 2021.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 250,000 job gains, with estimates ranging from as low as 127,000 to as high as 375,000. The unemployment rate was forecast unchanged at 3.7 per cent.The broad increase in employment was led by the leisure and hospitality industry, where payrolls increased by 83,000 jobs. The bulk of the gains were at restaurants and bars. Still, leisure and hospitality employment remain 1.1 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level.Healthcare added 60,000 jobs in September, returning employment in the sector back to its pre-pandemic level. Employment in the professional and business services industry increased by 46,000 jobs. Manufacturing added 22,000 jobs, while construction created 19,000 positions, despite the housing market being hammered by the higher borrowing costs.There were also gains in wholesale trade employment, but the financial activities industry shed 8,000 jobs. The transportation and warehousing sector also lost 8,000 jobs.US stocks opened lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices fell. The labour market's resilience has been attributed to a reluctance by businesses to lay off workers following difficulties hiring in the past year as the Covid-19 pandemic forced some people out of the workforce, partly due to prolonged illness caused by the virus.While government data this week showed job, openings dropped by 1.1 million, the largest decline since April 2020, to 10.1 million on the last day of August, there are still 4 million more vacancies than there are unemployed Americans. An Institute for Supply Management survey on Wednesday also showed several services industries reporting labour shortages in September.But with the headwinds from higher borrowing costs and slowing demand rising, economists expect companies will significantly pull back on hiring, with negative payrolls likely next year. Economists say businesses have been backfilling open positions as they struggled to expand headcount to match increased demand for their products, driving up job gains.The US central bank has hiked its policy rate from near-zero at the beginning of this year to the current range of 3.00 per cent to 3.25 per cent, and last month signaled more large increases were on the way this year.September's consumer price report next Thursday will also help policymakers to assess their progress in the battle against inflation ahead of their November 1-2 policy meeting.Financial markets have almost priced-in a fourth 75-basis points rate increase at that meeting, according to CME's FedWatch Tool.The household survey from the which the unemployment rate is derived showed 57,000 people left the labour force last month.As a result, the labour force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, slipped to 62.3 per cent from 62.4 per cent in August.The number of people working part time for economic reasons dropped 306,000 to 3.8 million last month.With the labour market still tight, wage gains remained solid. Average hourly earnings increased 0.3 per cent after a similar rise in August. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 5.0 per cent from 5.2 per cent in August.The Atlanta Fed's wage tracker, which controls for compositional effects like skill level, occupation and geography, is running above 6 per cent. The average workweek was unchanged at 34.5 hours for the fourth straight month."

/sports/news/unfamiliarity-the-concern-tigresses-3138296,Unfamiliarity the concern for Tigresses,"Bangladesh were completely outplayed on Saturday and suffered a heavy 59-run defeat against a fierce Indian side in a Women's Asia Cup encounter at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium.However, more concerning than the margin of defeat is the Tigresses' inability to go toe to toe with big teams like India, which was apparent by the way Nigar Sultana Joty's side faltered yesterday.""Most of the time, we play these [big] teams only during World Cups. We do not play frequent series against them. That's a problem,"" Joty said at the post-match press conference yesterday.The other game that the defending champions lost in this edition of the Asia Cup was against Pakistan. However, much of the blame for the nine-wicket thrashing in that game was attributed to a slow and unsporting track at the Sylhet ground 2.Bangladesh came into this tournament as unbeaten champions in the ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifiers, where they convincingly beat the likes of Ireland, Thailand, Scotland, and the USA.For the Tigresses, as per Joty, the problem lies in their lack of exposure against teams like India throughout the year.""The teams we play against regularly, we know about their bowlers and their strengths. So, we are doing well against those teams. If we are given the opportunity to play another game against India, we will definitely play better cricket,"" Joty added.India posted a big 160-run target and suddenly Bangladesh found themselves in an uncharted territory. Although they did not lose a wicket, the Tigresses could only muster 30 runs in the Powerplay. They played as many as 21 dots during those six overs of initial field restriction.""When chasing such a big total, the utilisation of the Powerplay remains the most important aspect. If they [the openers] could score 45 runs or around 50 runs in the Powerplay, we would not have lost by such a big margin. We could even have been in with a chance to win the game,"" Joty realised.The Tigresses' innings stopped at 100 for seven in 20 overs but they looked to be out of the contest long before that. Bangladesh have two more games to play – against Sri Lanka and the UAE – in the league stage of the tournament and winning any one of them could make the case for seeing the Tigresses progress to the semifinals.A spot in the semifinals seems all but certain for the hosts but the main headache for this Bangladesh side would be when they might face another unfamiliar opponent at the latter stage of the tournament."

/news/bangladesh/news/infrastructure-development-adb-ready-give-20b-has-concerns-3138336,Infrastructure development: ADB ready to give $20b but has concerns,"The Asian Development Bank is ready to give over $20 billion to finance Bangladesh's road and railway projects but raised concerns over the timely implementation of schemes.The Manila-based multilateral lender mentions the challenges facing implementation in a project portfolio review report submitted to the Bangladesh government last month.The report does not mention over how long the money will be disbursed.""Lack of comprehensive detailed design, including quality survey and investigation, contributes to significant scope changes, and time and cost overruns,"" it says.In some transport sector projects, appointing a contractor took over 20 months after the bidding was approved, it says, adding that the main cause of the delay was poorly prepared bidding documents.""Land acquisition and resettlement is one of the major reasons transport projects require time extensions,"" the report reads.It is taking longer for development project proposal (DPP) preparation or revision, submission of the DPP to the line ministry and approval by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), it says.The ADB presented an outline of projects in which it is likely to finance about $4.16 billion in the next three years.A decade ago, ADB's finance in the country's transport sector was $741 million. In August this year, the lender's finance in the sector was almost $3 billion, according to the report.Referring to certain projects, the ADB says approval of revised DPP took over a year causing delays in project implementation.The report cites a project titled ""Transport Connectivity Improvement Preparatory Facility"", for which the ADB approved a loan of $42 million in February, 2020.The loan agreement for the project was signed in June 2020 and the loan became effective in August that year. But no money has been spent from the fund yet. No consultants have been appointed to study the feasibility and finalise a detailed design of the project either.A $400 million fund for another project titled ""Dhaka-Sylhet Corridor Road Investment (trance 1)"", was approved by the ADB in September last year, but not a single penny has been utilised so far, the report says.Project implementation also gets delayed over complications of land acquisition and compensation to the affected individuals, it says, adding that delays also take place in selecting and deploying resettlement NGOs or consultants for those who are evicted for the project.Lack of understanding of FIDIC (International Federation of Consulting Engineers) contracts by the project management unit (PMU) or project implementation units (PIUs) staff, frequent changes of project directors, understaffed PIUs, and lack of coordination among supervision consultants and contractors delay the project implementation too.FIDIC rules are the standard forms of contract for use between employers and contractors on international construction projects.Poor supervision by consultants and repeated replacement of experts are responsible for weak contract management in many cases.Besides, the settlement of audit observations takes a long time, which results in non-compliance of financial management. Many audit observations are pending for a long time for most projects, the report observes.RECOMMENDATIONSThe ADB recommends strengthening the reviewing capacity of the implementing agencies and experts to improve the quality of project design, cost estimate, and procurement packaging.Dedicated management teams at PMUs and PIUs, who are familiar with and experienced in working with the ADB in areas that include procurement, financial management, and FIDIC contracts, should be assigned.The consultant recruitment and procurement should be streamlined.The ADB also suggests using its project readiness facility to improve design, procurement readiness and establishment of a management team.For land acquisition and resettlement, competent NGOs should be selected and the budget should be sufficient.The ministry concerned and the Planning Commission should take necessary measures to reduce the time for DPP and revised DPP or technical project proposal approval to expedite progress.To be able to meet the ADB's project readiness criteria, advanced contracting and retroactive financing may improve project readiness for approval and reduce the risk of implementation delays, it adds.The ADB has identified 16 road and railway projects the lender will finance in the next three years.The projects include Laksam-Chattogram Dual Gauge Railway Project ($300 million); Dhaka-Sylhet Corridor Road Investment Project ($500 million); Dhaka Northwest Corridor Road Project-Phase 3 ($400 million); Line 5, Southern route of Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Development Project ($300 million); Phase 1 of Dhaka-Cumilla Chord-line Project ($300 million); Phase 1 of Dhaka-South Corridor Road ($400 million); Dhaka-Chattogram PPP Highway Project ($400 million); and Phase 2 of Dhaka Northwest Corridor Road Project ($200 million)."

/news/bangladesh/news/prabarana-purnima-today-3138561,Prabarana Purnima today,"The Buddhist community will celebrate their second largest religious festival -- Prabarana Purnima -- across the country today with due solemnity.The festival is also known as Ashwini Purnima that marks conclusion of the three-month-long seclusion of the monks inside their monasteries for self-edification and atonement of their defilement.The Purnima follows a month-long preaching of sermons by Buddhist monks for the welfare of every being and the whole of humankind through a month-long yellow-robes offering ceremony that begins the day after the Purnima.According to the legend, Buddha once clipped some strands of his hair and said that if he were qualified to attain supreme wisdom and enlightenment, the strands would not fall down but go up instead – which they did in the long run.To mark this event, Buddhists will release candle-lit air balloons made of coloured paper (fanush) and set them free to flow towards the sky in the evening, which is the chief attraction of the festival.The festival will be celebrated in all monasteries, respective offices of the religious organisations and educational institutions through daylong programmes.President Abdul Hamid, in a message, conveyed greetings to the members of the Buddhist community.The programmes will herald with the hoisting of the national and religious flags atop all monasteries at dawn and chanting of the sacred verses from the sacred Tripitaka.Breaking of fasts of the monks, mass prayers, blood donation, Sangadana, discussions, panchashila and pradip puja will highlight the programmes.In the city, the main religious congregations will be held at Dharmarajika Bouddha Bihar, International Bouddha Temple, Kalachandpur Bouddha Bihar, Uttara Bouddha Bihar, Adibashi Bouddha Temple in Mirpur and Ashulia Maithree Bhabona Kendra.A number of Buddhist periodicals will be brought out on the occasion.Special prayers will be held in all monasteries seeking peace and prosperity of the nation and the world.Members of the law enforcement agencies have already been deployed in and around all temples in the city and districts for the smooth celebration of the festival. "

/opinion/views/news/churchill-and-india-manipulation-or-betrayal-3138321,Churchill and India: Manipulation or betrayal?,"History is often written by the victor, and there can be no finer examples than Winston Churchill's books on the Second World War and British imperial stories, in which he played no small role. But truth cannot be seen from only one perspective. This is why Kishan Rana's book: ""Churchill and India: Manipulation or Betrayal"" (Routledge, 2022) is such an important contribution to an emerging global history different from just Euro-centric narratives. Superbly researched, Kishan connected the dots to find that Churchill's record on India reflected part of his own limited experience with Indians, formed through his leadership of Indian Muslim troops as part of his early career, and his grand, but often self-serving, view of world affairs from imperial London.Churchill was right on the Nazi German threat but flawed on resisting India's road to independence. The Last Lion could not stop the slow but unstoppable deterioration of the British Empire, not with the emergence of the United States, which wanted no rival. In the post-Second World War period, America actively ensured that European states shed their colonies so that none would be strong enough to challenge her dominant status. American hegemony remains a classic ""divide and rule"" strategy, learnt well from the British.Kishan's book chronicles the Indian context and perspectives, which were swept aside because Britain was pre-occupied with the European war. Distant colonies cannot be defended from imperial over-reach, so India was lucky that Japan was too pre-occupied by China and stretched managing the newly conquered South-east Asia to launch any full-scale invasion of South Asia. Subra Chandra Bose's Indian Independence Army, formed from Indian soldiers captured by the Japanese in the Malayan battle (one of the biggest disasters of British military history), marked a significant turning point in the Indian road to independence.Managing huge empires has monumental consequences, much of which has been swept under the carpet until Indian historians began digging deeper into the fiascos. The 1943 famine in Bengal, in which more than 2 million Indians starved to death, happened under Churchill's watch as prime minister. The India-Pakistan split (which Churchill encouraged) resulted in the displacement of 10-20 million people and loss of life estimated between several hundreds of thousands and 2 million. The historical facts that India's GDP remained in absolute terms roughly the same at USD 1 trillion, and declined from roughly one quarter of global GDP when Britain took over to only 4 percent of world GDP at the time of independence, speak volumes about Britain's inglorious management of her glorious empire. Historian Utsha Patnaik calculated that Britain gained USD 45 trillion in today's money from her stewardship or occupation of India.Kishan has done a great service to history by meticulously judging Churchill's record. For Britain, he was a faithful, loyal, even great servant. For India, under the yoke of empire, it is not so glorious. The colonised must suffer because they must, even if the coloniser betrayed their interests. This explains why India today is ""on her own side"", rather than the side of the North Atlantic allies, in the Ukraine War. Those who preached human rights, freedom and rule-based international order were all brutal former colonisers. War and invasion rightly should be condemned. But history remembers who did the invasions first. No power comes to the present with clean hands. Lord Acton was right – there are no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests.This is a book to be savoured, and like a true detective story, it tells the tale of great men with grand vision and their seemingly small faults. Andrew Sheng is a distinguished fellow at Fung Global Institute.

/business/economy/news/2-out-3-lightweight-plastic-items-mismanaged-3138506,2 out of 3 lightweight plastic items mismanaged," Two out of three lightweight plastic items used in Bangladesh end up mismanaged, mostly due to a lack of source segregation and household collection infrastructure, said an expert yesterday. ""Waste segregation at the household level, soiled plastic, the lack of knowledge and motivation for waste pickers, health and safety hazards, and not formalising the waste plastic collection industry all act as a barrier in creating a holistic ecosystem,"" said Ijaz Hossain.The former engineering faculty dean of the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology was giving a presentation at a seminar ""Enabling Policy for Sustainable Plastic Waste Management"" at Sheraton Dhaka.The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) and Unilever Bangladesh jointly organised the event.In Bangladesh, the use of plastics has grown tremendously in recent years in line with rising per capita income and their affordability. The plastic industry's domestic sales amounted to around Tk 40,000 crore in 2021. More than two million people are employed in the industry, which consists of over 5,500 factories, said Hossain.Though the government has taken up initiatives to address waste management, most remain as laws in paper and wish lists, he said.""In order to build a sustainable ecosystem for plastic waste management, it is important to work in a multi-dimensional approach,"" he said.Hossain's recommendations include developing the plastic waste collection capability and management infrastructure, enhancing plastic waste recycling capability, formalising segregation and value-addition in waste management and formally addressing waste management by municipalities.He also urged the government to invest in technical capability development, learn from best practices and create a sustainable national policy.""We will have to find innovative and smart solutions for waste management,"" said Tazul Islam, minister for local government, rural development and cooperatives.""Moreover, waste collection is currently not considered to be sustainable as it is still not viewed as a business proposition,"" he said.""An effective solution would be to follow the circular system which ensures that the consumption of plastic does not increase and moves towards a sustainable waste management model,"" he said.""Waste management is a complex process as it has multiple industries and stakeholder involvement,"" ‍said Shahab Uddin, minister for environment, forest and climate change.""Our focus is to co-create policies that are practical and effective, in consultation with stakeholders, including brand owners, to intervene in the value chain,"" he said.""It is very common that plastic usage will increase with per capita income and gross domestic product, so the use of more plastic is a good sign for the economy,"" said FBCCI President Md Jashim Uddin.""Using more plastic is not the problem, rather, plastic waste management is the main challenge,"" he said.""One key area for intervention is mass awareness creation about waste disposal,"" he said.""If we could segregate waste at source like in developed countries by increasing the engagement of people, we would be able to implement a sustainable model for plastic waste management,"" he said.""Waste segregation at source makes waste recycling viable. We need to create awareness among mass people about how to segregate and dispose of waste and that is the biggest challenge for us,"" he added.""We have taken a few pilot projects in collaboration with city corporations,"" said Zaved Akhtar, managing director and CEO of Unilever Bangladesh.""If our voluntary initiatives do not get proper facilitation, other organisations will not be encouraged to participate,"" he said.""We must understand that one or two companies would probably not be able to solve the problem. It would require the whole business community to come forward and contribute,"" he said.The seminar was moderated by Shamia Akther, director and head of communication and partnerships of Unilever Bangladesh. "

That's not surprising, given there was a kick to the face,"" Nagelsmann told Sky.Saying the draw was ""a fair result"", Nagelsmann turned the focus on his own side, saying ""we could have closed it down, but we didn't.""Dortmund manager Edin Terzic lauded his team's ""deserved"" draw, saying ""we threw everything forward"" and ""needed every single person"" to decide the match.Bellingham finished the game as captain for the third successive week, after Mats Hummels was subbed off at halftime. "

/news/world/usa/news/world-midst-5th-wave-debt-crisis-3138476,World in midst of ‘5th  wave’ of debt crisis,"The world is facing a ""fifth wave of debt crisis,"" World Bank President David Malpass warned Friday, calling for more support for countries in distress.The pandemic forced many countries to take on more borrowing, and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have warned that many are already facing or at risk of debt distress amid soaring global inflation and rising interest rates.""I'm worried about the debt levels, worried about the individual countries,"" Malpass told reporters.""In 2022 alone, around $44 billion in debt service payments from bilateral and private debt service have become due"" in some of the poorest countries, bigger than the foreign aid flows the countries could hope for, he said.""Right now we're in the midst of what I think is a fifth wave of debt crisis.""According to the World Bank, there have been four waves of debt accumulation in the global economy since 1970, and have generally sparked financial crises in many emerging and developing economies.Speaking days before policymakers gather in Washington for the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, Malpass called for ""radically more transparency"" from creditors and borrowers on the debt levels.His comments come at a difficult time for the world economy, which is grappling with surging inflation and rising interest rates that threaten to ripple around the globe and derail nascent recoveries.Some observers have warned that aggressive interest rate hikes by major economies could trigger a global recession, but policymakers say allowing high inflation to take hold would be even worse.""It's very important, as we face these financial crises around the developing world, that we recognize the supreme importance of the advanced economies in terms of restoring growth and moving towards a faster growth environment,"" Malpass said.Developing countries also need more capital flows, and although the World Bank is expanding help for countries, it is ""simply not enough,"" he said.Last Monday, UNCTAD, the UN Conference on Trade and Development, urged central banks to loosen their belts in order to avoid a global recession, saying financial tightening risked pushing the world into grim prolonged stagnation.According to Unctad, rapidly-rising interest rates and financial tightening in advanced economies, combined with multiple crises resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine, have already turned a global slowdown into a downturn, with the desired soft landing looking unlikely.""We need to warn that we may be on the edge of a policy-induced global recession,"" Unctad Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan told a press conference in Geneva.The agency said inadequate financial support could leave developing countries exposed to the cascading crises of debt, climate shocks and pandemic recovery.However, ""there's still time to step back from the edge of recession,"" Grynspan said, adding countries ""have the tools to calm inflation and support all vulnerable groups"".""This is a matter of policy choices and political will. But the current course of action is hurting the most vulnerable, especially in developing countries, and risks tipping the world into a global recession."""

Nazim was also injured.Footage of the incident also showed that BCL Joint General Secretary Mahbub Khan, Organising Secretary Nazim Uddin, Human Resource Development Affairs Secretary Nahid Hasan, and Private University Affairs Secretary Al Amin Rahman led the attackers.Police on Friday detained 24 parishad men at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and from nearby areas in connection with the incident. Among the detainees were several people who went to the hospital for treatment of their injuries.A Dhaka court yesterday sent the 24 to jail after they were produced before the court in the case filed by Aminur, of Dhaka College BCL unit, said Assistant Public Prosecutor Hemayet Uddin Khan.The 24 were also shown arrested in the other case.Meanwhile, a group of leaders and activists of Bangladesh Gono Odhikar Parishad staged a sit-in in front of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court of Dhaka, demanding the immediate release of all the arrestees.Gonotantra Mancha, an alliance of seven bodies, in a statement condemned the BCL's attack on parishad men and demanded their release."
/star-health/news/genetically-engineered-muscle-tissue-being-developed-treat-type-2-diabetes-3138636,Genetically engineered muscle tissue being developed to treat type 2 diabetes,"Injections of genetically engineered muscle tissue hold great promisein treating type 2 diabetes (T2D), the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Stockholm, Sweden (19-23 Sept), revealed.T2D is the most common form of diabetes and is responsible for more than 1 million deaths a year, globally.Insulin resistance – where the body's cells don't respond properly to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from blood, causing blood sugar levels to rise – is a key feature of T2D.Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage the heart, eyes, feet and kidneys and shorten life expectancy by around ten years.T2D is usually treated with oral medication and lifestyle changes initially but most people will need insulin injections eventually.To find a better treatment, researchers at Levenberg Lab, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology genetically engineered muscle tissue to take up greater amounts of sugar from the blood.In previous research, the transplantation of genetically engineered muscle cells into diabetic mice improved their blood sugar levels.In their latest research, the team used the same technique to genetically modify human muscle cells.  The cells were engineered to make more insulin-activated sugar transporter (GLUT4), a protein that's known to help cells take in sugar.The cells were then grown into 3D tissue in the lab on scaffolds – matrices made from a biopolymer.Tests showed that the new tissue was able to take up 50% more sugar than normal muscle tissue.Pieces of tissue 6mm in diameter were then transplanted into diabetic mice through a small incision in the abdomen and their blood glucose levels were monitored.The transplant resulted in a reduction in blood glucose levels of around 20%.The team also developed a more flexible, sponge-like scaffold that could be injected using a syringe, removing the need for surgery.The tissue grown on the new scaffold developed normally.  Tests showed that injection did not cause significant damage to the tissue grown on the new scaffold and that the tissue could still take up sugar from the blood."
/opinion/editorial/news/chhatra-league-untouchable-3138806,Is Chhatra League untouchable?,"We are shocked at the way Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) men attacked an event organised to mark the third death anniversary of BUET student Abrar Fahad on the Dhaka University campus on Friday. Reportedly, after the attack, BCL activists again assaulted the members of Bangladesh Chhatra Odhikar Parishad – which organised the memorial event – when the latter went to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for treatment. And the police, instead of stopping the attackers or taking any action against them, detained 20 Chhatra Parishad men for interrogation. Among them were some who went to the hospital to take care of the injured! Surprisingly, Chhatra League men didn't bother to stop even there. On Saturday, they filed two cases against the members of Chhatra Odhikar Parishad and the police have already sent detained leaders and activists of the organisation to the court.These incidents speak volumes about the vicious environment in our public universities where student wings of the ruling Awami League often terrorise other student organisations as well as general students to establish their supremacy on campus. The question is, what prompted the BCL to carry out this particular attack? Is it because the event was a reminder that it was BCL leaders and activists who had beaten Abrar – a second-year student of electrical and electronic engineering – to death in 2019 and thus subjected them all to intense scrutiny? And what message did they want to convey to the students through these attacks and lawsuits? Did they want them to know that they have no right to express their opinion or organise any programme that goes against the interests of BCL?Only a few days ago, the BCL men swooped on rival Bangladesh Chhatra Dal leaders and activists on the DU campus while they were on their way to meet VC Prof Md Akhtaruzzaman. The recent happenings in Eden Mohila College have also exposed how BCL leaders carry out their seat business and extortion in public universities. Seat trade has always been a tool for them to fill their coffers and establish their dominance. Although BCL members carried out many of their atrocious activities under the very nose of the authorities, we rarely see them take any punitive/disciplinary action. Rather, on many occasions, university administrations took their side despite overwhelming evidence suggesting their involvement, which is condemnable.We urge the authorities concerned, including the police and DU administration, to take appropriate action against the BCL leaders and activists involved in the attacks on the members of Abrar Fahad Sriti Shangshad. We would also like to urge the government to expedite the process of executing the verdict on Abrar murder case after completing all the necessary procedures. Violence on campus should never be condoned or tolerated, no matter what party seal the attackers are carrying on their shoulders."
/news/world/news/n-korea-fires-2-missiles-toward-sea-after-us-s-korea-drills-3138701,N Korea fires 2 missiles toward sea after US-S Korea drills,"North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters on Sunday, the latest of a recent barrage of weapons tests, a day after it warned the redeployment of a US aircraft carrier near the Korean Peninsula was inflaming regional tensions.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that it detected two missile launches Sunday between 1:48 a.m. and 1:58 a.m. from the North's eastern coastal city of Munchon. It added that South Korea's military has boosted its surveillance posture and maintains a readiness in close coordination with the United States.Japanese Vice Defense Minister Toshiro Ino also confirmed the launches, saying Pyongyang's testing activities are ""absolutely unacceptable"" as they threaten regional and international peace and security.Ino said the weapons could be submarine-launched ballistic missiles. ""We are continuing to analyze details of the missiles, including a possibility that they might have been launched from the sea,"" Ino said.North Korea's pursuit of an ability to fire missiles from a submarine would constitute an alarming development for its rivals because it's harder to detect such launches in advance. North Korea was believed to have last tested a missile launch from a submarine in May.The South Korean and Japanese militaries assessed that the missiles flew about 350 kilometers (217 miles) and reached maximum altitudes of 90 to 100 kilometers (56 to 60 miles) before falling into the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida separately instructed officials to gather and analyze all information they could and expedite any updates about the tests to the public. His office said it also was seeking to ensure the safety of all aircraft and ships in waters around Japan while preparing for any contingencies.South Korea's presidential office said National Security Director Kim Sung-han called an emergency security meeting over the launches where members reviewed the South's defense preparedness and discussed ways to strengthen cooperation with the United States and Japan to counter the growing North Korean threats.Seoul warned that Pyongyang's consecutive provocations will deepen its international isolation and increase the ""instability of the regime"" by worsening its economy and people's livelihoods.The US Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that the launches didn't pose any immediate threat to US personnel or territory, or to its allies. But it said the launches highlight ""the destabilizing impact"" of North Korea's unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. It said US commitments to the defense of South Korea and Japan remain ""ironclad.""The launch, the North's seventh round of weapons tests in two weeks, came hours after the United States and South Korea wrapped up two days of naval drills off the Korean Peninsula's east coast.The drills involved the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and its battle group, which returned to the area after North Korea fired a powerful missile over Japan last week to protest the carrier group's previous training with South Korea."
/opinion/project-syndicate/news/why-populists-dont-concede-3137901,Why Populists Don’t Concede,"In the run-up to Brazil's presidential election, the first round of which was held on October 2, President Jair Bolsonaro crafted his own version of former US President Donald Trump's ""Big Lie"": the claim that a loss at the ballot box is fraudulent. Incumbents who adopt this tactic might simply refuse to concede, while still leaving quietly. Or, more dangerously, they can foment outrage and even incite violence by their supporters.It is no surprise that Bolsonaro, dubbed the ""Trump of the Tropics,"" would emulate Trump in this respect. Trump has demonstrated how an electoral loser can remain a powerful – even domineering – force in a country's politics. But accepting the results of elections is one of the most basic elements of democracy. If election denial is becoming a new global trend, we must ask why so many citizens would accept leaders who fraudulently cry ""fraud.""Bolsonaro is facing Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (better known as Lula), a left-wing former president who remains very popular, as demonstrated by his large and consistent lead in opinion polls as well as his narrow win in the first round of the polls. While the gap could get narrower, the far-right Bolsonaro is expected to lose. But he has spent years priming his supporters not to accept that outcome.Most ominously, Bolsonaro has sown doubt about Brazil's electronic voting system, which has been used since 2000 and is widely considered reliable and efficient. After the January 6, 2021 insurrection in Washington, DC, he warned, ""If we don't have the ballot printed in 2022, a way to audit the votes, we're going to have bigger problems than the US."" His politician son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, approvingly observed that if only the US Capitol insurrectionists had been better organised and armed, they would have succeeded.In fact, populist losers are more likely than not to cry fraud, because the entire basis of their appeal lies in the claim that they, and only they, represent ""the real people"" (or ""the silent majority""). It follows that all other contenders for power are corrupt, and that citizens who do not support the populist leader do not truly belong to the people at all, and hence are not casting legitimate votes. Populism is not just about criticising elites (which is often justified). Rather, it is a fundamentally anti-pluralist stance: populists purport to be the uniquely authoritative voice of a completely homogeneous people that they themselves have conjured up.According to this logic, if populists are the only authentic representatives of the people, an election loss must mean that someone (""liberal elites"") did something (""rigged the vote"") to thwart the will of the supposed majority. For example, after his party unexpectedly lost the 2002 general election, Hungary's current prime minister, Viktor Orbán, claimed that ""the homeland cannot be in opposition."" And after his failed bid for the Mexican presidency in 2006, Mexico's current president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, announced that ""the victory of the right is morally impossible."" After rallying ""the real people"" (that is, his own supporters) in the streets of Mexico City, he then declared himself the ""legitimate president of Mexico.""It is important to recognise how populist rhetoric erodes a country's democratic political culture even when elections do not lead to January 6-style insurrections. Populist politicians are indoctrinating their supporters never to trust the system, and always to assume that elites are manipulating outcomes behind the scenes.This is not to suggest that electoral laws and processes are above reproach. In the United States, especially, one can criticise everything from campaign finance regulations to the practical difficulties citizens face when trying to vote (many of which are the result of laws intended to make voting more difficult). But there is a difference between criticising undemocratic features of the system and declaring the entire enterprise undemocratic simply because you lost. The former could well strengthen democracy, whereas the latter is intended only to undermine it.Election denial becomes more likely when an electorate is polarised, because this creates opportunities for political entrepreneurs like Trump and Bolsonaro, neither of whom has ever been tethered to a political party. Bolsonaro has kept changing parties and, for two years of his presidency, had no party at all. And while Trump now dominates the Republican Party, he has never shown any loyalty to it (he used to be a Democrat). Both men have built up cult-like followings through social media, thereby dispensing with the need for a proper party apparatus, which used to be essential for any serious political mobilisation.Absent properly functioning parties, neither man faces anyone from the same political camp who can restrain him – and neither has an actual governing philosophy or policy programme. Both essentially stand for endless, personality-led culture war; if they had a party programme they actually cared about, they might be willing to step aside for intraparty rivals more likely to win future elections, and hence be able to implement the programme.Such figures can be expected to go for broke and deny what they know to be an actual loss. Far more consequential is how others act. Trump has succeeded in making endorsement of the Big Lie a litmus test for being a real Republican. Accordingly, a slew of Republican congressional, senatorial, and gubernatorial candidates refuse to say whether they will concede an election loss in November. In Brazil, Bolsonarismo remains a minority position, but its protagonist has been manoeuvring to get the military on his side, and he enjoys significant support among the police.What populists present as ""the silent majority"" is often a loud minority, as in the case of both Trumpisms and Bolsonaristas. And while minorities have every right to make themselves heard, it is incumbent on the actual majority not to remain silent when a minority becomes anti-democratic and violent. Jan-Werner Mueller, professor of politics at Princeton University in the US, is the author of Democracy Rules.Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2022www.project-syndicate.org

That's what we need to do in all our matches,"" said Pioli.Stefano Pioli's team are one of three on 20 points with Napoli and also Atalanta, who travel to Udinese on Sunday afternoon with the chance to claim the outright lead.Milan sit third after a dominant display which should give them some cause for optimism ahead of Tuesday night, when they try to gain revenge on Chelsea in Champions League Group E.For Juve it was yet another poor performance and result, a second league defeat of the campaign which leaves them in eighth, seven points off the pace.""I think there's little to say after a match like that,"" said Juve coach Massimilano Allegri.""We played all right in the first half and then we capitulated. There were too many basic errors.""Hernandez keyTheo Hernandez, who missed Milan's Stamford Bridge hammering, was key to Milan taking the lead.His challenge on Cuadrado led to a corner which the France full-back took, and Tomori lashed in his first goal of the season after Olivier Giroud's effort thwacked him in the chest.It was as much as Milan deserved. Rafael Leao had already struck the post twice for the hosts, and although Juve did look menacing on the break they lacked the delicate touch of suspended Angel Di Maria.Dusan Vlahovic was particularly out of sorts and it was his poor pass which led to Diaz doubling the hosts' lead eight minutes after the break.Diaz pounced on Vlahovic's lazy ball and charged up the field on a lightning run, skipping past Adrien Rabiot and Leonardo Bonucci before forcing a powerful finish past Wojciech Szczesny.Diaz was scooped up onto Leao's shoulders while the more than 70,000 fans packed into football's La Scala celebrated with the fervour of a crowd who knew they had as good as claimed the points.Juve tried to fight back as Pioli switched things up ahead of the Chelsea rematch but the best they could muster was a Moise Kean shot which was deflected for a corner.Milan would have finished even more emphatic winners had Szczesny not done well to stop a marauding Pierre Kalulu from crowning a commanding display with his first goal of the season.Dzeko doubleMilan are also five points ahead of local rivals Inter Milan, who won 2-1 at Sassuolo thanks to Edin Dzeko's brace which continued his team's rebound in form after beating Barcelona in midweek.The 36-year-old struck on the stroke of half-time to give Inter the lead at the Mapei Stadium and secured the points with 15 minutes remaining after Davide Frattesi levelled on the hour.Dzeko is now on 101 goals in Serie A, where he has played since moving to Roma from Manchester City in 2016.""Scoring is a great feeling, when the ball crosses the line you're the happiest man in the world,"" Dzeko told DAZN.""You can lose matches like the one today and that has happened to us recently. We didn't play great but we wanted to confirm what we did against Barcelona.""Inter face Barca at the Camp Nou on Wednesday night, a match which will be crucial to their chances of qualifying, after beating the Catalan giants 1-0 earlier this week.Dejan Stankovic takes charge of his first Sampdoria match later on Saturday when his winless team take on fellow strugglers Bologna trying to get off the bottom of the table."
/world/europe/news/blast-damages-key-crimea-bridge-3138351,Blast damages key Crimea bridge,"Russia yesterday said three people were killed in after a truck exploded on its bridge linking Crimea -- a symbol of its annexation of the peninsula -- without immediately blaming Ukraine.On the same day, after Moscow suffered a series of setbacks on the battlefield that triggered unprecedented criticism of its army at home, Moscow appointed a new general to lead its Ukraine offensive.The blast ripped through the 19-kilometre bridge more than seven months into Moscow's Ukraine offensive, although local authorities said it had reopened to motor traffic with vehicles subject to stringent screening. Rail traffic also resumed.Dramatic social media footage showed the bridge on fire with parts plunging into the water.Russian investigators said three people were killed and that two bodies -- a man and a woman -- were pulled out of the water after the bridge had partially collapsed.They were likely to be passengers of a car that was driving near the exploded truck and their identities were being established, Moscow said.It had also identified the owner of the truck as a resident of Russia's southern Krasnodar region, saying his place of residence was being searched.Russia said the blast -- which occurred just after 6:00am local time -- set ablaze seven oil tankers transported by train and collapsed two car lanes of the giant road and rail structure.The bridge, personally inaugurated by President Vladimir Putin in 2018, is a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine.It is hugely important to the Kremlin, and Moscow had maintained the bridge crossing was safe despite the fighting.While some in Moscow hinted at Ukrainian ""terrorism"", state media continued to call it an ""emergency situation.""Ukraine's presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak earlier took to Twitter posting a picture of a long section of the bridge half-submerged.""Crimea, the bridge, the beginning,"" he wrote.""Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled.""The Ukrainian post office announced it was preparing to print stamps showing the ""Crimean bridge -- or more precisely, what remains of it"".The Kremlin's spokesman said Putin had ordered a commission to be set up to look into the blast on the bridge which is hugely symbolic and logistically crucial for Moscow.Officials in Moscow stopped short of blaming Kyiv.But a Russian-installed official in Crimea pointed the finger at ""Ukrainian vandals."" Another in the neighbouring Kherson region said repairs could ""take two months"".And the spokeswoman of Russia's foreign ministry said that Kyiv's reaction to the blasts showed its ""terrorist nature.""Some officials in Moscow and in Russian-occupied Ukraine called for retaliation.There have been several explosions at Russian military installations in the Crimean peninsula.Authorities in Crimea appeared to downplay the blasts and tried to calm fears of food and fuel shortages in Crimea, which is fully reliant on the Russian mainland since Moscow annexed it in 2014.The blasts come after Ukraine's recent lightning territorial gains in the east and south that have undermined the Kremlin's claim that it annexed Donetsk, neighbouring Lugansk and the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.After several weeks of crushing military stbacks, Moscow yesterday announced that a new general -- Sergei Surovikin -- would take over its forces in Ukraine.The decision -- made public in an unusual move -- comes after the setbacks on the battlefield led to growing discontent among the elite towards the army's leadership.This month, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov called for a top general to be fired in Ukraine after Russian forces lost control of the key city of Lyman. Senior Russian lawmaker Andrei separately urged officers to stop ""lying"" about the situation on the battlefield.Surovikin previously led Russia's forces in southern Ukraine. He has combat experience in the 1990s conflicts in Tajikistan and Chechnya, as well as, more recently, in Syria."

He also drew attention to an action-oriented discussion on the issue of loss and damage in the upcoming COP-27, scheduled for November in Egypt.Deputy Secretary Sherman appreciated Bangladesh's leadership role in climate change and encouraged Bangladesh to join the Global Methane Pledge prior to COP27.Shahriar thanked the US government for delivering nearly 88 million Covid vaccine doses to Bangladesh, as well as the US humanitarian support to the Rohingyas and efforts to ensure repatriation of Rohingyas to Myanmar.He also urged the US government to expedite the deportation of Bangabandhu's killer Rashed Chowdhury to Bangladesh, mentioning that the issue was of utmost importance to the people of Bangladesh and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.He emphasised the conclusion of an extradition treaty between Bangladesh and US as early as possible.Sherman lauded the contribution of Bangladeshi peacekeepers in global peacekeeping, and expressed condolences for the deaths of three Bangladeshi UN peacekeepers, who were killed in the line of duty in Central African Republic on October 4.The Russia-Ukraine war and the global food and energy security were also discussed at the meeting.Later that day, Rear Admiral Eileen Laubacher, special assistant to the US president and also the incoming senior director for South Asia at the White House National Security Council, paid a courtesy call on the state minister at the Bangladesh embassy in Washington, DC."

/business/economy/news/pubali-bank-tear-3138496,Pubali Bank on a tear,"At the time of its denationalisation in 1984, Pubali Bank's defaulted loans were more than 50 per cent owing to a lack of corporate governance. The bank set out to turn around from its fragile financial health and it has not had to look back since then.Today, Pubali Bank is one of the sound financial organisations in Bangladesh and non-performing loans (NPLs) have fallen to as low as 3 per cent, way lower than the industry average of more than 8 per cent.""But it was not a smooth journey as multidimensional efforts had to be taken to improve the health,"" said Safiul Alam Khan Chowdhury, managing director of Pubali Bank Ltd.He joined the bank as a senior officer in 1983 after completing his post-graduation from the University of Dhaka.After serving it for nearly four decades, he is set to retire tomorrow, joining a small group of banking professionals who spent their entire career in a single organisation and went on to helm the pole position.In fact, Chowdhury was the one who had first-hand knowledge of how the bank was rebuilt from the scratch. In fact, he played an active role in improving the financial health of the lender.""Our main aim was to fortify the corporate governance, helping the bank become vibrant,"" said Chowdhury in an interview with The Daily Star yesterday.Capacity development and the change in the mindset of the workforce have also played a crucial role in the transition of the bank. And all contributed to the reduction of NPLs drastically.Subsequently, it came out of the list of problem banks in 2005 and the Bangladesh Bank withdrew its observer two years later.At present, Pubali Bank is the highest profit maker among conventional private commercials bank in Bangladesh.Its net profit stood at Tk 435 crore last year, up 17.4 per cent a year ago. Operating profit surged to Tk 991 crore in the first nine months of 2022, versus Tk 771 crore generated during the identical period a year ago.""We have achieved all these without compromising corporate governance,"" said Chowdhury.He cited customer satisfaction as the main driver for the bank's stellar performance year after year. Pubali Bank has placed equal importance on mobilising deposits, selecting borrowers cautiously, and facilitating exports, imports and remittance flow in order to diversify earnings.Embracing modern technologies and digital solutions has put the bank on a higher growth trajectory.ICT-based initiatives of the Bangladesh Bank, customers' expectations and demand, and rapid advancement in information and communication technology have significantly influenced the banking industry in recent years.Thus, the lender, which was established in 1959, has taken a leading role when it comes to introducing a number of banking services provided digitally.In order to take banking services to customers, it introduced an app-based banking product named ""PI Banking"" in August 2020. An e-KYC (electronic know your customer) and an instant e-KYC-based account opening system have already been rolled out.""We have invested a lot to ensure security and use big data analytics, data mining and artificial intelligence to reshape our online banking,"" Chowdhury said.According to the veteran banker, technological advancement will be the key driver for growth in the banking sector in the coming years. So, Pubali Bank has decided to rely less on cash and workforce with a view to minimising costs.He also touches upon the ongoing stress in the country's foreign exchange market, driven by US dollar shortages amid higher imports and escalated commodity costs.""The central bank has taken some good initiatives such as the restrictions on importing luxury items, increasing the margin on letters of credit, giving incentives to remitters and exporters, and fixing the exchange rate for exports and remittance.""""The country needs to reduce imports through import substitution by utilising every available resource.""Chowdhury suggested exporters search for niche markets to increase export and create their own brands.""We also need to focus on the Indian market to raise our exports and narrow the trade gap. Congenial environment for doing business has to be created to attract foreign direct investment.""During his long career, he worked as a branch manager, regional manager, division head, chairman of the credit committee of the head office and in many other positions. He was promoted to the post of managing director from additional managing director in April last year.He singled out his four-year stint as a manager of the Motijheel Corporate branch as the most challenging time for his career. At that time, the bank was categorised as a problem bank because of its high volume of NPLs.Management realised that if two branches – the Motijheel corporate branch and the foreign exchange branch -- could eliminate huge losses, the result would be enormous and shake up the bank, paving the way for it to move out of the ignominious category of the problem banks.Chowdhury was given the charge of running the Motijheel branch.""I took up the challenge because I have always believed that there exists opportunity wherever there is a challenge. I gave my 100 per cent and within a short time, the branch became profitable.""""The success generated a huge momentum for the entire bank and sowed the seed for its current growth trajectory,"" Chowdhury said.In recognition of his honesty throughout his career, the board of Pubali Bank honoured him with the Integrity Award for the last fiscal year. The central bank also recognised Pubali Bank as a sustainable lender during his time at the top.Chowdhury's parting advice for the banking industry: ""Human resources have to be developed to equip themselves for the massive technological changes going through the financial industry. Banks will also have to find ways to mitigate risks."" "
/business/global-economy/news/opec-output-cut-shows-growing-rift-between-biden-and-saudi-royals-3138386,Opec+ output cut shows growing rift between Biden and Saudi royals,"The Opec+ organisation's decision this week to cut oil production despite stiff US opposition has further strained already tense relations between President Joe Biden's White House and Saudi Arabia's royal family, once one of Washington's staunchest Middle East allies, according to interviews with about a dozen government officials and experts in Washington and the Gulf.The White House pushed hard to prevent the Opec output cut, these sources said. Biden hopes to keep US gasoline prices from spiking again ahead of midterm elections in which his Democratic party is struggling to maintain control of the US Congress. Washington also wants to limit Russia's energy revenue during the Ukraine war.The US administration lobbied Opec+ for weeks. In recent days, senior US officials from energy, foreign policy and economic teams urged their foreign counterparts to vote against an output cut, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.Amos Hochstein, Biden's top energy envoy, along with national security official Brett McGurk and the administration's special envoy to Yemen Tim Lenderking, traveled to Saudi Arabia last month to discuss energy issues, including the Opec+ decision.They failed to prevent an output cut, just as Biden did after his own July visit.US officials ""tried to position it as 'us versus Russia,'"" said one source briefed on the discussions, telling Saudi officials they needed to make a choice.That argument failed, the source said, adding that the Saudis said that if the United States wanted more oil on the markets, it should start producing more of its own.The United States is the world's No. 1 oil producer and also its top consumer, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.The Saudi government media office CIC did not respond to Reuters emailed requests for comment about the discussions.""We are concerned first and foremost with the interests of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and then the interests of the countries that trusted us and are members of Opec and the Opec + alliance,"" Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz told Saudi TV Wednesday.Opec weighs its interests with ""those of the world because we have an interest in supporting the growth of the global economy and providing energy supplies in the best way,"" he said.Washington's handling of the Iran nuclear deal and withdrawal of support for a Saudi-led coalition's offensive military operations in Yemen have upset Saudi officials, as have actions against Russia after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.A US push for a price cap on Russian oil is causing uncertainty, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Bloomberg TV after the Opec cut, noting the ""lack of details and the lack of clarity"" about how it will be implemented.A source briefed by Saudi officials said the kingdom views it as ""a non-market price-control mechanism, that could be used by a cartel of consumers against producers.""A Biden-directed sale of 180 million barrels of oil in March from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve put downward pressure on oil prices. In March, OPEC+ said it would stop using data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), a Western oil watchdog, due to Saudi-led concerns the United States had too much influence.On Thursday, Biden called the Saudi decision ""a disappointment"", adding Washington could take further action in the oil market.""Look it's clear that Opec Plus is aligning with Russia,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday. She would not elaborate on how the output cut would affect US-Saudi relations. In the US Congress, Biden's Democrats called for the withdrawal of US troops from Saudi Arabia and spoke about taking back weapons.""I thought the whole point of selling arms to the Gulf States despite their human rights abuses, nonsensical Yemen War, working against US interests in Libya, Sudan etc, was that when an international crisis came, the Gulf could choose America over Russia/China,"" Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, said on Twitter.Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel Al-Jubeir, said in remarks to Fox News on Friday when asked about the US criticism: ""Saudi Arabia does not politicize oil or oil decisions.""""With due respect, the reason you have high prices in the United States is because you have a refining shortage that has been in existence for more than 20 years,"" he added.Weeks after Biden took office as president, Washington released a report tying the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The prince, son of King Salman, 86, has denied ordering the killing but acknowledged it took place ""under my watch"".The prince became prime minister last month and his lawyers have been arguing in a US court that this makes him immune from prosecution in the Khashoggi death.Biden's trip to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in July for a Gulf summit was aimed at patching up relations, but he also levied harsh criticism of bin Salman over Khashoggi's murder.Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Saudis hope the production cuts will give Opec+ control over oil prices and ensure enough oil revenue to protect their country from a recession.""The macroeconomic risk is getting worse all the time, so they have to respond,"" Cahill said. ""They are aware that a cut will irritate Washington, but they are managing the market."""

""We are very serious so that such accidents do not happen.""He expressed displeasure over a section of the media mentioning that the media people go to foreigners to ask questions on Bangladesh's internal issues.   "

/business/economy/news/labour-migration-may-exceed-pre-covid-levels-3138511,Labour migration may exceed  pre-Covid levels,"The growing number of people from Bangladesh registering for work overseas indicates that international migration from the country may soon surpass pre-pandemic levels, according to a recent report by the World Bank.Around 600,000 locals registered for overseas employment in the first six months of this year while there was a total of 617,000 migrants in 2021.In the five-year leading up to Covid-19, the number of people from Bangladesh going abroad for work stood at an annual average of about 750,000.Besides, the recovery of international migration is somewhat stronger in Bangladesh compared to that of other South Asian countries, as per the report styled ""Coping with Shocks: Migration and the Road to Resilience"", released last Thursday.However, data on overseas work permits issued in the first half of 2022 shows that other than Bangladesh, the flow of migration from Pakistan may also surpass what it was in the pre-pandemic era.Some 400,000 people from the country registered for work abroad in this year's January-June period while the number was just 240,000 in 2021, down 63 per cent compared to an annual average of about 657,000 during the five years prior to Covid-19.Meanwhile, around 100,000 migrants from Sri Lanka had registered for overseas employment in 2021, which was more than double the number that went abroad the year before.Around 41.2 million South Asians were living outside their country of birth just before the coronavirus pandemic began in 2019, the report shows.In certain countries such as Nepal and Sri Lanka, the number of foreign job seekers is close to 10 per cent of their total population.Additionally, Bangladeshi migrant workers spent an average of more than $3,000 to move abroad before the pandemic, the report shows.It goes on to say that migration exposes South Asians to various risks because of the precarious labour market conditions that poor migrant workers face.For example, the legal (visa) status of migrants in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the most common international employment destination for South Asians, is contingent on their holding temporary jobs in low-skill sectors.Similarly, poor internal migrants in South Asia work largely in the informal sector, where they lack access to social protection.In parts of Bangladesh, approximately one-third of households out-migrate temporarily during the pre-harvest lean season.The flow of migrants represents the interaction of two economic forces: reallocation of labour to places where it is more productive, and adjustment to local economic shocks; both of which are central to inclusive and resilient development.Despite the importance of migration to individuals and the overall region, migrants in South Asia face considerable barriers to mobility.The Covid-19 crisis exposed this vulnerability on a large scale as migrants returning home during pandemic-related lockdowns faced multiple hardships.New survey-based evidence confirms that Covid-19 substantially slowed down new migration flows and created an unprecedented wave of return migration.Surveys also reveal that return migrants, especially women, struggled to assimilate into the home labour markets, resulting in high unemployment rates among the newly returned migrants.To ensure that migration can continue to play a key role in development and as a coping mechanism in the face of shocks, two policies deserve priority, the World Bank report says.First, it is vital to address unnecessarily high costs and frictions in migration, particularly those that might have worsened during the coronavirus crisis.The second main policy priority for the region is to learn from the pandemic experience and incorporate measures to ""de-risk"" migration into migration-supporting policies and institutions.In particular, because many poor migrant workers are employed in informal jobs, reforms to extend social protection to the informal sector should be designed to include migrant workers without deterring mobility."
/world/europe/news/250-pilot-whales-die-remote-new-zealand-stranding-3138491,250 pilot whales die in remote New Zealand stranding,"About 250 pilot whales have died after beaching on New Zealand's remote Chatham Island where the shark risk makes attempts to refloat them too dangerous, the government said yesterday.The pilot whales, members of the dolphin family, were reported to have been stranded Friday on the northwest of the island, New Zealand's department of conservation said.""We do not actively refloat whales on the Chatham Islands due to the risk of shark attack to both humans and the whales themselves,"" it said in a statement.A trained team euthanised surviving whales to prevent further suffering, the department said. Indigenous peoples of New Zealand and Chatham Island were present to give support, it added.""All the stranded pilot whales are now deceased and their bodies will be left to decompose naturally on site,"" the conservation department said.Such strandings are ""not uncommon"" in the Chatham Islands, off the eastern coast of New Zealand's South Island, it said, noting that the largest recorded event involved an estimated 1,000 whales in 1918.Just over two weeks ago, almost 200 whales perished on a beach in Australia's remote western Tasmania. State wildlife services managed to refloat 44 of the mammals.Scientists still do not fully understand why mass strandings occur.Some have suggested pods go off track after feeding too close to shore.Pilot whales -- which can grow to more than six metres (20 feet) long -- are also highly sociable, so they may follow pod-mates who stray into danger.In New  Zealand, around 300 animals beach themselves annually, according to official figures, and it is not unusual for groups of between 20 and 50 pilot whales to run aground.But numbers can run into the hundreds when a ""super pod"" is involved.In 2017, there was a mass stranding of almost 700 pilot whales."

We told them [DCs, SPs] they will have to work impartially during the elections.""They must not behave in a way that would make people think they are biased and not non-partisan. As public servants, they have to understand the difference between the government and a political party.""Habibul said the DCs and SPs should never consider themselves party activists.Warning the officials, the CEC said the EC will strictly monitor the activities of the field-level officials. ""Any negligence of duty will not be tolerated.""In his written speech at the closed-door meeting, Habibul said it was unfortunate that many complaints have already been lodged about violations of the electoral code of conduct during the campaigning for the October 17 zilla parishad elections.""We have received numerous complaints of intimidation and threats … We want to firmly say that if illegal interferences, intimidations, and bias are not resisted, the elections will become a farce.""According to EC officials, there was a ruckus at the meeting when Election Commissioner Anisur Rahman was talking about allegations that many officials act out of bias while discharging their duties, and also in many cases, they do not spend the allocated budget properly.Expressing disappointment, the commissioner said several officials at the meeting talked about increasing their benefits, but they said nothing about allegations raised against the way electioneering for the zilla parishad polls is going on.""There are allegations that the officials work in league with the MPs and ministers. Many, while taking part in the talks with the Election Commission, also raised the allegations of the officials' bias …. have our officials become toothless?"" an EC official quoted Anisur as saying.The commissioner alleged that magistrates do not get the budget allocated for them as fuel cost. Several DCs protested his statement, said an SP.Anisur said he had proof of this and he won't speak if the officials didn't want him to. He then asked them if he would continue speaking. As  some officials said ""no"", the commissioner stopped.After the meeting, the CEC along with three other commissioners joined a  press conference, but Anisur was not there.This correspondent went to Anisur's office around 2:30pm for his comments but found he was away. He also didn't pick up the phone and answer text messages.Many opposition political parties, including the BNP, allege that massive ballot-stuffing took place on the night before the election day in 2018. They also allege that police and local administration officials, who carried out election duties, were either involved in ballot-stuffing or looked the other way.Electoral irregularities like stamping ballots the night before the polling day and ballot-stuffing by capturing booths took place in 47 out of 50 constituencies, found a TIB survey in January 2019.Other irregularities include ""silence"" of the law enforcers and administrative officials; casting of fake votes; barring voters from going to polling stations; and forcing voters to cast votes for a specific symbol, the study said.Speaking at the meeting yesterday, Election Commissioner Brig Gen Ahsan Habib Khan (retired) also stressed the need for maintaining impartiality by the DCs and SPs.He said proceedings of the cases filed against political activists would continue. ""But all concerned should show a transparent attitude towards these matters. It should also be kept in mind that panic must not be created among the candidates or their supporters,"" Ahsan Habib added.According to EC officials, some DCs and SPs urged the commission not to use EVMs in remote areas. They said many voters are still wary of using EVM as they are not comfortable with using technology.The CEC said many officials have urged them to arrange massive campaigns and voter education on the use of EVM. ""We have plans to hold campaigns and educate voters on EVM.""Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Akter Hossain, senior secretary at the Public Security Division of the home ministry, said many officials suggested reducing the number of polling stations and increasing the number of booths instead so that enough law enforcers can be deployed to maintain law and order.He said officials would remain impartial while discharging election duties.Responding to a question, the senior secretary said the allegations of cases being filed to harass opposition activists during elections were not discussed. However, he said, there is no scope for filing such cases.An EC official said DCs and SPs proposed that there should be coordination between them and the local election officials regarding the selection of polling centres and presiding officers. They said smooth voting cannot be ensured unless the presiding officers remain impartial."
/health/news/microplastics-detected-the-1st-time-human-breast-milk-3138821,Microplastics detected for the 1st time in human breast milk,"Microplastics have been discovered for the first time in human breast milk, raising concerns among experts about the health consequences for infants.Infants are particularly sensitive to chemical pollutants, according to scientists, and further study is urgently needed.However, they emphasised that breastfeeding is still by far the best approach to nourish a baby, reports The Guardian.Breast milk samples were collected from 34 healthy mothers in Rome, Italy, a week after giving birth. Of them 75% had microplastics, reports The Guardian.Previous studies have demonstrated that microplastics are hazardous to human cell lines, lab animals, and marine species, but the impact on humans is unknown.Plastics frequently include hazardous compounds, such as phthalates, which have previously been detected in breast milk.The mothers' consumption of food and drink in plastic packaging, as well as seafood, was monitored, as was their usage of plastic-containing personal hygiene items. However, there was no link with the presence of microplastics. According to the researchers, the pervasive presence of microplastics in the environment ""makes human exposure unavoidable,"" however larger investigations in the future may reveal specific risk factors, said the report.The Italian team identified microplastics in human placentas in 2020. ""So the proof of microplastics' presence in breast milk increases our great concern for the extremely vulnerable population of infants,"" said Dr Valentina Notarstefano, at the Università Politecnica delle Marche, in Ancona, Italy.""It will be crucial to assess ways to reduce exposure to these contaminants during pregnancy and lactation,"" she said. ""But it must be stressed that the advantages of breastfeeding are much greater than the disadvantages caused by the presence of polluting microplastics. Studies like ours must not reduce breastfeeding of children, but instead raise public awareness to pressure politicians to promote laws that reduce pollution,"" Notarstefano said.Another recent study found that bottle-fed newborns are likely to consume millions of microplastics each day, and that cow's milk can include microplastics, it said.Massive amounts of plastic garbage are poured into the environment, and microplastics pollute the whole earth, from Mount Everest's top to the deepest oceans. The microscopic particles are consumed by food and water, as well as inhaled, and have been identified in the excrement of newborns and adults, it reported.The breast milk study, published in the journal Polymers, discovered microplastics made of polyethylene, PVC, and polypropylene, all of which are often found in packaging. The researchers were unable to analyse particles smaller than 2 microns in size, and smaller plastic particles are likely to exist. Plastics were not used to collect, store, or analyse the breast milk samples, and control samples were also processed to rule out contamination, the report also said.While specific microplastic risk factors were not discovered in this short study, Notarstefano said: ""We would like to advise pregnant women to pay greater attention to avoiding food and drink packaged in plastic, cosmetics and toothpastes containing microplastics, and clothes made of synthetic fabrics."""

On that day, Dhaka suffered more outages among all divisions -- 429MW.The day before, the authorities estimated that approximately five percent of the demand would have to be shed. The actual outage was more than double that of that -- 11 percent or 1,375MW.According to the load-shedding schedule released by Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited for yesterday, most places in Dhaka and parts of the suburbs covered by the company would have experienced power cuts between three and five times in 24 hours.Narayanganj's Fatullah would have experienced the most outages; about eight times in those 24 hours.Places in Azimpur, Dhanmondi, Demra, Khilgaon, Moghbazar among others would have experienced outages about five times.Some of the load-shedding were scheduled after as late as 11:00pm.In comparison, power cuts in September were less than what was experienced just this week.Data shows that last month, there were as many as 19 days with almost no load-shedding at all.On other days, the rate of shedding hovered between two and four percent of the estimated demand.It was only towards the end of the month, on September 23, 25, and 28, that load-shedding began to get more prominent, with outages over 700MW.September 1 had the highest demand for electricity (14,026MW) and no load-shedding.The current demand is 1,350MW less but the government is unable to deliver, resulting in more outages.Bangladesh Power Development Board's Member (Generation) Mohammed Ashraful Islam attributed the outages to ""caution"".""Since we experienced a trip in the grid, we are wary of the load. We are generating about 10,000 megawatts of electricity every day and aim to take it up to 12,000."""

/sports/football/news/psg-rescue-point-reims-after-ramos-sees-red-28th-time-3138681,PSG rescue point at Reims after Ramos sees red for 28th time,"Paris Saint-Germain salvaged a point with 10 men as they drew 0-0 at struggling Reims on Saturday but still increased their Ligue 1 lead after Marseille lost 2-1 at home to last-place Ajaccio.Both PSG and Marseille rested starters with an eye on midweek Champions League games and their showdown next Sunday.Marseille came a cropper, despite Dimitri Payet's 100th Ligue 1 goal. PSG escaped with a draw, despite Sergio Ramos' 28th career red card.PSG coach Christophe Galtier made five changes from the team that drew 1-1 away to Benfica in midweek and his side spent much of the first 40 minutes on the back foot.Reims pressed but struggled to create clear cut chances while PSG were dangerous on the counter-attack.Yehvann Diouf flew to his right to save a drive by Fabian Ruiz and then blocked a powerful shot from Kylian Mbappe, when the only one of the three PSG superstar strikers to start, broke clear after 33 minutes.Two minutes later, Marshall Munetsi spun in the PSG box but Gianluigi Donnarumma, the hero against Benfica in midweek, saved the low shot at full stretch.Four minutes before half time, Ramos argued himself into two quick yellow cards as PSG mobbed referee Pierre Gaillouste to protest a free kick against Marco Verratti.""It's incredible, incredible, it's starting to be too much. I don't know if there is something personal against us,"" PSG captain Marquinhos told Canal+ at half time.Reims, who had collected six red cards, comfortably the most in Ligue 1 this season, struggled to exploit their advantage.Abner Zeneli drew a sharp save from Gianluigi Donnarumma at the start of the second half but then the home team ran out of steam.Neymar came on and shot wide when clean through.The game ended with a string of fouls followed by bad-tempered confrontations as Neymar, Achraf Hakimi, who had come on in the 88th minute, and Mbappe, as well as Andrew Gravillon and Bradley Locko of Reims collected added-time yellow cards.  "
/sports/news/can-shakib-reunite-tigers-3138291,Can Shakib reunite Tigers?,"Bangladesh will be hoping for a better outcome after a 21-run defeat to Pakistan in the first game of the tri-nation series as regular skipper Shakib Al Hasan takes over the side in their clash against hosts New Zealand in Christchurch today.Shakib -- who had initially missed the photo session with the other captains on Wednesday after being delayed by two days due to 'complicacies with visa procedure' -- was 'rested' by the team management for the tournament opener against Pakistan.Led by Nurul Hasan Sohan, Bangladesh were able to restrict Pakistan to 167 for five but the Tigers were unable to grab the opportunity. Eventually, Bangladesh reached 146 for eight in 20 overs.There were questions regarding Shakib's involvement as captain, such as the need to engage with the team more, especially as they hope for a better result in the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup in Australia later this month.""Compared to the preparation we took at home and in the UAE, there is nothing wrong with playing in a franchise league. If three or four of our players had played such leagues, it would have been better for the team. But we expected Shakib to join the team in New Zealand well before the [tri-nation] series. He could sit with the team and talk, train together and play matches to try and erase whatever happened in the past and only focus on the coming days,"" Nazmul Abedeen Fahim told The Daily Star yesterday.""Maybe he maintained communication in different ways but obviously his physical presence has a different value. The players feel elevated by his presence. Let's hope he make up for it as a player and a leader. As a leader it is important to keep the morale of the team high and spend more time with the team.""Meanwhile, the Tigers think-tank continued to experiment with makeshift openers Mehedi Hasan Miraz and Sabbir Rahman, but things remain unchanged.It will be important for Shakib and the team management to ensure better planning with lingering questions over the makeshift opening pair as well as the need to form a settled playing eleven ahead of the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup later this month in Australia.""From the start of this tournament, I felt we might have given a chance to someone else in the opening position. I feel if you are not a proper batsman, it is always difficult to score consistently against such bowlers in those conditions. And if you observe closely, you can see that openers play proper cricketing shots. Many feel that T20 cricket is all about playing on the up, but that is wrong.""Obviously Miraz is very confident and that might help him play his shots but Sabbir is losing confidence. I think Liton can be a good option for the opening position since he plays well in white-ball cricket. He can open the innings with Miraz and Shakib can come in at number three. Afif Hossain can bat at number four, I have observed some changes in his batting and noticed he is trying to anchor the innings,"" he said.According to Fahim, the vulnerable opening pair and fragile lower-middle order is putting more pressure on the top and middle order.""We had two makeshift openers in Miraz and Sabbir and they have been failing. We have seen Taskin Ahmed coming in at number eight, which means we have a fragile opening and the lower order. We might feel that we are playing with seven batters but we technically have only five batters in the team,"" said Fahim.With less than a month to go until the T20 World Cup, Fahim opined the Tigers could take a lot from the ongoing tri-nation series. He added that it was too late to experiment.""We were not totally outplayed in the first game. At one point when Liton and Afif were batting, it seemed we could even win and reach that stage I think that's something positive. I am hoping the team will be more organised because it's too late to experiment,"" he concluded."

/star-health/news/loneliness-associated-double-the-risk-developing-diabetes-3138651,Loneliness associated with double the risk of developing diabetes,"A new study published in Diabetologia (the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [EASD]) finds that feelings of loneliness are linked to a significantly higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D).The research was conducted by Associate Professor Roger E. Henriksen and his colleagues at Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. As well as examining the association between loneliness and the risk of developing T2D, it looked at whether depression and insomnia play a role.A growing body of research has pointed to a link between psychological stress and an individual's risk of developing T2D. Loneliness creates a chronic and sometimes long-lasting state of distress which may activate the body's physiological stress response. While the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, this response is believed to play a central role in the development of T2D through mechanisms such as temporary insulin resistance brought on by elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol.This process also involves changes in the regulation of eating behaviour by the brain, causing an increased appetite for carbohydrates and subsequent elevated blood sugar levels. Previous studies have found an association between loneliness and unhealthy eating including higher consumption of sugary drinks and foods rich in sugars and fats.The study found that higher levels of loneliness at baseline were strongly associated with a higher risk of T2D when measured 20 years later. After adjusting for age, sex and education level they found that participants who responded 'very much' when asked whether they had felt lonely were twice as likely to develop T2D than those who did not feel lonely. Further analysis showed that this relationship was not altered by the presence of depression, sleep-onset insomnia or terminal insomnia, although the team did find evidence of a link to sleep maintenance insomnia."
