/life-living/travel/news/top-5-places-visit-sitakunda-3146841,Top 5 places to visit in Sitakunda ,"Well known for its natural beauty, Sitakunda has always been one of the major tourist spots in Bangladesh. Sitakunda is an upazila in Chattogram district hosting the first eco-park of the country. The name of the place itself — Sitakunda is rather intriguing and there are multiple myths behind the origin of the name, but that's another story!
For now, let's discuss the top 5 places you should visit if you are in Sitakunda.  Arguably the most popular place in Sitakunda and had to be number one on the list, Chandranath Hill is well known for its verdant and scenic view. More than a thousand feet in height, the top of the hill takes about an hour and half to reach and once you get there, you will find the temple. With the enchanting view of the sea on one side and the hills on the other, this is a view to savour as one of the most cherished memories. There are two ways to climb the hill and you should choose carefully and prepare before you start trekking.Sitakunda Eco-park is to the south of Sitakunda Bazar and only a few kilometres away. It is the first eco-park of Bangladesh and plays host to a wide number of flora and fauna. Hundreds of different types of flowers and trees are nursed here and as always, the vegetation will rejuvenate you with its soothing green touch. The park also offers home to a number of wild animals such as monkeys, rabbits, chimpanzees, etc. that only adds to the natural elements.Waterfalls such as 'Sohosrodhara' and 'Shuptodhara' are part of the park and if you come during rainy season, you can observe the true beauty of them.Also known as Muradpur Beach, it is one of the most attractive sea beaches in Bangladesh. Only 5 kilometres away from Sitakunda Bazar, the Muradpur Beach is a place that will make you feel things that are just indescribable. With the sea on one side, the Keora Forest on the other and the grass spread like a canvas under your feet, this place offers a view that we see in paintings. The breathing roots of the Keora trees are visible sometimes, adding a flavour to this already picture-perfect landscape.The name of this place is pretty accurate. 'Moha' (great) 'Maya' (enthralling) is the only way to describe the effects of this place. Mohamaya Lake is the second largest artificial lake in Bangladesh with an area of 11 square kilometres. Hills, rubber dam, fountains and crystal-clear water — all this together in a cocktail of absolute bliss and to top it off, you can camp and Kayak here.With the Komoldoho Waterfall as the hero of the trail, there are at least five more different waterfalls on this trail. The Komoldoho Waterfall itself is rather dangerous during rainy season because of its nature and therefore should be visited following the departure of the rainy season. Being one of the most challenging and risky trails in Sitakunda, this place makes up for it with the cathartic feeling it offers once you finish the trail.The Jhorjhori trail should not be missed and it offers a challenging route just like Komoldoho. Kumira Ghat will offer you a soothing view of the sea and a perfect place to witness the sunset in all it's glory. Horinmara trail is as interesting as the name itself. Sagolkanda Waterfall or Kamalak Jharna is getting more and more popular amongst travellers lately.
We suggest that instead of trying to fit everything in a tight schedule, slow down a bit and take your time in this place. Prepare for trekking with proper gears and supplies and try to enjoy the adventure rather than making it a chore to be finished in time.The easiest way to get to Sitakunda is by bus. There are plenty of buses departing from Dhaka to Chittagong every few minutes. Pick any transport service you are comfortable with and board a bus of Dhaka-Chittagong route. Easy as that.One might also get there by train if that is more convenient for you. Get down at Feni Railway Station. Then get to Mohipal bus station in any sort of transport and from there you can get on buses headed for Sitakunda."

/business/economy/news/towards-cashless-economy-driven-contactless-payments-3146336,Towards a cashless economy driven by contactless payments,"Bangladesh has been marching forward very fast, riding on its robust economic growth which is expected to be 6.9 per cent in FY22 and 7.1 per cent in 2023. Among other initiatives, this growth has been due to the far-sighted vision of the government's ""Digital Bangladesh"" initiative. Digital transformation and the resulting innovations have spurred growth in different sectors, opening new horizons to be explored.The financial (both banking and non-banking) sector also needs to embrace this digital revolution to inspire people to move towards a more organised digitised society, where transactions can become easier, safer and more convenient. One such innovation being embraced across the world is contactless payments, which play an instrumental role in developing a cashless society like the one Bangladesh is aspiring for and bringing with it a myriad of benefits and possibilities.If more people are encouraged to adopt contactless payments and digital transactions, it will have exponential impact. The ""National Digital Payments Roadmap 2022-2025"" states that digital payments could boost Bangladesh's annual gross domestic product (GDP) by 1.7 per cent, adding $6.2 billion to the economy each year.Dependence on cash is fraught with issues. According to the study/report titled ""Reducing the Cash Transactions"" in 2019 by Bangladesh Bank, the country has to spend Tk 9,000 crore annually because of cash dependence and requires 0.50 per cent of the country's GDP for the maintenance (cost) of printed money. Apart from the cost of handling cash itself, there are inherent problems of change, theft and hygiene to deal with.Owing to these inconveniences, contactless payments are gaining momentum globally with many macro-economic benefits as well. For customers, contactless payments significantly reduce the time needed to complete an in-store payment, resulting in faster checkout. Post-pandemic, the risk of handling cash and potential infections while transacting is also eliminated as a contactless card remains in one's hand.Paying cash or dipping/swiping a card requires more time and numerous steps, including handing it over to the seller, swiping it through point-of-sale (POS) machines and keying in a password or collecting change, vis-à-vis simply tapping the contactless card and completing the payment process within a few seconds.As it follows EMVCo security standards, tapping to pay is more reliable, secure and traceable than many other forms of payment.Like other countries, contactless payments are gaining currency in Bangladesh, especially on the back of the recent regulations allowing contactless payments on debit cards. Several financial institutions are encouraging their customers to adopt contactless payment methods, with over half a dozen banks rolling out contactless cards. At the moment, there are about 4.5 lakh contactless credit cards in circulation in the country and around 42,000 POS terminals can accept contactless payments. According to the same report of Bangladesh Bank mentioned earlier, today only 6 per cent of total transactions are handled electronically. This requires the ecosystem to come up with initiatives to inspire people, businesses, banking and non-banking financial institutions to opt for contactless payments and help develop a cashless society in the near future.It is heartening to see that Bangladesh is already embracing contactless payments. With enabling regulations and rising adoption by consumers and merchants, the growth of contactless payments and subsequently a less-cash society is going to be realised soon.The author is country manager for Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan at VISA Inc."

/business/economy/news/factories-weighed-down-weak-infrastructure-3146396,Factories weighed down  by weak infrastructure,"Some 132 small and cottage industrial units inside two estates of the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) in Sylhet have long been suffering due to the poor infrastructure and other facilities available to them.Owners of the affected industries have been reporting their grievances to the estate authorities and related government offices for decades now, yet the problems persist.The two BSCIC industrial estates in Sylhet are located at the Gotatikor and Khadimnagar areas on the outskirts of Sylhet city.During a recent visit to the Gotatikor estate, this correspondent found that the key problem for industries present is that the estate's drainage system is almost completely clogged.As a result, many low-lying areas become waterlogged during heavy rain, according to the mangers and other officials of several factories inside the estate.Meanwhile, the Khadimnagar estate is plagued by damaged and muddy roads that become submerged when it rains, as witnessed by this correspondent.Alimul Ahsan Chowdhury, managing director of Alim Industries Limited, said other than poor infrastructure and waterlogging, industries at the estates are being deprived of certain benefits owed to them.For example, Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited, a state-owned gas distribution company in Sylhet, is charging the industrial rate for gas connections even though a reduced rate for small and cottage industries is in effect.""Similarly, the Power Development Board is charging the commercial rate for electricity without providing the promised rebate,"" said Chowdhury, who is also president of the Sylhet chapter of the National Association of Small and Cottage Industries of Bangladesh.""Besides, the ongoing load-shedding is causing difficulties in production,"" he added.The managing director of Alim Industries, a leading agricultural machinery manufacturer in Bangladesh, went on to say that certain laws, especially those related to tax, are troubling industrialists.The BSCIC, Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments, Fire Service and Civil Defence, and Department of Environment have separate rules for establishing a factory.""As a result, investors at times face harassment by a few unethical officials,"" he said.Chowdhury then suggested a broader government development initiative for small and cottage industries at the BSCIC industrial estates.The BSCIC had initiated the One-Stop Service back in July 2021 to ease new investments and facilitate smooth business operations inside its industrial estates. However, the service in Sylhet seems ineffective as no concerned government offices have agreed to be a part of it yet.Tahmin Ahmed, president of the Sylhet Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), sent a letter to the Prime Minister on September 6 earlier this year, demanding a reduction in the 15 per cent VAT imposed on industries at BSCIC estates in Sylhet even though the law says it should be 4 per cent.He also demanded a new industrial estate in the region considering the high demand from existing industries as well as potential investors.Likewise, the BSCIC has been planning to establish a new industrial estate in Sylhet for years now.After selecting 165 acres of land on September 14, 2020, the BSCIC forwarded a memorandum to the additional deputy commissioner of revenue of Sylhet for further processing.M Suhel Hawladar, acting deputy general manager of the BSCIC office in Sylhet, said they are pushing the matter with higher authorities but the establishment of a new estate is still stalled on the decision over land.Regarding the poor infrastructure of existing estates, he said the BSCIC is implementing a Tk 10 crore project at Khadimnagar, where new drainage systems and roads will be constructed.Another Tk 1.3 crore has been proposed for upgrading the Gotatikor estate while an express power connection for industrial estates is being planned, Hawlader added.He then said many industries at BSCIC estates are not complying with certain regulations as they do not clear their VAT and other taxes accordingly.""40 per cent of the industries at estates are of the food industry, and most investors are from outside Sylhet as locals are not keen on industrial investment. Still, we are offering entrepreneurship development training to youths and arranging start-up loans from Karmasangsthan Bank to change the scenario,"" he added."
/news/bangladesh/elections/news/nid-card-services-should-remain-ec-say-3-ex-cecs-3146896,"NID card services should remain with EC, say 3 ex-CECs","Three former chief election commissioners (CECs) today said activities and services of national identity cards should remain with the Election Commission.Former CEC Abdur Rouf, KM Nurul Huda and Kazi Rakib Uddin Ahmed came up with the remarks while talking to reporters after a view-exchange meeting at the Election Commission this afternoon.Former CEC Abdur Rouf said there's no problem if the information of National Identity Card is at different offices. But as the Election Commission is the parent organisation, they should initiate the main NID.He said voters may face problems at the polling station if NID information does not match with the voter list. ""My point is that the base should be in EC,"" said the former CEC.Former CEC Kazi Rakib Uddin Ahmed said the NIDs were made  from the voter list. People will not want to be voters if NID does not belong with the EC.He said people are no longer that interested in being voters, rather there is more interest in getting the NID. This advantage should not be removed from here.""The EC has a very large database and it is protected. It's a good system. It should be strengthened,"" he added.Former CEC KM Nurul Huda said NID system is created by the Election Commission. If NID is in the hands of the Election Commission, the government will not face any problem. The NID is fully associated with the national election and the voter list.And if the government gives the job of issuing NID cards to any other body, the EC will face difficulty in working.On October 10, the cabinet approved in principle the draft of the National Identity Registration Act-2022 on conditions that some of its provisions would be reviewed and some sections of the existing law would be added to it unchanged."
/business/economy/stock/news/most-dse-stocks-struggle-get-buyers-3146281,Most DSE stocks struggle to get buyers,"Stocks in Bangladesh continued to drop for a fourth consecutive day yesterday as apprehensive investors continued to sell shares while most stocks were left without a buyer for most of the time. The DSEX, the benchmark index of Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), edged down 12 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 6,400.Turnover at the DSE slid 23 per cent to Tk 1,005 crore from what was the previous day.The DS30, the index comprising blue-chip companies, and the DSES, the Shariah-compliant index, both remained flat at their previous day's 2,277 and 1,406 respectively.At the DSE, 220 securities, or 60 per cent of the total listed issues, remained the same due to having a low number of buyers for most of the trading time. Another 49 issues advanced, and 100 declined at the bourse.Most stocks have become illiquid following the launching of floor prices by the BSEC, as investors believe the stock prices deserve to be lower, said a top official of a merchant bank.In July, the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) set the floor price of every stock to halt the free fall of the market indices amidst global economic uncertainties that have impacted Bangladesh's economic indicators in the last couple of months.It said the floor price would be the average of the closing prices of the five days till July 28. Looks like the floor price saved the stock index from a massive fall but this will have a negative impact on the market in the long run, he said.Big investors, especially foreign investors, do not like a stock market where the regulator intervenes in price movements, he added.If the stock index could fall freely, it would have gone up with investments of new investors after some time, he added.Dhaka stocks extended a losing streak to a fourth session amidst macroeconomic worries, said International Leasing Securities in its daily market review.""The jittery investors went on a sell-off to exit from the market for a while now as they fear deepening challenges of inflation riding on the price hike of daily necessities including foods,"" it said.The apprehensive investors preferred to hold onto cash to meet daily expenses amid rising inflation and future uncertainties, it added.Among the sectors, jute rose 3.3 per cent, food 0.5 per cent and cement 0.2 per cent sectors whereas IT dropped 2.3 per cent and paper 2.1 per cent.Based on the turnover, investors' focus was mainly on pharmaceuticals (22.3 per cent), engineering (16.5 per cent) and miscellaneous (12.4 per cent) sectors.The JMI Syringes and Medical Devices topped the gainers' list, advancing 10 per cent. Navana Pharmaceuticals, Anwar Galvanizing, Apex Foods, and Olympic Industries also rose over 7 per cent.The Peninsula Chittagong suffered the highest correction, sliding almost 13 per cent. BDCOM Online, Navana CNG, Paper Processing and Packaging, and Bangladesh Industrial Finance declined by more than 8 per cent.The Caspi, the all-share price index of Chittagong Stock Exchange, decreased 41 points, or 0.21 per cent, to end at 18,854.Of the issues that were traded on the bourse in the port city, 36 advanced, 80 declined, and 84 did not show any price movement. "
/shout/news/one-piece-film-red-imperfect-absurd-and-beautiful-3146926,"One Piece Film: Red is imperfect, absurd, and beautiful","Contains spoilers for the movie One Piece Film: Red After patiently waiting for over a year, I finally got the chance to watch One Piece Film: Red in a fully packed theatre. And I can safely say that it is, by far, the most ambitious and unique feature film in the One Piece franchise.The movie focuses largely on Uta, the world's most revered singer. She is also the daughter of Red-Haired Shanks and a childhood friend of Straw Hat Luffy. Her close affiliations with two of the biggest names in the pirating world make for a fun and light-hearted opening sequence. But as the movie progresses, Uta's true ambitions are exposed, leaving most of the larger world in dismay.The very first aspect of Film: Red that'll attract (or bore) viewers is its central musical motif. The music used in the film is not only integral to Uta, but to the movie as a whole. And it is clear that the producers left no stone unturned, as a total of seven different songs was played throughout the film, all written and sung by J-pop sensation Ado. Each of the songs represents different emotions that Uta goes through – powerful, inspiring, melancholic, and even borderline insane.One Piece Film: Red is also unique in terms of narratives and storytelling. It deviates from standard One Piece arc and film structures by focusing on a character-based drama instead of a fast-paced action plot.At the same time, the movie still retains its classic One Piece essence. It strives to be unique without missing the vintage One Piece feeling that fans have been in love with for over 25 years. This is a great strength because it makes Film: Red feel like a true canon-like experience.Additionally, one of the biggest highlights of the film is its wide cast of characters. From the very beginning, every Straw Hat pirate is seen showcasing their honed attacking abilities. For most fans, it was an emotional journey to see how far they came from where they started.Apart from the main cast, several marines, CP0 agents, and returning characters from previous story arcs end up playing major roles. Even still, the narrative managed to tie them all perfectly into the story without it seeming like unnecessary fan service. Instead, their inclusion makes for some expertly executed high-octane action.But the characters who took the crown were, undoubtedly, the Red Hair pirates. For the first time in the history of One Piece, we saw the most mysterious pirate crew in existence take the helm and showcase their absurdly overpowered abilities.Without diving into too many spoilers, their presence throughout the final act of the movie was an unbelievable adrenaline and emotional rush, leaving everyone at the edge of their seats with their hearts racing. It went above and beyond to be the most hype-inducing climax seen in a One Piece movie, which was brilliant because it perfectly sets up the emotionally vulnerable climax that follows soon after.In terms of presentation and animation, not much needs to be said, since Film: Red succeeds as the best animated One Piece film ever, without question. The fight sequences were fluid and vibrant, the use of multiple colour palettes was pure eye candy, and even the CGI was well-implemented.However, the film did have some flaws.For starters, the pacing wasn't exactly slow, but the first two acts focused mainly on expositions and world-building. Moreover, some of the musical sequences felt awkward and misplaced, focusing more on visuals unrelated to the current scene.Uta's motives and progression as a character were also somewhat peculiar. Her troubled past with her foster father, Shanks, led to her making questionable decisions that tied loosely into her character arc. The movie left much to be desired in terms of exploring Uta's personality.Despite these caveats, One Piece Film: Red was an unforgettable experience that I wouldn't trade for the world.Ayaan believes that the One Piece is real.

Marjina, Mukta and Tania Akhter ended up at state-run Chotomoni Nibash in Chattogram's Hathazari upazila many years ago. The three were so young that they never even got the chance to know their biological parents. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
In 1997, a sub-inspector brought Marjina Akhter to the institution when she was just 45-days old. Mukta, on the other hand, lost her parents at the age of four, while Tania was orphaned at the age of two after her mother passed away at Chattogram Medical College Hospital in 2003.
Never having the fortune to experience parental love, the three grew up in the care of Chotomoni Nibash staffers, along with many other children like them.



The centre is run by the government children's home under the social service department.
Residing in the institution, the three also completed their higher secondary education. Afterwards, they started working at Chattogram Maa O Shishu Hospital in Agrabad.
They are all in their mid-twenties now.



To aid the start of a new chapter in their lives, Chattogram District Administration organised a colourful wedding for the three ""daughters of the state"" in the city's Officer's Club on Thursday night.
Their grooms are also staff members at CMCH. Before the wedding, their ""Gaye Holud"" ceremony was held at Chotomoni Nibash premises, entertaining nearly 700 guests.
The ceremonies were adorned by the presence of many distinguished guests. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was also invited to the ceremony.
On behalf of the PM, Deputy Commissioner Md Mominur Rahman handed over gold ornaments, gifts and cash to the couples.
Marjina Akhter tied the knot with CMCH's office assistant Md Omar Faruq (29).
""I have no relatives. I never imagined this beautiful day will come to my life, that too, with love and affection from the people as well as the administration,"" she said.

/opinion/editorial/news/what-explains-the-delay-processing-donations-3146836,What explains the delay in processing donations?,"Can government authorities really be so inefficient and inept they can't even process much-needed medical equipment and medications they received as donations from international organisations and through various funds for months on end? Unfortunately, in Bangladesh, such a situation is not only possible but almost inevitable, given the lack of foresight, planning and coordination of concerned authorities.According to a report in Prothom Alo, donations from the various organisations has been lying in the Chittagong port for five months, which, by the admission of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) itself, is disrupting the ongoing Covid vaccination programme and malaria and worm prevention activities across the country.What is particularly astonishing is the reason cited for the delay in releasing these donations. Apparently, the DGHS needs to pay Tk 20 crore as customs duty and port fees to get these goods out – money which it does not have in its budget. While DGHS officials say that donations and essential items should get duty exemption in public interest, NBR and port authorities maintain that there are no provisions for such exemptions and that in order to waive the duty on special consideration, separate paperwork must be filed seeking permission (which has not yet been filed). As things stand now, the DGHS has reportedly asked the Finance Ministry to provide them the additional funds needed to get the goods released from the port, but is yet to resolve the issue.What we fail to understand is why it should take so long for the agencies to sort out the confusion. Is it the first time that such donations are coming into Bangladesh? It seems bizarre that there should be no established protocol or precedent for how to process them, given that over the decades the country has received billions of dollars' worth of donations in goods and equipment from different countries and global institutions. Besides, even if there is no precedent, one would expect the concerned agencies to move at a fast speed, particularly as such unnecessary delay at the port risks damaging the effectiveness of emergency health supplies. Most importantly, it sends a wrong message to our development partners about our sincerity in making use of the donations.It is unacceptable that such bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies are holding hostage important interventions serving the public. The government must revisit its policy and ensure a common understanding among all government bodies. In the meantime, we urge the concerned authorities to process the supplies with the urgency they deserve, instead of spending another few months sending letters from department to department without making any headway."

Footage of Elnaz Rekabi, 33, had shown her scaling a wall without her head covered during the Asian competition in South Korea while representing Iran, which has been swept by protests ignited by Mahsa Amini's death in morality police custody.  Citing an informed source, BBC Persian had earlier reported that friends had been unable to contact her, and there were fears for her safety. Iran's embassy in South Korea, on Twitter, denied reports about her going missing after the competition.  In a statement posted on her Instagram account, Rekabi said she was on her way back to Iran with the rest of the team. The statement said not wearing her headscarf during the competition was unintentional, adding ""there was poor scheduling and I was called to climb unpredictably""."

/news/bangladesh/news/living-load-shedding-3146291,21 Dhaka neighbourhoods: Power outages every other hour,"People living in the capital's Shyampur, Nandalalpur, Kajla or Matuail experienced load-shedding every alternate hour yesterday. There was not a single hour when at least one neighbourhood of these areas was not in the dark, with one feeder or the other going out every hour in turns.A person going to sleep at midnight had to endure four hours of load-shedding until 8:00am.This affected 21 neighbourhoods of the localities in the capital.Engineers in Shyampur's Network Operations and Customer Services office, which covers all four areas, said there are many factories in the areas and yesterday was declared an industrial holiday. Since the industries were closed, this area was not a priority for distribution.But there are factories and homes in Shyampur, which is serviced by Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC).Raju Ahmed, a cloth trader and shop owner of Alambagh in Shyampur, said his whole family squeezes into one room with a single rechargeable table fan at night to sleep.""My daughter has a two-year-old baby. She stays up all night fanning the baby by hand,"" said Raju.When this newspaper spoke to him at 7:00pm yesterday, he said there had been six hours of power outages since morning.This is the predicament of the area's residents at a time when temperatures can go up to 34 degrees Celsius in the day.""This is also hampering our business. Customers do not come to the market when there is no electricity, and we have to close shop by 8:00pm,"" he said.Dhaka division was scheduled to get 11 percent less electricity than the estimated demand of 4,419MW, and this shortfall was distributed among cities, with every single neighbourhood experiencing four hours of scheduled load-shedding during the day -- and many more hours of outages at night.Nighttime outages are mostly unscheduled, with distributors including the caveat that there may be load-shedding after midnight if needed.Schedules this week added at least an additional hour or two of load-shedding than that of last week.Some areas are bearing the brunt more than others. The residents of nearby Jurain got a better deal than Shyampur.According to yesterday's load-shedding schedule for areas under DPDC, Jurain and Postogola would have had at least six hours of load-shedding with residents getting some relief only after 2:00am.The entirety of Lalbagh saw up to five hours of load-shedding yesterday, with two of those outages happening at night. According to the schedule, residents got only four hours of uninterrupted power supply at night.Most of the areas served by the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (Desco) experienced a minimum of five hours of outages.Official Desco schedules however kept the outages limited between 9:00am and midnight -- although consumers reported regular night outages at least once every night.Some areas in Mirpur experienced six hours of load-shedding.Bikash Dewan, managing director of DPDC, said, ""We failed [to provide electricity to the customers]. We are in a miserable situation where we are not getting electricity as per the demand.""For the previous few days, we have been getting less electricity than the allotment. The shortage of 500-550MW is huge in Dhaka. We have nothing to do without conducting load-shedding in different areas for four to five hours a day,"" he added.Md Kausar Ameer Ali, managing director of Desco, in the evening said they have a shortage of around 300MW since last week. ""But today's [yesterday's] situation is good as of now as we have a shortage of 150MW.""Shameem Hasan, spokesperson of Bangladesh Power Development Board, said although the production is increasing, the demand is also increasing.""If there is rain for even half an hour, you could see a dramatic change in the gap between demand and supply. We had hoped the temperature would start dropping this month, but that did not happen."""
/daily-star-books/news/graphic-novel-the-push-and-pull-friendships-3146991,A graphic novel on the push and pull of friendships,"The last decade has seen the graphic novel take off in mainstream literary circles, moulding the depth of emotive storytelling with gorgeous, picturesque artwork. Most graphic novels, save a few such as Will Eisner's A Contract with God, have rarely been a collection of short stories. It's Not What You Thought It Would Be (Fantagraphics, 2021) is one such graphic novel saturated with a plethora of short stories around themes of friendship—the lost ones, the transitory ones, and the recovering ones—alongside ideas about the formation of the self. How does one navigate expectations, and accept the terms of a relationship between one's desires and needs? The author-illustrator, Lizzy Stewart, who teaches illustration at Goldsmiths College, conjures up a series of short, lively, and uniquely heartwarming stories that make it hard to believe that this is her debut collection. Stewart places her strong female characters and stories in a myriad of different settings which serve as the background to a flow of the conversations taking place. Intensely relatable as the reader flips the pages, the stories occur in places deeply etched into many of our memories—from rooftops to buses to benches in the park to the digital world of emails and texts.Nine incredibly jarring and vibrantly beautiful stories wrapped into one book. The stories take place in line with the ebb and flows of seeking different truths and understanding friendships and relationships with a heartfelt intensity. Each story has a unique setting to it. The first story, ""Heavy Air"", deals with a group of friends making a shelter for an injured fox in a neglected estate that ends up getting wrecked by a torrent of rainfall. ""Blush"" deals with the annals of growing up ""embarrassed to get anything right and equally embarrass[ed] to get anything wrong"", ending with the positive message of self-growth.""Dog Walk"" is an exciting story with two teenage girls frolicking from the park to a nearby roof, hoping to meet someone new and exciting. Interesting stories that harken to a time we have known and relished. ""Walking Home"" is a short story without any dialogue whatsoever; it leaves the sepia-minded artwork to do the talking in the reader's mind. ""Quiet"" is about a voice artist struggling to juggle her own needs versus the demands of her followers. ""Kindness is a noise. I wanted to make people hear kindness"", the artist says in the story. Perhaps the most heartfelt stories in the collection are ""A Quick Catch Up"" and ""The Wedding Guests"", which deal with placements and changing courses of friendship, from deep trust to the mundane to distant ones, portrayed through both in-person conversations and in digital settings. The dialogues are emotive, beguiling, and relatable. The artwork in each of the stories is relatable. Muted with shades of black, white, grey and blue—except the last story, which is filled with colours as the two characters chart their journey from dreamy childhood to the confusing phase of adulthood. The pages change from water colour images of nature and spaces to blue-ink drawn landscapes of various settings and the inhabitants in them. This is a soft, reflective collection of storytelling that touches your nerves gently, proving the tenacity and importance of friendships in our daily lives. In a banal life filled with anxieties, It's Not What You Thought It Would Be proves how, at the end of the day, we both constitute and make our own stories.Israr Hasan is a Senior Research Assistant at BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health.

It doesn't get bigger than the World Cup,"" Frappart said.Yamashita, who is two years younger than Frappart, has had a similar rise to the top of the men's game in Japan and became the first woman to referee an Asian Champions League match in 2019.She turned professional earlier this year, giving up her work as a fitness coach which she had previously continued on a part-time basis.Yamashita told AFP that refereeing at the World Cup ""is a big responsibility but I am happy to have it"", adding that she ""never imagined"" being handed such an opportunity.'Strong message' 
Indeed she only became a referee after being persuaded by a university friend, who she said ""half dragged me"" to take charge of a game for the first time.Meanwhile Mukansanga, 34, was called up for the World Cup having become the first woman to take charge of a match at the men's Africa Cup of Nations in January this year.The Rwandan once dreamt of becoming a professional basketball player but was already refereeing in the women's domestic league in her home country by the age of 20.Nevertheless, none of these six pioneers want their gender to be a talking point, and nor do they seek the limelight.""I am going to do everything I can to make sure that what is emphasised is the beauty of the football. I am not interested in power or control,"" Yamashita said in a recent interview with FIFA.com.Meanwhile Frappart, who is appreciated in France for her diplomatic style as well as her firmness, insisted: ""It is no longer about what gender you are. It is about your ability.""Despite that, the fact these women are breaking new ground in the men's game at a World Cup taking place in Qatar -- a country often criticised for its record on women's rights -- is hardly insignificant.""FIFA and the governing bodies are putting out a strong message by having women referees in these countries,"" added Frappart, who hopes to be a role model for the next generation of female officials.""I am not a feminist spokesperson but maybe this can help move things forward."""
/news/world/usa/news/china-sees-much-faster-timeline-taking-taiwan-3146566,China sees ‘much faster timeline’ on taking Taiwan,"Beijing wants to seize Taiwan ""on a much faster timeline"" than previously considered, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday, warning that President Xi Jinping was leading China in a more aggressive direction.Xi is on the cusp of securing a third five-year term at the helm of the world's most populous nation, delivering a landmark Communist Party Congress speech on Sunday that hailed his decade in power and restated his vow to one day ""reunify,"" or forcefully take, Taiwan.""We've seen a very different China emerge in recent years under Xi Jinping's leadership,"" Blinken told a forum at Stanford University with former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.""It is more repressive at home; it's more aggressive abroad. And in many instances that poses a challenge to our own interests as well as to our own values,"" he added.Blinken accused Xi of ""creating tremendous tension"" by changing the approach toward self-ruled Taiwan, which China's Communist Party has never controlled but claims as its own.He said China had made a ""fundamental decision that the status quo was no longer acceptable, and that Beijing was determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline,"" though he gave no hard estimate or date.Responding to Blinken's speech, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin accused Washington of altering its own approach to Taiwan, citing examples such as Pelosi's visit and recent arms sales.""Peacefully resolving the Taiwan issue cannot coexist with Taiwan separatism,"" Wang said.Senior US military figures have previously sounded the alarm that China has expanded its military forces to the point where it could soon have the capability to pull off an invasion of Taiwan."
/opinion/editorial/news/area-discrimination-unacceptable-during-loadshedding-3146856,Area discrimination unacceptable during loadshedding,"How are people supposed to live and do their daily work with electricity going out every alternate hour? That is exactly what the people of 21 Dhaka neighbourhoods are having to experience. According to a report by this newspaper from Wednesday, people living in the capital's Shyampur, Nandalalpur, Kajla and Matuail areas experienced load-shedding every alternate hour on Tuesday. And if that wasn't bad enough, they had to endure four hours of load-shedding between midnight and 8am, making it impossible for them to get any proper sleep.Because of this grave situation, families are having to spend their nights crammed into one room with a single rechargeable table fan. Young mothers are having to spend their nights fanning their babies by hand. And all these are happening at a time when temperatures are going up to 34 degrees Celsius during the day.Businesses are also suffering huge losses due to the regular power outages. Customers have been reluctant to visit markets when there is load-shedding. Production is being hampered tremendously, as many factories and industries rely on electricity for their production. And even though they have generators as backup, power outages are occurring so frequently that even the generators are failing to provide enough backup, leading to lost work hours.Even though there is no denying that global factors have had a big impact on our power sector, the fact remains that corruption and mismanagement are also responsible for its poor state. And it is a grave injustice that the government, instead of taking action against those responsible for such corruption and mismanagement, is making the people pay via frequent power cuts. And that, in turn, is damaging the national economy even further – as well as causing huge sufferings for ordinary people.Had the government paid proper heed to the past warnings of the experts, and taken appropriate measures, it is quite possible that we would not be in this terrible shape that we are in now. Be that as it may, even the experts have said that there is still time for the government to turn things around. However, for that, the government must now be open to taking advice from experts, and be willing to conduct its activities far more transparently, as well as hold the concerned authorities who were involved with all the irregularities in the sector to account.In the meanwhile, since right now there is no way for us to avoid load-shedding, we hope that the authorities will be far more conscious and thoughtful about how to conduct it. Load-shedding should be equally divided amongst different areas – none should get preference over others, unless they have a higher volume of schools, hospitals, and other emergency service provers. And power cuts should be avoided as much as possible at night, so that people can get some proper sleep."
/health/disease/news/900-dengue-cases-logged-day-3146256,900 dengue cases logged in a day,"At least 10,846 dengue patients were admitted to hospitals across the country in only 17 days this month, up from 9,911 in the entire month of September.Also, the number of deaths this month has gone up to 44 until yesterday morning against the previous month's figure of 34.According to the Directorate General of Health Services, three dengue patients died and 900 others were admitted to hospitals across the country in 24 hours preceding yesterday morning. This is highest figure of dengue cases recorded in a single day this year.With the latest cases, this year's total number of dengue patients rose to 26,938. Of them, 7,440 are from outside Dhaka, shows DGHS data.The 99 deaths recorded so far this year is the third highest in a single year.Fifty-five of the deaths were recorded in Dhaka, 22 in Cox's Bazar, 12 in Chattogram, five in Barishal, two in Khulna, and one each in Narsingdi, Mymensingh and Feni.Experts have called upon the city corporations to take immediate measures to kill Aedes mosquitoes, the carrier of dengue.A recent analysis of the patient data by the DGHS has revealed that the dengue infection rate is highest among people aged over 20 while the death rate is high among patients aged between 40-80 years.It also showed that most of dengue patients who died at hospitals breathed their last within three days of being admitted to hospitals.Tahmina Shirin, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), suggested taking sufficient fluids like oral saline, fruit juice, sorbet and coconut water if anyone gets fever, a major symptom of dengue.""A fever patient will continue taking fluids even after recovery as there is still a chance that theirhealth would deteriorate.""Patients need to be hospitalised when they feel nauseous, suffer from abdominal pain, breathing problems or bleeding from any parts of their body, Tahmina said.HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, said severity of dengue infections can be avoided if the cases are diagnosed at an early stage.For diagnosing dengue, a person has to undergo an NS1 test on the first day of getting fever. High fever, body pain and headache are some common symptoms of dengue, he said.A monsoon survey by the DGHS, conducted between August 11 and 23, found the presence of Aedes mosquitoes in 13.4 percent houses in Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) area and 11.75 percent homes in Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) area.A total of 1,319 households under 40 DNCC wards and 1,830 households under 58 DSCC wards were surveyed. The study also identified 13 DNCC wards and 14 DSCC wards as high-risk areas for dengue infection as the density of Aedes mosquitoes was higher in those wards.Dr Md Ekramul Haque, deputy programme manager of malaria and ATD control programme at the DGHS, said they have already sent dengue diagnostic kits to every upazila and asked all hospital authorities to arrange separate wards for patients, if necessary.Entomologist GM Saifur Rahman of National University said as short-term measures, the authorities concerned will have to conduct surveys in risky areas to find out symptomatic or mild dengue patients.They will also have to carry out intensive mosquito control operations in those areas to kill mosquitoes and build public awareness, he added.The government, as long-term initiatives, should guide the municipalities and district authorities properly, said Saifur.Prof Kabirul Bashar, an entomologist of Jahangirnagar University, said a national vector control guideline and its proper implementation is necessary to control Aedes mosquito population.A separate institute should be set up to conduct research and regularly share updates with the agencies involved in eradicating Aedes, he told The Daily Star.""The institute will carry out research on all kinds of vectors like sun fly [which spreads kala azar], bed bugs and mosquitoes.""Entomologist Manzur A Chowdhury said dengue has already become an epidemic in the country.Stressing the need for identifying the clusters of Aedes mosquitos, he said the authorities will have to collect the addresses of dengue patients for identification purposes.""They will also have to take effective measures within a 500-yard radius of the homes of dengue patients. This measure is called hotspot management,"" added Manzur."
/business/economy/opinion/news/fiscal-policy-can-help-people-rebound-cost-living-crisis-3146776,Fiscal policy can help people rebound from cost of living crisis ,"Governments confront difficult trade-offs amid sharp increases in food and energy prices. Policymakers must protect low-income families from large real income losses and ensure their access to food and energy. But they must also reduce vulnerabilities from large public debts and, in response to high inflation, maintain a tight fiscal stance so that fiscal policy does not work at cross-purposes with monetary policy.Food prices have been up by half since 2019 and supply disruptions have persisted in both food and energy markets. Higher prices threaten people's standard of living everywhere, prompting governments to introduce a variety of fiscal measures, including price subsidies, tax cuts, and cash transfers. We estimate the median fiscal cost of such measures at 0.6 per cent of national gross domestic product, on top of pre-existing subsidies, among countries for which estimates were available.Most governments face further pressure on public finances already strained by the pandemic. Rising inflation, weakening currencies, and climbing interest rates have led to surging credit spreads in many countries and higher interest expense going forward. Global public debt is projected to remain elevated at 91 per cent of GDP in 2022—after receding from a historic high in 2020—and remains about 7.5 percentage points higher than prepandemic levels.Low-income countries are particularly vulnerable: nearly 60 per cent of the poorest economies are in debt distress or at high risk of it.In our latest Fiscal Monitor, we discuss how policymakers can approach these trade-offs, helping people bounce back from the current crisis and better cope with future challenges.Food and energy responseFacing high debt levels and rising borrowing costs, policymakers should prioritise targeted support through social safety nets to the most vulnerable people. In some countries, this might entail providing discounts on utility bills (for basic usage) to vulnerable low- and middle-income families. Allowing energy prices to adjust is crucial to preserving broader incentives to curb energy use and increase supply. Faced with long-lasting supply shocks and broad-based inflation, governments should not attempt to limit price increases through price controls, subsidies, or tax cuts. Such a move would be costly to budgets and ultimately ineffective. With limited resources, many low-income countries will need greater global efforts in humanitarian assistance and emergency financing.In a time of high inflation, policies to address high food and energy prices should not add to aggregate demand. Demand pressures force central banks to raise interest rates even higher, making it more expensive to service government debt. A tightening fiscal stance sends a powerful signal that policymakers are aligned in their fight against inflation.Fostering economic resilienceOur report highlights that governments need to build resilience over time to a range of adverse shocks. The pandemic and the global financial crisis, beyond country-specific natural disasters and other adverse events, have shown that governments must prepare for rainy days.Building fiscal buffers gradually would eventually allow policymakers to respond swiftly and flexibly to crises.Several fiscal tools that have proved useful during the pandemic can be made part of a more permanent toolkit, depending on countries' capacity and available fiscal space. Job-retention schemes, for example, proved effective during the pandemic by stabilising more than 40 per cent of individual income loss in the European Union. Exceptional financial support to companies can prevent widespread bankruptcies. But such support should be reserved for severe crises as it exposes governments to sizable fiscal risks.More generally, social safety nets help people bounce back from unemployment, sickness, or poverty, making them more resilient to a broad set of challenges. Such systems can be made readily scalable and better targeted with the help of digital technology.We have seen how major global crises during the past decade-and-a-half have led to innovative and forceful fiscal responses, against the backdrop of rising debt and constrained monetary policy.Countries should rethink the role of fiscal policy in a shock-prone era—how it can better buffer against losses during crises and build resilience—and learn from experiences across the world.The authors all work at the International Monetary Fund"

/chattogram/news/the-many-legends-karnaphuli-3146476,The many legends of Karnaphuli,"The river Karnaphuli is considered to be what holds the port city, ie the life of Chattogram.Originating in the Lushai hills in India's Mizoram, the river travels through 270km of Chattogram Hill Tracts and Chattogram district before falling into the Bay of Bengal.At a time when road and bridge communications were not up to the standard for Chattogram city, the Karnaphuli played a pivotal role in transporting people and commercial goods by boats.After the construction of a railway bridge over the river in Kalurghat area in 1931 -- which was later converted into a rail and road bridge in 1962 -- it connected the city with southern upazilas of the district as well as other districts, including Bandarban and Cox's Bazar.Later, two other bridges were constructed over the river in Chaktai area in 1990 and 2010 respectively.There are two legends about the naming of the Karnaphuli. One of them can be found in the book ""A Fly on the Wheel"" by Thomas Herbert Lewin, which suggests the ancient name of the river was ""Kaincha Khal"".Once a prince and a princess were enjoying a moonlit boat ride on the Kaincha Khal. They were admiring the beauty of the full moon when the flower tucked in her hair by the prince fell into the water.The grief-stricken princess immediately jumped into the river to retrieve the flower. Unfortunately, she was carried away by the fast-flowing current and vanished.The prince dived into the river to rescue her but failed. Out of sorrow, he drowned himself in the river to unite with the princess in the afterlife. That is how the name Karnaphuli came to be -- ""karnaphul"", meaning the flower adorning the ear.There have been several pieces of literature -- both prose and poetry -- based on these legends. According to another legend, a beautiful highland princess, along with her friends, went to take a bath in the Kaincha Khal. After diving into the water, the princess discovered that her ""Karnaphul"" was lost.She had to give up after multiple attempts to find it. After a few days, she passed away due to illness, although it was widely believed that what killed her was her attachment to the lost piece of jewellery.Yet another legend tells a different story altogether.During the eighth and ninth centuries, Arab merchants used to bring ""Karanphol"" (cloves) to Chattogram Port from the hilly areas of Kamarup and Sylhet to export those to Europe. Once, an Arab merchant was bringing ""Karanphol"" by boat through the river.However, the boat capsized on the way, and eventually, the river came to know as Karnaphuli. "

The enemy is deliberately striking infrastructure and residential buildings in Kherson.""Russian forces in Kherson have been driven back by 20-30 km (13-20 miles) in the last few weeks and are at risk of being pinned against the western bank of the 2,200-kilometre-long Dnipro river that bisects Ukraine.Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russian-installed council governing Zaporizhzhia, also in Ukraine's south, said Kyiv's forces had intensified their overnight shelling of Russian-held Enerhodar - the town where many of the employees of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station live.Artillery fire had hit the town's outskirts and there had been 10 strikes around the local thermal power station, he said on the Telegram messaging app on Wednesday.
Reuters could not independently verify battlefield reports.Both Ukraine and Russia have denied targeting civilians, although Kyiv has accused Moscow's forces of war crimes.Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered what he calls a ""special military operation"" on February 24 because he said he wanted to ensure Russian security and protect Russian-speakers in Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies accuse Moscow of an unprovoked war to grab territory from its pro-Western neighbour.Russian troop positions in Kupiansk and Lyman in eastern Ukraine and the area between Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih in Kherson province were cited by Surovikin as under continuous attack.He appeared to concede that there was a danger of Ukrainian forces advancing towards the city of Kherson, which lies near the mouth of the Dnipro on the west bank. Russia captured the city in the early days of the invasion and it remains the only major Ukrainian city that Moscow's forces have seized intact.Kherson, one of four partially-occupied Ukrainian provinces that Russia claims to have annexed, controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnipro.After staging what Moscow called referendums in September, which Kyiv and Western governments denounced as illegal, Putin proclaimed the eastern Ukrainian border provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk - together known as Donbas - as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as full-fledged regions of Russia.Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed Kherson region chief, said the risk of attack by Ukrainian forces had led to a decision to evacuate some civilians from four towns.""The Ukrainian side is building up forces for a large-scale offensive,"" Saldo said in a video statement. The Russian military was preparing to repel the offensive, he said, and ""where the military operates, there is no place for civilians"".Last week, Russia unleashed the biggest wave of missile strikes against Ukraine since the start of the invasion.Putin cast the air strikes using missiles and drones as revenge for an explosion that damaged Russia's bridge to Crimea.Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the explosion but celebrated it.Ukraine has invited United Nations experts to inspect what it says are downed Iranian-origin drones used by Russia in violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution, according to a letter seen by Reuters.Russia's dependence on Iranian-made drones exposes Russia as ""bankrupt in military and political terms"", President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Tuesday night video address.Ukraine accuses Russia of using Iran-made Shahed-136 ""kamikaze drones"". Iran denies supplying them and on Tuesday the Kremlin also denied using them.However, two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats told Reuters that Tehran had promised to provide Russia with more drones and surface-to-surface missiles.Russia has destroyed almost a third of Ukraine's power stations in the past week, Zelenskiy said.Russia had targeted more than 10 regions in the past 24 hours, Zelenskiy said in his address, urging Ukrainians to cut back on electricity consumption in the evenings."

/news/bangladesh/politics/news/govt-losing-control-over-everything-3146301,Govt losing control over everything,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina repeatedly talks about a possible famine in the country next year because her government is losing control over everything, including the administration, for corruption and mismanagement, alleged the BNP.""The government had announced only recently that the country was self-sufficient in food. What has happened now for which it fears a food crisis? Why is she [Hasina] making such comments? It is not clear to us where the issue lies,"" said BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir.He made the comments yesterday after holding talks with the National Democratic Party (NDP) and the Jamiat Ulama-e Islam at BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office.The government is failing to tackle massive corruption that has engulfed every sector. Extreme load-shedding that people have been experiencing in recent times is also a result of corruption, said the BNP leader.In such a situation, he wondered, how the government would spend Tk 8,000 crore to purchase EVMs to hold a staged election and Tk 43 crore to construct houses for the cabinet secretary and the principal secretary.""What do you expect from this regime? …This regime has completely failed to run the state,"" said Fakhrul.Mentioning that the government used police to file ""false cases"" against 437 BNP leaders and activists in Mymensingh, he said, the authorities should remember that none can stay in power resorting to suppression, repression, killing, firing, and enforced disappearance.DEMO ON THURSDAYThe BNP has called in a countrywide demonstration on Thursday protesting police attacks on the partymen, their arrests and harassment with ""false cases"".BNP Senior Joint General Secretary Ruhul Kabir Rizvi announced the protest at a press briefing at the party's Nayapaltan central office yesterday.As part of the protest, Rizvi said, all the partymen in divisional cities, including Dhaka, and districts will hold rallies and stage demonstration on the day.He also said that Khulna division will not be a part of the countrywide protest as the party would hold a public rally in Khulna city on Saturday."
/news/world/news/iran-pledges-more-drones-missiles-russia-3146461,"Iran pledges more drones, missiles to Russia","Iran has promised to provide Russia with surface to surface missiles, in addition to more drones, two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats told Reuters, a move that is likely to infuriate the United States and other Western powers.A deal was agreed on Oct. 6 when Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber, two senior officials from Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards and an official from the Supreme National Security Council visited Moscow for talks with Russia about the delivery of the weapons.""The Russians had asked for more drones and those Iranian ballistic missiles with improved accuracy, particularly the Fateh and Zolfaghar missiles family,"" said one of the Iranian diplomats, who was briefed about the trip.A Western official briefed on the matter confirmed it, saying there was an agreement in place between Iran and Russia to provide surface-to-surface short range ballistic missiles, including the Zolfaghar.One of the drones Iran agreed to supply is the Shahed-136, a delta-winged weapon used as a ""kamikaze"" air-to-surface attack aircraft. It carries a small warhead that explodes on impact.Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar are Iranian short-range surface to surface ballistic missiles capable of striking targets at distances of between 300 km and 700 km (186 and 435 miles).The Iranian diplomat rejected assertions by Western officials that such transfers breach a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution.""Where they are being used is not the seller's issue. We do not take sides in the Ukraine crisis like the West. We want an end to the crisis through diplomatic means,"" the diplomat said.Ukraine has reported a spate of Russian attacks using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in recent weeks. Iran's foreign ministry on Tuesday dismissed as baseless reports of Iran supplying drones and other weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, while the Kremlin on Tuesday denied its forces had used Iranian drones to attack Ukraine.Asked if Russia had used Iranian drones in its campaign in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin did not have any information about their use.""Russian equipment with Russian nomenclature is used,"" he said. ""All further questions should be directed to the Defence Ministry.""The ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.The appearance of Iranian missiles in addition to drones in Moscow's arsenal in the war with Ukraine would raise tensions between Iran and the United States and other Western powers.SHIPMENT 'SOON, VERY SOON'The U.S. State Department assessed that Iranian drones were used on Monday in a morning rush hour attack on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, a U.S. official said. White House spokesperson Karinne Jean-Pierre also accused Tehran of lying when it said Iranian drones are not being used by Russia in Ukraine.A European diplomat said it was his country's assessment that Russia was finding it more difficult to produce weaponry for itself given the sanctions on its industrial sector and so was turning to imports from partners like Iran and North Korea.""Drones and missiles are a logical next step,"" said the European diplomat.Asked about sales of Iranian surface-to-surface missiles to Russia, a senior U.S. military official said: ""I don't have anything to provide at this time in terms of whether or not that is accurate at this point.""Chafing under Western economic sanctions, Iran's rulers are keen to strengthen strategic ties to Russia against an emerging, U.S.-backed Gulf Arab-Israeli bloc that could shift the Middle East balance of power further away from the Islamic Republic.The top commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami said last month some of the ""world's major powers"" are willing to purchase military and defence equipment from Iran.Rahim Safavi, a military adviser to Iran's Supreme leader, was reported by state media on Tuesday as saying that 22 countries want to buy Iranian drones.Iran's rulers are also under pressure from nationwide demonstrations which were ignited by the death in custody of a 22-year-old woman detained for ""inappropriate attire"".Several European Union states on Monday called for sanctions on Iran over its supply of drones to Russia, as the bloc agreed a separate set of sanctions over Tehran's crackdown on unrest.""They (Russians) wanted to buy hundreds of our missiles, even mid-range ones, but we told them that we can ship soon a few hundred of their demanded Zolfaghar and Fateh 110 short-range, surface to surface missiles,"" said one of the security officials.""I cannot give you the exact time, but soon, very soon those will be shipped in 2 to three shipments.""An Eastern European official tracking Russia's weapons activity said it was their understanding that this arms deal was happening, although he had no specific evidence to back it up. The official said that a decision had been taken by the Iranian and Russian leaders to proceed with the transfer.Moscow had specifically asked for surface to surface short-range Fateh 110 and Zolfaghar missiles, and the shipment will happen in a maximum of 10 days, said another Iranian diplomat.ATTACK DRONESThe stakes are high for Iran, which has been negotiating with Western states to revive a 2015 deal that would ease sanctions on Tehran in return for limits on its nuclear work.The talks have deadlocked, and any disputes between Tehran and Western powers over arms sales to Russia or Iran's crackdown on the unrest could weaken efforts to seal an accord.The United States agrees with British and French assessments that Iran supplying drones to Russia would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the 2015 deal, U.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said on Monday.The Western official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter, said that like the drones, missile transfers would also violate U.N. resolution 2231.Several senior Iranian officials are outraged about ""unjust"" planned sanctions on Iran over its arms shipments to Russia, said the second diplomat.In September, Tehran had refused a request by President Vladimir Putin for the supply of Iran's sophisticated Arash 2 long-range attack drones, three Iranian officials told Reuters.When asked the reason for the refusal, one of the officials cited several issues including ""some technical problems"".""Also the (Revolutionary) Guards' commanders were worried that if Russia uses this Arash 2 drone in Ukraine, Americans may have access to our technology."""

This study also revealed where digital gaps remain,"" said Rostrup.""The need to understand these gaps is becoming more important to policymakers, businesses, and individuals alike. Insights from this study can thus act as a map of where to bridge the widest digital divides,"" he said.Yasir Azman, CEO of Grameenphone, said he was glad to see that their efforts were paying off as connectivity has been instrumental in ensuring equal opportunities for all.""We hope the ongoing digitalisation and innovation leads to a sustainable and better tomorrow,"" he said."

/life-living/news/the-art-tolerance-dhaka-3146796,The art of tolerance in Dhaka,"Each country in the world teaches its dwellers different things. Parisians are all about romance. The Italians are master chefs, the Indians know how to bargain, and the Bangladeshis know — you guessed it — the art of tolerance.Some say that living in Dhaka is not easy and for those who have lived here for years, nothing is easy. In fact, living in this city makes it easier to tolerate any other inconvenience with a hair-flip. Someone spat inches away from your feet? Tolerate. It landed on you? Wipe and move on. The world might have a fancy word like noise pollution for needlessly honking cars but we know it for what it really is — soothing white noise that one could even fall asleep to. Which happens often, during the long respites the city graciously bestows on us to and from work every day without fail. We lovingly call them traffic jams.In a city where basic manners are a luxury and common sense is quite uncommon, you will find famous car app drivers unable to read a map, who will assure you of coming to you and then promptly proceed to cancelling the ride, and who will watch more YouTube on their phones than the road ahead. Of course, you are in safe hands because they all have 5-star ratings. They may casually hit a rickshaw or two, but that is easily fixed with a glare and an occasional fist fight. The passengers can read a book or have a snack while the drivers sort it out.Did you know that foot-over bridges in Dhaka can be used to show off the city's state-of-the-art infrastructure and you may be fined for actually using it and spoiling its beauty? No? It's sure to be there in some rulebook or another, or possibly in those little books the traffic wardens carry with them. Zebra crossings are used as road graffiti and they actually look quite cool. Often faded, these signs are largely ignored by drivers — in fact, it's much better to go for street art or alpona designs if catching their attention is the goal.Load shedding has been a nostalgic trip down the memory lane, where one would sit by candlelight and sing songs with the family or go down to socialise with friends and neighbours. Of course, in this day and age, one does not know their neighbours and the concept of joint families has all but diminished. But that does not mean these hours of heat and dimmed lights should count for nothing. In fact, they offer the best opportunity to go and study under street lights!Living in Dhaka is a janky rollercoaster ride; you must ignore the stench and the lawlessness on the streets, and the unending traffic, and instead, pick out the romance in it in the form of street side phuchkas, rickshaw rides in the rain, and shopping at absolute bargain prices at Nurjahan Market. Love it or loathe it, one can never ignore the addiction that is Dhaka city!"
/entertainment/tv-film/news/i-want-see-myself-film-director-the-future-shahnoor-3146976,I want to see myself as a film director in the future: Shahnoor,"Debuting in 1999, Dhallywood actress Shahnoor has had a long acting career, accruing 78 films to her name. She first caught the attention of the audience with her performance in Suchonda's critically acclaimed movie ""Hajar Bochor Dhore"", which was released in 2005. Her film ""Boshonto Bikel"" is currently awaiting its release on October 21.Recently, she debuted as an assistant director on the government-funded film ""Ahare Jibon"", directed by Chotku Ahmed. Shahnoor currently has her hands full, juggling the roles of an actress, assistant director and organising secretary of the Bangladesh Film Artistes' Association.In a candid conversation with The Daily Star, the actress opened up about her recent ventures and career plans.Tell us about your shooting experience on the acclaimed film ""Hajar Bochor Dhore""?It was wonderful and one of the most memorable experiences of my career. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Zahir Raihan, which is also one of my favourite novels. When Suchonda madame decided to make the film and take me in the role of Ambia, I felt extremely lucky.I put my heart into this character. Even to this day, I can recall shooting for the film while having a very high fever. There was also a huge crowd spectating the shooting. Even now, the audience still refers to me as Ambia. Your film ""Boshonto Bikel"" will be released this Friday. Can you share your feelings about the film?
In ""Boshonto Bikel"", I shared the screen with Omar Sani. The film is directed by Rafique Sikder. I want to urge the audience to watch the film in theatres with their friends and family. 



You are assisting renowned director Chotku Ahmed in the film ""Ahare Jibon"". How has the experience been for you?
Every artiste has their own dreams and goals. I have been acting for a long time in film industry, but I had always wanted to direct a film as well. So, I decided to assist Chotku Ahmed on ""Ahare Jibon"" so that I could better learn the process of directing a film, that too from one of the most experienced and tenured directors in the industry. In the future, I want to see myself as a film director.
At the same time, I am also working as an assistant director on the film ""Bela Obela"", based on the novel by Rabindranath Tagore. I will also be acting in this film.
 








You are the organising secretary of the Bangladesh Film Artistes' Association. What have you contributed to the association thus far?
It has not even been a year since I took on this role. In the last few months, we have done some good work. The artistes are well aware of the work we have done for them. Apart from this, I have personally talked to artistes and tried to provide them assistance whenever I can. I have personally helped ""Dhaka 86"" famed actress Ranjita and am trying my best to serve our artistes.
When you decided to become an actress, was your family on board with your choice?
 








My father was a military doctor and a freedom fighter. From an early age, I began to learn singing and dancing from my mother. So, my family has always supported me in my dreams and career choices.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/can-the-rock-steady-the-dc-universe-black-adam-3146571,Can the Rock steady the DC universe with ‘Black Adam’?,"In Hollywood's superhero era thus far, there has been one particularly conspicuous absence: While a parade of big-name actors have taken their turns donning various spandex suits, Dwayne Johnson — arguably the biggest movie star in the world — has, until now, sat out the trend.The Rock didn't really need a cape to prove his powers. The 6-foot-5 260-pound actor was, in many respects, already a superhero in his own right: a skyscraper-climbing hulk, a shape-shifting demi-god, even a bulked-up tooth fairy.""I was always ready and open to playing a superhero,"" Johnson said in a recent interview. ""But it had to be right and it had to feel right. I had been approached before in the past about playing a few superheroes that, ultimately, I ended up passing on. They ended up going to the right actors to play them. I just waited.""The fates have finally aligned in ""Black Adam,"" a debut so seamless that it could be called redundant. When Johnson was first trying on Black Adam's suit, he had the muscle padding removed.Johnson's entry to the superhero business comes at a crucial juncture for the DC Extended Universe, which has been plagued of late by scandal and misfires. Ezra Miller, star of the upcoming ""The Flash,"" has been arrested twice this year amid reports of troubling behavior (in August, Miller sought treatment for what he described as mental health issues ). ""Batgirl,"" a $90 million movie completed for HBO Max, was summarily axed, prompting an outcry over its atypical cancellation.Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has promised a ""reset"" to the studio's DC operations in an overhaul to implement a more Marvel-like 10-year structure and improve quality. At the fulcrum of these two eras sits ""Black Adam,"" which opens in theaters Thursday.Amid such turmoil, it certainly doesn't hurt to be welcoming in a movie star as popular as Johnson, who has 341 million followers on Instagram and is often forced to deflect questions about a possible presidential run. But just how much stability can The Rock bring to DC?""I think the timing is actually perfect. What an opportunity we have,"" Johnson said. ""I have been saying for almost years now that the hierarchy of power in the DC universe is about to change.""Before Johnson, not many saw Black Adam as such an axis-tilting force. The character, an ancient Egyptian created by Otto Binder and C.C. Beck, first appeared in a 1945 issue of Fawcett Comics' ""In DC Comics"" and has generally been portrayed as a supervillain and foe to Captain Marvel (not the Brie Larson one).More recent treatments have pushed Black Adam more toward antihero status, something the film, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (""Jungle Cruise""), extends. Black Adam, summoned to modern day, is depicted as a reluctant hero who fears his own powers.In one telling scene, Black Adam stops for a moment to watch a television with Clint Eastwood as the Man With No Name — an antihero model for Black Adam.""He has been my inspiration from day one. My favorite actor and certainly one of my favorite directors,"" Johnson said. ""I'm happy to call Clint a buddy. That was my way of paying homage to him.""How Black Adam would be introduced to movie audiences wasn't always clear. Initially, Captain Marvel, also known as Shazam, and Black Adam were to debut in a movie together. After the scripting stage, Johnson and others felt the combined launch did a disservice to Black Adam.""We did have a template for a really good idea, but ultimately both characters required so much space to properly launch them,"" said producer Hiram Garcia. ""We were just struggling in terms of bandwidth that the script could hold and in terms of tone, as well. Inherently, as you saw with how the 'Shazam' movie came out, that movie is just so differently tonally from how 'Black Adam' is.""""Shazam!"" starring Zachary Levi, was a goofy, well-received body-swap hit, grossing $366 million worldwide in 2019 (a sequel is due out in March). The ambitions for ""Black Adam"" are larger.The film, made with a budget roughly twice that of ""Shazam!"" also introduces the Justice Society of America, a superhero team of Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell).""I always felt like it was a matter of convincing our studio partners to try to look beyond the Justice League,"" Johnson said. ""I love the Justice League. But when you look past them, you open up the DC bible. There are so many cool characters you can tap into.""It's been a long haul to develop the film, tailor the part to Johnson and shoot the movie around COVID-19 delays. Johnson was first announced to play Black Adam way back in 2014.""Easy and this process have not gone together,"" Garcia said.But the filmmakers were committed to giving Black Adam the proper launch.""If Dwayne Johnson's going to do a superhero, the powers better be A-plus,"" said producer Beau Flynn.Superhero films aren't often described as a ""passion project"" but it's how Johnson talks about ""Black Adam."" He speaks about the character's previously low profile like an underdog.""No one gave him a shot,"" he said. Unlike many of the best-known comic-book characters, Johnson is not taking on this role secondhand.""No other actors had stepped into the boots of Black Adam,"" said Johnson who professes a deep connection with the character. ""I'm a very direct talker. Black Adam is very direct with his thoughts, too. The difference is: Black Adam will slap some people around. I might slap some people around but I'll do it with a smile.""As of this summer, Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy are running Warner Bros.′ revamped film division, though no new DC leader has yet been appointed. Zaslav has been seeking his studio's answer to Marvel's Kevin Feige to take the reigns. For Johnson, ""Black Adam"" is part of that new chapter for DC.""I think you're feeling this sense of urgency and the sense of excitement,"" said Johnson. ""This has been a great convergence of 'Black Adam' coming out and new leadership.""Tracking reports have suggested that Johnson, 50, could be headed for his biggest opening weekend ever at the box office with ""Black Adam."" But sounding a little like his WWE wrestler, Johnson is also eyeing his next opponent. Black Adam, he believes, is a lesser power to no superhero. He's gunning for Superman.""For five years, the most powerful and unstoppable force in the entire superhero universe has been idle on the sidelines. All that had to come to a new end,"" says Johnson. ""This is what I mean with this new era in the DC universe. Let's get that hero off the sidelines and on the big screen.""The article was written by Jake Coyle.

The number of Bangladeshi people living in New York City doubled between 2010 and 2020, according to city data.Shahana Hanif is the first Muslim woman to be elected to the City Council.

In 2016, local community leaders expressed their concerns about deportations in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential victory.Local community groups sang and celebrated the co-naming, which has been a long time coming, according to former council member Brad Lander.Local children sang and spoke about the importance of their heritage and the co-naming as they and their families waved American and Bangladeshi flags.The co-naming solidifies the street as a permanent home for the local Bangladeshi community, Hanif said.The co-naming also recognizes the struggles Bangladeshi immigrants faced traveling to and establishing their lives in Brooklyn, Hanif said, and empowers them to keep fighting and advocating for themselves in the city.""This street is a permanent part of this community for generations to witness our contributions and legacy and our love for Kensington,"" she said."

An additional $50 billion is required to end acute food insecurity over the next 12 months.The global food crisis has been partially made worse by the growing number of food trade restrictions put in place by countries with the goal of increasing domestic supply and reducing prices.Following the start of the war in Ukraine, trade-related policies imposed by countries have surged. As of October 10, some 21 countries have implemented 26 food export bans, and eight have implemented 12 export-limiting measures, said the WB.After some brief relief in the summer of 2022, fertilizer prices are beginning to rise again. In addition to increasing energy prices, policy measures such as export restrictions have limited global fertiliser availability."

/environment/news/dhaka-list-20-most-unsustainable-megacities-3146661,Dhaka in list of 20 most unsustainable megacities,"Dhaka is one of the 20 most unsustainable megacities in the world, as per a new climate report.The report titled, ""Ecological Threat Report (ETR)"", released Wednesday (October 19, 2022) found that South Asia is home to eight of the world's 20 most unsustainable megacities, with half of them in India alone.Produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), featuring exclusive research from the Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll, the Ecological Threat Report tracks the links between climate-change, ecological threats, and violent conflict or forced migration each year.Dhaka, Lahore, Kolkata, Delhi, Karachi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad are eight of the 20 cities facing the highest population growth and worst vulnerability to ecological threats.Bangladesh has seen 254 natural disasters respectively since 1981, according to the report.Many South Asian countries and cities exemplify the challenge of managing growing populations and ecological threats.For example, Dhaka, a city of 22.6 million people, is affected by ecological changes in several ways. It floods regularly, it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, and the city struggles to deal with waste, said the Ecological Threat Report.As per the report, Delhi suffered the highest air pollution of these cities. Air pollution was responsible for economic losses totalling USD 8.1 trillion, or 6.1 per cent of global economic output. While India is the world's third largest polluter, only 38.8% of its population consider climate change to be a serious threat.At least 56% countries and territories (127 out of 228) monitored by the ETR are facing catastrophic ecological threats. Europe is predicted to see high levels of water stress over next 20 years, with increased water stress predicted in Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Portugal and the Netherlands, amongst others.The countries most vulnerable to ecological threat are clustered in the three least peaceful regions: sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East & North Africa (MENA), and South Asia.In 2021, almost 92% of the world's undernourished people lived in low to very low peace countries, said the report. Megacities in low peace countries, like Kinshasa and Nairobi, have the highest population growth rates, low coping capacities, and will struggle to manage ecological threats. The world's 40 least peaceful countries will increase their population by 1.3 billion by 2050, representing 49% of the world's population.Forty-one countries are currently facing severe food insecurity, impacting economic development, public health, and social harmony, with 830 million people at risk, with 89% residing in sub-Saharan-Africa, followed by MENA with 49 million. Food insecurity is connected to water stress, defined as ""when more than 20% of the population do not have access to clean drinking water"".At least 23 out of 27 hotspot countries facing climate catastrophes with extremely low societal resilience are clustered in sub-Saharan Africa, said the report.The report's main overall finding is that the degradation of resources leads to violence and violence leads to the degradation of resources, according to the press release."

/news/bangladesh/news/forced-retirement-signal-admin-and-police-3146271,Forced retirement: A signal to admin and police?,"The government yesterday sent three superintendents of police into retirement, citing public interests, two days after it showed the information secretary the door on the same grounds.Highly placed sources in the government said the three were forced into retirement as part of a possible purge in the administration and police, keeping in mind the next general election.The three are Delwar Hossain Mia and Mirza Abdullahel Baqui of the Criminal Investigation Department and Shahidullah Chowdhury of Police Headquarters.Delwar was supposed to retire on June 4, 2026; Shahidullah on December 31, 2023; and Baqui on February 28, 2023.The home ministry yesterday issued three circulars signed by Akhter Hossain, senior secretary of its Public Security Division. All invoked section 45 of Bangladesh Service Rules, 2018.According to the section, upon the president's approval, the government can send an employee, who has completed 25 years of service, into retirement in public interest, without showing any specific reason.The government has already made a list of bureaucrats and police officials who, it perceives, are not ""aligned to the ruling Awami League's ideology"", and many of them might be forced into retirement in phases, the sources added.These officials had been in the administration and the police during the last two national polls, but the government did not bother much then. This time, it does not want them around, given the anti-incumbent mood stemming from worries over the state of economy and the power crisis, said the sources .The government is now closely watching the reaction of its decisions. Once it is convinced repercussions won't be that severe, it will go full throttle, said the sources.Of the three SPs, Shahidullah Chowdhury and Delwar Hossain are from the 12th BCS.Delwar got his promotion as an SP after 21 years of service, whereas at least three of his batchmates are working as additional inspector general of police, the second highest post in the force.At least two of Baqui's 15th BCS batchmates now hold the rank of additional IGP.Talking to The Daily Star, Baqui and Delwar said they knew nothing about why they had been let go.""I came to know about the order unofficially … I haven't yet been told of any reason,"" Baqui said as The Daily Star contacted him for his comments.Asked about his alleged links with a political party, Baqui said there is no scope for being involved in politics while in civil service.Delwar told The Daily Star he had nothing to say. ""I got a promotion after 21 long years of my service, and now I am having to go [four years] before my service life was to end.""According to sources in the police, the three were sent into retirement due to their alleged links with the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami.The police sources also said at least two officials of the ranks of deputy inspector general and additional DIG might lose their jobs.They added that this move by the government is designed to send a signal to other officials.The developments over the last three days have caused discomfort among many bureaucrats and police officials who were recruited during the BNP-Jamaat tenures.After the forced retirement of the information secretary, whispers pervade the Secretariat, but none would make any comments in public.Even Bangladesh Administrative Service Association, an organisation of civil bureaucrats, didn't issue any formal statement after Information Secretary Mokbul Hossain's force retirement."

/opinion/views/chintito-1995/news/lackadaisical-lifestyle-hardly-liberty-3146801,Lackadaisical lifestyle is hardly liberty,"Mask usage has come down to five percent, my guess, well below the rate of infection. That is the case in the big cities. In towns and villages, you are a man out of touch with history. Covid was here almost three years ago, man!One stand-up comedian explained how he left the city because no one was bothered about wearing a mask. Worried and frustrated, he travelled to his village, where he found the situation even worse. As evening fell, deeply concerned as he was, he took interest in a man, wearing a mask, standing in the distance. When he went closer, the stranger said in a thick voice, ""Hands up!""The mouth gear works well if one is desirous of concealing one's ID. Or, conversely, it provides an excuse to squirm out of a situation when you clearly could not identify a friend (in a mask) whom you are meeting after a long time. So, you blame it on the mask, until he unmasks, and you realise you were right the first time.The few who still wear the mask have various reasons. They are at the highpoint of individual awareness, or are following strict workplace rules. A few others have gotten so used to wearing one that it has now become a habit.Masks, as with all products, soon became a business commodity. They started appearing in various models and colours, some useless against the virus. Designer masks developed into a symbol of prestige in the corporate world. Almost any organisation worth its CEO had an exclusive mask with its logo stamped on the face. This location for branding was unthinkable before Covid.The mask that amused me most was worn by an elderly male Indian politician, which had bloated red lips drawn where his lips were. Besides appearing like a character from a circus, he looked unrecognisable except for his portly body that gave him away.Then there was the mask with a hole for a cigarette so that the ""health-conscious nagorik"" could carry on with his habit while others could very well die around him. This is a rude definition of self-liberty.No mask, no service. No mask, no entry. After a while these were relaxed until they became a joke, as the service providers themselves weren't wearing any. Either the authority forgot to remove the signage from the office/shop front, or are saving on the cost of a new one in anticipation of a recurrence of the pandemic in the near future.Reminded on a lift about the mandatory government mask instruction in force, an unmasked one kept quiet until he reached his floor. While exiting in a huff, he said for all to hear, ""It would be good for this country if five lakh people died"". I assume he did not include his own corpse in the count.In my workplace, I launched the practice of No mask, no salaam. It works well with those who are aware about my pronouncement, but to the uninformed you are being snooty, because not replying to a salaam is considered impolite. Ironically, most of them don their mask when they enter my office, or hurriedly so when we come across each other elsewhere.In the hay days of masking, a number of positive behavioural patterns had emerged. Spitting on the road had reduced. Swearing in public had significantly decreased. Paan chewers cut down their habit for fear of smudging their face cover.While we are not out of the woods, the government should use the media outlets more to convey its position on mask protection. Although the rate of infection is now below 10, the numbers have fluctuated. We have been here before, only to rise to 30 in a few weeks.We all want to be free from the shackles of authoritative codes even if it means endangering ourselves, our families and entire communities. We are doing it on the road and the railway, on riverine vessels, in running so-called hospitals and diagnostic centres, in disposing waste, in killing our waterways, through noise pollution...In every call, let us all abide by the respective protocols and proprieties. ""To save mankind"" sounds like a cliche. Rather, let us say, we shall do our best to save ourselves, and our immediate family. That should cover the entire humanity.Dr Nizamuddin Ahmed is an architect and a professor, a Commonwealth scholar and a fellow, Woodbadger scout leader, Baden-Powell fellow, and a Major Donor Rotarian."

/news/world/uk/news/uk-pm-sorry-economic-mistakes-3146491,UK PM ‘sorry’ for economic ‘mistakes’,"Embattled UK Prime Minister Liz Truss apologised for going ""too far too fast"" with reforms that triggered economic turmoil, but vowed to remain leader despite a series of humiliating climbdowns.""I do want to accept responsibility and say sorry for the mistakes that have been made... we went too far and too fast,"" she told the BBC on Monday.However, she said that she was ""completely committed to delivering for this country"" despite questions over who was now in control of government policy.She is set to face parliament today for a session of Prime Minister's Questions.Her government on Monday axed almost all of its debt-fuelled tax cuts unveiled last month to avert fresh market chaos.The shock move by new finance chief Jeremy Hunt -- parachuted into the job on Friday to replace sacked Kwasi Kwarteng -- leaves Truss's position in a precarious state, with Conservative MP Roger Gale saying that Hunt was ""de facto prime minister"".Hunt estimated the tax changes would raise about £32 billion ($36 billion) per year, after economists estimated the government faced a £60-billion black hole. He also warned of tough spending cuts.The chancellor of the exchequer said no government could control markets -- but stressed his action would give certainty over public finances and help secure growth.""The prime minister and I agreed yesterday to reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the growth plan three weeks ago,"" Hunt told parliament, flanked by a grim-faced Truss.The chancellor also announced the formation of an economic advisory council, featuring four experts outside of government.Hours earlier, he had used a brief televised statement to announce the dramatic reversals to nervous markets, conceding last month's budget from his predecessor had harmed the public purse.Truss told the BBC that she still believed in a ""high-growth, low-tax economy"", but that economic stability was ""my priority as prime minister"".Hunt scrapped plans to axe the lowest rate of income tax, and curbed the government's flagship energy price freeze -- pulling the plug in April instead of late 2024.After April, his department will ""review"" its energy support package, he said.A proposed reduction in shareholder dividend tax was also binned, along with planned tax-free shopping for tourists and a freeze on alcohol duty."

/sports/sports-special/t20-world-cup-2022/news/four-wicket-joseph-helps-west-indies-topple-zimbabwe-3146906,Four-wicket Joseph helps West Indies topple Zimbabwe ,"A fiery four-wicket spell from pace bowler Alzarri Joseph helped the two-time champion West Indies storm past Zimbabwe by 31 runs to keep their Twenty20 World Cup dreams alive on Wednesday.After being shocked by Scotland in their opening match on Monday, they had no margin for error if they wanted to stay in the hunt for a place in the Super 12 stage.They accomplished the feat with 10 balls to spare, dismissing Zimbabwe for 122 after setting them 154 to win.The dangerous Joseph was instrumental, taking 4-16 while Jason Holder chipped in with 3-12.The victory means they meet Ireland on Friday with the winner going through to the next round when the big guns join the tournament, while Zimbabwe face Scotland in a winner-takes-all tie.Skipper Nicholas Pooran won the toss and opted to bat against a Zimbabwe side without captain Craig Ervine, who suffered a ""mild asthmatic attack"" before the game.They were aggressive early on, but paid the price with Kyle Mayers (13) top-edging Blessing Muzarabani to wicketkeeper Regis Chakabva, who was deputising as skipper.Johnson Charles found his groove and unleashed in the ninth over, hitting 6-4-4 off Ryan Burl to get the scoreboard moving before Evin Lewis mistimed a heave down the ground off Sikandar Raza and was caught.Pooran fell for seven and when Charles was comically run out for 45 in a mix-up with Rovman Powell, the West Indies were reeling.Zimbabwe kept the pressure on. Raza trapped Shamarah Brooks lbw, and then caught and bowled Holder with the West Indies losing four wickets for 11 runs in 12 balls to leave them on 101-6.Powell (28) and Akeal Hosein (23 not out) steadied the ship and threw the bat in a late flourish to ensure they set a competitive target.In reply, Zimbabwe slammed 18 in a nightmare first over from Mayers.Undeterred, the Caribbean side made a breakthrough in the third over when Regis Chakabva dragged the ball onto his stumps off Joseph.Joseph took his second with a lightning delivery to remove Tony Munyonga and Sean Williams fell two balls later as the pressure began building for Zimbabwe.Allrounder Raza slammed 82 off 48 balls in Zimbabwe's first match on Monday, but he was out for 14 and when Joseph came back in the attack he shattered the stumps of Richard Ngarava and Luke Jongwe to end any hope they had.

/business/economy/news/9-sectors-hold-70pc-bad-loans-3146451,9 sectors hold  70pc bad loans,"Around 70 per cent of default loans in the banking sector is concentrated in nine sectors of the economy as many borrowers are finding it difficult to pay instalments for the dragging economic slowdown while willful defaulters are also a major factor.  The nine sectors are ship-building and ship-breaking, small and medium enterprises, leather, trade, textile, readymade garment, transport, credit card, and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs).Non-performing loans in the sectors stood at Tk 71,030 crore in December out of a total default loan of Tk 101,935 crore, according to the Financial Stability Report released by the Bangladesh Bank on Monday.The business slowdown stemming from the coronavirus pandemic along with the ongoing economic crisis has hurt the borrowers in the nine sectors. In addition, banks also gave out loans without following corporate governance, pushing up NPLs.As of December, banks disbursed funds to the tune of Tk 20,236 crore to the ship-building and ship-breaking industry. Of the sum, 18.87 per cent has turned bad.Banks gave out loans generously to the ship-building and ship-breaking industry in 2005-2006 as local yards won eye-catching export orders, according to Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank.Existing companies pumped hundreds of crores of taka into expanding their footprint. New shipbuilders also sprang up. But it received a major blow after the financial crisis of 2007-08 hit hard the developed economies, bringing the industry to its knees and forcing many buyers to cancel orders.As a result, borrowers in the segment have been unable to repay the loans.Although the BB has relaxed rules on loan repayment from time to time for the shipbuilding sector, it has not turned around yet.The export of ships, boats and floating structures was only $0.24 million in the last fiscal year, the lowest in a decade, data from the Export Promotion Bureau showed. The shipbreaking industry is also not doing well.Just 45 of the 158 shipbreaking yards in Chattogram are currently operational. Many shipbreaking yards are suffering losses this year as they had to count high costs for the hike in US dollar prices amid the depreciation of the taka.Emranul Huq, managing director of Dhaka Bank, says willful defaulters have mainly brought woes for the ship-breaking sector, the second-largest in the world after India in 2022.Meanwhile, the cost of scrap vessels escalated in the global market, creating a major problem for the local yards.In December, the default loans in the SME sector accounted for 13.14 per cent of the total funds disbursed by banks.""Businesses in the sector usually face various challenges. The coronavirus pandemic has compounded those challenges,"" said Rahman.""So, some banks are slowing down the disbursement of the loans going to the sector.""Of the Tk 255,943 crore extended to the trade and commerce sector as loans, 10.84 per cent have become bad.Banks extended credit support, also known as commercial loans, to traders to meet the financing requirement for their day-to-day operations and facilitate imports.Rahman says the price fluctuation in the global market has created a difficult condition for businesses, the key reason for the concentration of default loans in the sector.Credit card users were responsible for 7.77 per cent of the credit extended by banks going sour. Credit card loans totalled Tk 7,078 crore.A BB official says that many credit card holders are struggling to survive amid the cost-of-living crisis, driven by higher consumer prices.Like in most countries, inflation has been rising for months in Bangladesh for a record surge in import bills, piling up pressures on consumers.""The existing economic stress has seen the living standard deteriorate. And many cardholders are unable to repay loans on time,"" said the central banker.Some non-bank financial institutions have also failed to repay loans to banks.Some 7.39 per cent of the total loans of Tk 7,297 crore given by banks to NBFIs have turned into bad debts.A good number of NBFIs have faced a wide range of scams in recent years and their loans to borrowers have turned into NPLs. So, their strength to repay depositors, which include banks, has eroded significantly.Another major reason behind the concentration of default loans in the nine sectors is the tendency among many lenders to breach rules while disbursing credits.Of the Tk 12,18,850 crore loans in the entire banking sector, the overall ratio of default loans stood at 8.36 per cent in December."

/tech-startup/news/the-bangladeshi-team-grabbed-awards-open-world-astronomy-olympiad-2022-3147021,The Bangladeshi team that grabbed awards at Open World Astronomy Olympiad 2022,"Team Bangladesh from the Bangladesh Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (BDOAA) won 1 silver and 5 bronze medals in the 1st Open World Astronomy Olympiad (2022), a prestigious international astronomy olympiad held in Saransk, Russia, from September 26 to October 2, 2022. The competition aimed to support astronomical education and talented schoolchildren and strengthen international academic ties.This year, the silver medal winner of the competition was Hritom Sarker Oyon (Adamjee Cantonment Public School) from Bangladesh. There were also five bronze medal winners from Bangladesh as well: Imdadullah Raji (Notre Dame College), Ahnaf Anwar Nafi (Chattogram College), Radh Chowdhury (Dhaka Residential Model College), Faiyaz Siddiquee (DPS STS School) and Md Faijul Kabir Jishan (Ananda Mohan College). The team leaders of this event were Fahim Rajit Hossain, Md Mahmudunnobe and Md Arman Hassan along with one observer Turja Roy. Fahim Rajit Hossain, Team Leader of the OWAO Bangladesh Team, shared the details of their rigorous process of selecting and training the team. Each year, the BDOAA team hosts an annual BDOAA in Bangladesh, from which the top-ranking individuals are chosen for the national camp. After that, the team was selected for the International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) in multiple phases. The silver medal winner competitor, Hritom Sarker Oyon, shared his love for data analysis and theoretical problem-solving. Regarding his placement in this international competition, he said, ""Representing your nation on the world stage to bring glory is no less than a dream come true."" Oyon regularly practises problem solving at home and with his team members. This passion to solve problems pushed him higher. This year, the OWAO team was chosen from numerous tests among individuals who made it to the final phase of the national camp. The winning team members share a love to solve problems as well as a profound interest in critical thinking. All of that together, according to the team, made them interested in taking part in the olympiads of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Previously, the selected team in the IOAA has won bronze medals and honourable mentions at previous iterations of the competition. The national team exclusively competed at the IOAA because that was the only major competition. Starting this year, the OWAO is being hosted to accommodate more participation at the International level. Many national teams participated this year, including but not limited to Russia, China, Belarus, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Moldova. Radh Chowdhury, a bronze medal-winning team member, had a thrilling experience at the event. For him, the most exciting round was the observation round. He said, ""Seeing various sky maps and finding the patterns of constellations and from that star's position, missing or added stars, was really fun."" He further noted that his future plan is to keep on studying astronomy and astrophysics, and hopefully win a medal attending IOAA 2023 for Bangladesh. The competition was held in four rounds: theoretical, practical, observational, and express test. These rounds are designed to examine the competitors regarding astronomical theoretical knowledge, problem-solving, data analysis, and more. In the theoretical round, the team was given eight theoretical questions to be solved in 5 hours. Upon solving them, the contestants were to submit the scanned answers on the official OWAO portal. There was an additional 30 minutes to do this. In practice rounds, the team was given large data sets for processing analysis within a limited time frame that they had to upload to the portal again. Because the competition was held in person, teams were given photos to share observations on instead of using a telescope. Finally, in the express test round, contestants were given many short questions that needed to be answered quickly. Typically, these are a string of minor questions that need to be answered efficiently. This year the Olympiad was held remotely and the exams were supervised via video surveillance. This competition was organised by The Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation, The Government of the Republic of Mordovia, Ogarev Mordovia State University, Mira Educational Center and Former Russian Team Leaders at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA).Despite the international-level achievement, the team shared that they face many structural challenges, mainly owing to astronomy and astrophysics not being widely supported in the country. However, regardless of such obstacles, the team has higher hopes to bring future glory to the nation and are working hard towards it. "

Efforts are being made to criminalise this issue,"" said Telecommunications Minister Issa Zarepour.""It is not in the field of my duties and naturally relevant institutions should follow this up,"" he said on state television after a cabinet meeting.Iranian media outlets reported last year that lawmakers were working on a draft bill that could further restrict internet access.The bill calls for ""organising social media"" and the banning of VPN software used widely to bypass internet restrictions and blocks imposed on social media platforms, Etemad newspaper wrote in June 2021.The text also calls for jail terms for any one found guilty of violating the terms of the bill if it becomes law, according to the reformist daily.Internet users had expressed concern over the draft bill proposed by some conservative lawmakers, who have had a parliamentary majority since 2020.The recently imposed restrictions include blocking access to Instagram and WhatsApp -- until now the last remaining unfiltered social media services, in addition to clamping down on apps like the Google Play Store, as well as VPNs.Zarepour cautioned Iranians against using anti-filtering software as they risk causing ""vulnerabilities"" on the devices.""The use of the so-called anti-filtering tools or VPNs for devices such as laptops, computers, and mobile phones will definitely lead to serious vulnerabilities because it facilitates hackers' access,"" he said.""As an expert, I recommend the dear people not to use these tools as much as possible,"" he added.Zarepour was slapped with sanctions for overseeing internet curbs by the European Union on Monday in a foreign ministerial meeting in Luxemburg."

/life-living/travel/news/7-most-beautiful-temples-around-the-world-3146871,7 most beautiful temples around the world,"Temples have historically played a vital part in not only the fabric of many religions but also the livelihoods of communities, dating back to the dawn of civilization. These amazing buildings are safe places for people who want to grow spiritually or learn more about a certain religion. Ancient and revered temples are both reminders of a region's past and towering examples of its traditional architectural styles. Whether it's an all-white, quirky temple in Thailand or a Doric sanctuary above Athens, these stunning temples are worth a visit on your next trip.The Bửu Long Pagoda offers a tranquil and spiritual getaway from the hustle and bustle of Ho Chi Minh City. At the centre of the complex is the intricately carved Gotama Cetiya Stupa, which holds the famous encased relics of the Buddha as well as small pearl and crystal beads that are thought to have come from the bones of his most enlightened students and teachers. When people first arrive, they see a large turquoise pool and a grand staircase with dragon designs.The 24 pillared chambers and 1,444 columns of this magnificent temple in Ranakpur, considered one of the holiest locations in Jainism, are entirely hand-carved from amber stone. According to local legend, a Jain businessman began building the temple in the 15th century after having a supernatural vision. Each pillar tells a different story, with unique creatures and designs etched within the delicate masonry.The Temple of Heaven is a beautiful tower outside the Forbidden City. It was built in the early 1500s, when the Yongle emperor was in charge. The beautiful building was where the rulers of the Ming and Qing dynasties prayed every year for good harvests and forgiveness. Each of the colourful pillars inside the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests has its own story or symbol. Some of them show the four seasons, while others talk about the sun. Together, they show the 28 Mansions of the Moon, which are important in Chinese astrology.The Shwedagon Pagoda, which is high above Yangon and shines in the sun, maybe the oldest Buddhist pagoda or temple in the world. According to local mythology, two brothers came across the Buddha one day beneath a tree and brought him food. The Buddha, thrilled by their offer, gave them exactly eight of his tresses, which the brothers then brought to what is now Myanmar in a ruby casket. The King of Yangon then commissioned the building of the gold-plated and gemstone-encrusted shrine where the holy hairs would eventually be entombed. The pagoda has survived a number of natural disasters and military occupations, and its bright look is still a sign of hope and strength.Every flamboyant high gable, elegant finial, and grandiose hall of Bangkok's most famous temple is entirely made of Italian Carrara marble, earning it the moniker ""Marble Temple."" Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs, the half-brother of King Chulalongkorn the Great, began planning the temple in 1899, and the enormous complex, which features more than 52 Buddha statues on pillars and stained-glass windows with pictures of Thai angels, was completed over the next 11 years.The ""Tiger's Nest,"" perched on a rocky cliff in Bhutan's Paro Valley, got its name from an 18th-century story about Buddhist scholar Padmasambhava coming to the meditation place on a flying tiger. After that, he is said to have spent three years meditating in a mountain cave, bringing wonders to the surrounding lands and Buddhism to Bhutan. To get to the edge of the cliff, people have to climb up a very steep trail for two hours.Seiganto-ji is a temple that dates back to the 4th century. It is near Japan's largest waterfall and in the beautiful woods of Nachi. Temple records say that Ragy Shnin, an Indian monk, found the waterfall when he was looking for a good place to practice asceticism. Shnin is claimed to have come to Shnin at the waterfall's base and inspired him to construct the shrine. Seiganto-ji is now the first destination on the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, which takes visitors to 33 Buddhist temples in Japan's Kansai area."
/news/bangladesh/news/honorarium-doing-the-bare-minimum-3146551,‘Honorarium for doing the bare minimum’,"Pretty much every year, teachers and administrators of Jahangirnagar University (JU) distribute a huge amount of money among themselves as honorariums for ""extra services"", like preparing for and invigilating the admission tests.After looking into the distribution for the 2019-20 academic session, University Grants Commission said the distribution ""needed to be more logical"".Moreover, it mentioned that such tasks are part of the duties of JU's teachers and administrators.The commission did not investigate other sessions, as it was only instructed to probe this one, said Abu Taher, a member of UGC.From sources, The Daily Star has found details of the ordered honorariums, approved by the university's syndicate and finance committee, for the last five years.As per the order, for the 2020-21 admission test, former vice chancellor Farzana Islam was set to receive Tk 2.86 lakh. Two pro-vice chancellors and the treasurer were to receive Tk 2.81 lakh each. Tk 1.38 lakh was supposed to be given to each teacher who performed the duty. Officers related to the admission test were to receive Tk 69,000 each.For 2019-20, the VC was set to get Tk 3.40 lakh; two pro-VCs and treasurer Tk 3.35 lakh each; Teachers Tk 1.65 lakh each; and officers Tk 82,500 each. Overall, around Tk 12.63 crore of honorariums were supposed to be distributed that year.In 2017-18 session, teachers were to receive Tk 1.4 lakh each. The Daily Star only found a part of that academic year's information. A document shows that the authorities allocated Tk 1 lakh for a portion of the VC's honorarium.Similarly huge amounts were distributed in the other three academic years. According to the financial documents, honorariums are given for two services, performing separate duties during the admission test and being a member of the central admission test's governing body.The money is determined based on the amount of work done, like the number of shifts completed or participation in meetings.This system is not a part of any overarching law. It is the university's own practice. Moreover, in some years, in the name of ""dignity"", the same amount of honorarium is given to top administrators, regardless of the amount of work they have done.For 2020-21, Prof Dr Amir Hossain, former pro-VC (administration), received Tk 1.43 lakh for being a member of the admission test's governing body, while Prof Sheikh Monjurul Haq, the current pro-VC, received the same amount.Prof Amir said, ""I attended eight meetings as the pro-VC. So, I was given the full honorarium.""Treasurer Rasheda Akhtar, also chair of the university's finance committee, said, ""Pro-VCs are seniors and respectable persons. Distributing money among them based on work is insulting and the practice of awarding them with the full honorarium is nothing new.""Prof Anu Muhammad, economist and former faculty member of JU, termed this form of distribution illogical.""This is unacceptable and insulting for us. Not only for five years, this has been going on for more than a decade. The authorities grab a huge amount of money in name of honorariums. The work they do is the bare minimum for such amounts.""""UGC has submitted a report for the 2019-20 session. But this is not enough. An overall investigation is needed for every session. The authorities should lower the money taken for admission forms and ensure that the money earned from admission tests be used for the university's welfare,"" he added.VC Prof Nurul Alam said, ""I rejected a big amount of this year's honorarium allocated for me.""The authorities, however, did not explain the rationale behind such honorariums."

/opinion/views/news/the-gaps-dap-how-avoid-urban-flooding-dhaka-3146456,The gaps in DAP: How to avoid urban flooding in Dhaka,"The Detailed Area Plan (DAP) 2016-2035, developed by Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) for the planned urbanisation of Dhaka metropolitan area, has created an opportunity for our capital city to be contemporary and hospitable. The plan puts emphasis on several key areas, such as area-based population density patterns, transit-based as well as block-based development, criteria for civic amenities, hawker management guidelines, inclusion of new and neglected areas as well as land readjustment and redevelopment, conservation of heritage and its geomorphology, etc. These initiatives do deserve applause, but there are certain issues that require rethinking.Out of the 1,528 square kilometres of Dhaka Metropolitan Area (under the jurisdiction of DAP-Rajuk), 1,008 square kilometres is floodplain area, and the rest is flood-free. So, floodplains make up about 66 percent of the greater Dhaka metropolitan area. This area is divided into two zones in the DAP: flood flow, which is 25 percent of the entire DAP area, and general floodplain, which is about 41 percent of the DAP area. The general floodplains have been given conditional land development options. The flood flow area is further divided into main flood flow and general flood flow, with the general flood flow area comprising about 12 percent of the DAP area. This way, 80 percent of the total identified floodplain areas – which is more than half of Dhaka metropolitan – has been brought under conditional land development by means of categorisation of these areas. Only 12 percent has been identified as the main flood flow area, where land development has been prohibited.DAP also provides conditional construction rights in 28.86 percent of the area identified as agricultural land, allowing the construction of eco-resorts, bungalows, villas, single-family homes, government schools, and other structures. There is also scope for building – conditionally – multi-family units, hospitals, waste management centres and transfer stations, incinerators, dairy and poultry farms, mills, etc. Conditional as they are, such provisions can lead to a spree of construction on floodplains by commercial entities. These loopholes are likely to lead to the destruction of agricultural lands.
It must be mentioned that in areas such as the northern part of Keraniganj, Savar and the vast low-lying lands in Gazipur, many different types of crops are grown. These areas are a source of vegetables for Dhaka. Also, a large amount of paddy is produced in these areas during Boro season. If, as per DAP proposal, these lands are used for construction, Dhaka will be cut off from a major source of food and agricultural items. Such options will only cater to the interests of the so-called housing and other business entities, not the general public.Dhaka, a city and the central hub of Bangladesh, already suffers from urban flooding, waterlogging, and a significant drop in groundwater levels. Providing scope for construction and development in flood flow areas and agricultural lands surrounding the metropolitan will make the situation even worse. If these options are not reconsidered, chances are Dhaka might see catastrophic floods in the coming years – much like what we saw in Sylhet earlier this year.The DAP proposal to establish a ""Blue Network"" comprising waterways is admirable. But simply laying waterways and replacing culverts with bridges will not help. In order to protect them, Dhaka's canals have to be revived first through comprehensive restoration. The proposal of the urban life line in DAP is also commendable and appropriate. In parallel to the establishment of urban life lines and the restoration of canals, special attention must be ensured for the establishment of necessary connections among them. However, the DAP has not included a list of the 54 canals (currently reduced to 26) identified by the River Task Force of the National River Conservation Commission. Therefore, a clear proposal with a responsible implementation authority is necessary to save these canals on a priority basis, with a precise list and implementation plan, to establish a true Blue Network.The DAP maps out a pathway to achieve a liveable Dhaka for all. Such a city must have an intertwined network of natural blue and green. In order to establish this network, it is necessary to revive, restore and conserve its water bodies. The provisions for construction in the sensitive lowlands pose a serious threat to the future of this megacity. Rajuk should therefore evaluate and adjust DAP's proposals by assessing their possible impacts. One of the important components of implementing the DAP is collaborative nurturing, and it is via this that a good, balanced, transparent, elegant, and universally acceptable master plan should be ensured.

/news/bangladesh/transport/news/100-new-bridges-opening-once-3146286,100 new bridges opening at once,"The government is likely to simultaneously open 100 new bridges at the end of this month, giving a big boost to the country's road network.Most of the bridges have been constructed on regional highways and district roads and these would replace risky Bailey bridges and narrow and dilapidated ones.The Roads and Highways Department (RHD), the implementing agency of the bridges, has spent Tk 906.32 crore to construct the bridges, which will increase the reliability and efficiency of its road network.The highest 41 bridges would be opened in Khagrachhari, followed by 18 bridges, including the long-awaited Kushiara and Surma bridges, to be inaugurated in Sunamganj.The total length of the 100 bridges would be around 5.87km.""Opening of 100 bridges simultaneously would be a historic moment for the country,"" said RHD's Chief Engineer AKM Manir Hossain Pathan.He said they were taking preparations for opening the bridges, and the date of inauguration would be set upon getting consent from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.""We hope the bridges would be opened within this month,"" he told The Daily Star yesterday.One important aspect is that all the bridges have been built with the government funds and all the designs are developed by the bridge wing of RHD, the chief engineer added.On October 10, Hasina inaugurated the Modhumoti Bridge in Narail and Bir Muktijodhhda AKM Nasim Osman 3rd Shitalakkhya Bridge in Narayanganj.Speaking at the event, Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader sought time from the prime minister to open the 100 bridges.Talking to reporters on Sunday, Quader said the prime minister would take part virtually in the inauguration programme held in at least three places, where most of the bridges would be opened.There are over 4,500 bridges and around 13,800 culverts under the 22,476km road network of RHD. Of the road network, 3,991km is national highways, 4,897km regional highways and 13,588km  district roads.National highways connect the capital with divisional headquarters, sea ports, land ports and international highways. Regional highways connect district towns with river ports and land ports. District roads link district towns with upazila headquarters or one upazila HQ with another.Shishir Kanti Routh, additional chief engineer (bridge management wing) of RHD, said opening the 100 bridges would further increase the capacity and efficiency of the road network.He added that around half of the 100 bridges would be opened in three hilly districts, which would improve the road communications of the region and boost tourism there.Shishir said they would replace all Bailey and narrow bridges gradually and already started a feasibility study for constructing over 100 more bridges.The highest 45 bridges would be opened in Chattogram zone of RHD, 18 in Sylhet, 14 in Barishal, two in Dhaka, six in Mymensingh, one in Cumilla, five in Gopalganj and Rajshahi each and four in Rangpur zones.Ataur Rahman, additional chief engineer of Chattogram zone of RHD, said out of 45 bridges, the highest 41 would be opened in Khagrachhari, two in Dohazari in Chattogram and one each in Rangamati and Bandarban.Most of the bridges are on district roads and some on the regional highways, and the bridges would mainly replace Bailey bridges, he told this correspondent yesterday.Mahmud Al-Nur Salehin, RHD's Rangamati division executive engineer, also currently working as executive engineer of Khagrachhari, said the number of roads in the hilly districts are very limited.The roads often become non-operational following the collapse of any of the Bailey bridges, he said.""So, construction of the new bridges will ensure uninterrupted road communications between different districts and upazilas,"" he told The Daily Star yesterday.All 18 bridges, including the long-awaited Kushiara ones, in the Sylhet zone will be inaugurated from Sunamganj.The project to construct the 702m bridge over the Kushiara river in Sunamganj began in June 2014 and it was supposed to be completed within three years. The bridge, which has been constructed spending Tk 155 crore, is finally going to open.Opening of the bridge will cut distance between Sunamganj and Dhaka by 55km as the bridgewill directly link the district withDhaka-Sylhet highway, Ashraful Islam Pramanik, executive engineer of Sunamganj RHD, told this correspondent.Another major bridge is the 402m Surma bridge, which will connect Doarabazar upazila and Chatak upazila headquarters with Sylhet city directly, he said. Other bridges, all two-lane ones, will actually replace narrow and risky Bailey bridges, he added.Out of 14 bridges in the Barishal zone, four are in Barishal, Jhalakathi and Pirojpur each and two in Patuakhali, said Masud Mahmud Sumon, executive engineer of Barishal RHD.   "

But Cross was undone when Campher came into the attack and he was deceived by a slower delivery, caught for 28.Jones played beautifully and brought up his maiden T20 half-century off 38 balls with a single, ably supported by Berrington (37) then Michael Leask (17) before eventually falling in the penultimate over.

""However, the IFC will have to apply and take approval to issue bonds from the BSEC following the securities rules and regulations,"" it said.The IFC is keen to expand its financing in taka for clients in Bangladesh who do not generate US dollars as a part of their daily operations, the IFC said in its letter.The bonds will help support the growing financing needs of various priority sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, those related to climate change, microfinance and lenders focusing on small and medium enterprises and women-owned enterprises.It will also support the government's efforts to develop and grow the domestic capital market in Bangladesh.BSEC Chairman Prof Shibli Rubayat-Ul-Islam agreed that the bond would give new impetus to the development of the country's bond market.The BSEC is trying to make the bond market vibrant as the market can give a good source of funds to entrepreneurs, he said.It has already made treasury bills and bonds tradable on the stock exchanges with the help of Bangladesh Bank and the National Board of Revenue.There are about 270 treasury bonds worth more than Tk 2.5 lakh crore and with tenures ranging from two years to 20 years, showed data from Bangladesh Bank.Of them, 222 were listed on Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) as of August, with a combined value of Tk 59,359 crore.But they were not traded like shares and mutual fund units, which require availing a beneficiary owner's account first.Rather they could be bought and sold straight over the counter, much like savings certificates.""The IFC wants to issue bonds worth $4 billion and the IFC is not alone. Asian Development Bank (ADB) also wants to issue bonds in the Bangladesh stock market. It would be better for our stock market,"" added Islam. "

The glass around the counter was all shattered.""According to another witness, security forces locked down the area around the sprawling, colonial-era prison after the blasts.Pictures in local media purporting to capture the aftermath showed what appeared to be blood stains on the floor around a counter, and shattered windows behind.There was no claim of responsibility.A junta spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.Inmates in Myanmar's prisons often rely on friends or family members for food and medicine supplies.Rights groups say hundreds of political prisoners are held in Insein, including former British ambassador to Myanmar Vicky Bowman and Japanese journalist Toru Kubota.Hearings at the special court inside the prison compound were cancelled for the day after the blasts, according to a local lawyer who did not want to give their name.Conflict has spiralled in Myanmar since the coup.Self-declared civilian ""people's defence forces"" have sprung up to fight the junta, surprising the military with their effectiveness, some analysts say.Across the country, there are almost daily killings of low-level junta officials or anti-coup activists, with details murky and reprisals often following quickly.While most of the violence has occurred in rural areas, Yangon has also been rocked by a spate of bombings.In July, a bomb blast near a shopping mall in Yangon killed two people and wounded 11.In May, a blast near a bus stop in a busy neighbourhood in the city killed one man and wounded nine people.The junta later said the bomb had gone off accidentally and that the victim had been in contact with PDF groups it has declared ""terrorists"".More than 2,300 people have been killed in the military's crackdown on dissent since the coup and over 15,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group.The junta blames anti-coup fighters for the deaths of almost 3,900 civilians."
/opinion/views/news/the-trouble-technology-3146736,The trouble with technology,"An important global debate is underway about the disruptive impact of new technology. There is no doubt modern technology has been a force for good and responsible for innumerable positive developments – empowering people, improving lives, increasing productivity, advancing medical and scientific knowledge and transforming societies. Technological developments have helped to drive unprecedented social and economic progress. But the fourth industrial revolution has also involved the evolution of advance technologies that are creating disruption, new vulnerabilities and harmful repercussions, which are not fully understood, much less managed. A digitalised world is facing the challenge of cybersecurity as threats rise across the world. Data theft and fraud, cyberattacks and breaches of critical systems, electricity networks and financial markets are all part of rising risks.Communication technology now dominates our lives like never before. It brings untold benefits but also presents new dangers. The phenomenon of fake news for example is not new. But its omnipresence today has much to do with digital technology, which has produced a proliferation of information channels and expansion of social media. Online platforms have become vehicles for the spread of misinformation. Fake news easily circulates due to the magnifying power of social media in a mostly unregulated environment. Anonymity in social media platforms gives trolls and purveyors of false stories the assurance they will not be held accountable for their lies or hate messages. So fake news is posted on social media without fear of retribution. ""Deepfakes"" – doctored videos using artificial intelligence (AI) – are now commonly used to mislead and deceive.The profit motive and business model of social media companies prevents them from instituting real checks on divisive and sensational content irrespective of whether it is true or false. That means 'digital wildfires' are rarely contained. Digital technology is also being abused to commit crimes, recruit terrorists and spread hate, all of which imperil societies. This presents challenges to social stability in what is now called the post-truth era.Digital technology is also fuelling polarisation and divisiveness within countries. Studies have pointed to its disruptive impact on political systems and democracy. In an article in the European Journal of Futures Research in March 2022, the authors wrote that ""In times of scepticism and a marked dependence on different types of AI in a network full of bots, trolls, and fakes, unprecedented standards of polarisation and intolerance are intensifying and crystallising with the coming to power of leaders of dubious democratic reputation"". The connection between the rise of right-wing populist leaders and their cynical but effective deployment of social media is now well established.Artificial intelligence or machine intelligence presents many dangers such as invasion of privacy and compromise of multiple dimensions of security. The biggest threat posed by autonomous weapons systems is that they can take decisions and even strategies out of human hands. They can independently target and neutralise adversaries and operate without the benefit of human judgement or thoughtful calculation of risks. Today, AI is fuelling an arms race in lethal autonomous weapons in a new arena of superpower competition.The book, co-authored by Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt and Daniel Huttenlocher, The Age of AI: And our Human Future, lays bare the dangers ahead. AI has ushered in a new period of human consciousness, say the authors (Schmidt is Google's former CEO), which ""augers a revolution in human affairs"". But this, they argue, can lead to human beings losing the ability to reason, reflect and conceptualise. It could in fact ""permanently change our relationship with reality"".Their discussion of the military uses of AI and how it is used to fight wars is especially instructive. AI would enhance conventional, nuclear and cyber capabilities in ways that would make security relations between rival powers more problematic and conflicts harder to limit. The authors say that in the nuclear era, the goal of national security strategy was deterrence. This depended on a set of key assumptions – the adversary's known capabilities, recognised doctrines and predictable responses. Their core argument about the destabilising nature of AI weapons and cyber capabilities is that their value and efficacy stems from their ""opacity and deniability and in some cases their operation at the ambiguous borders of disinformation, intelligence collection and sabotage … creating strategies without acknowledged doctrines"". They see this as leading to calamitous outcomes. They note the race for AI dominance between China and the US, which other countries are likely to join. AI capabilities are challenging the traditional notion of security and this intelligent book emphasises that the injection of ""nonhuman logic to military systems"" can result in disaster.Advanced new generation military technologies are a source of increasing concern because of their wide implications for international peace and stability. The remote-control war waged by US-led Western forces in Afghanistan over two decades involved the use of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones. This had serious consequences and resulted in the killing of innocent people. The use of a cyberweapon – the Stuxnet computer worm – by the US to target Iranian facilities in 2007 to degrade its nuclear programme was the first attack of its kind. More recently, Russian and Ukrainian militaries are using remotely operated aerial platforms in the Ukraine conflict. Reliance on technology can confront countries at war with unexpected problems. For example, frontline Ukrainian soldiers have faced outages of the internet satellite service which was supposed to prevent Russian forces from using that technology. This digital disruption is reported to have caused a crucial loss of communication between Ukraine's military forces.Despite the risks and dangers of such new technologies, there is no international effort aimed at managing them much less regulating their use. There is no move by big powers for any dialogue on cyber and AI arms control. If the global internet can't be regulated and giant, unaccountable social media companies continue to rake in excessive profits, there is even less prospect of mitigating the destabilising effects of cyber and AI-enabled military capabilities.Maleeha Lodhi is a former ambassador to the US, UK & the UN.

The actor appeared virtually with their lawyer Bennington Superior Court. Miller is accused of breaking into a residence in Stamford, Vermont on May 1, 2022. Following an investigation, Vermont State Police discovered several missing bottles of alcohol from the property while the homeowners were not present.After collecting statements and reviewing surveillance footage, police charged Miller with felony burglary. The petit larceny charge states that the stolen items were less than USD 900 in total value, reported Variety.The felony burglary charge has a maximum of 25 years in prison and a USD 1,000 maximum fine. The larceny charge is a maximum of one year and a similar USD 1,000 fine. Miller also agreed not to have any contact with the homeowner or return to the residence.As per Variety, Miller's attorney Lisa B. Shelkrot has said, ""Ezra Miller this morning pled not guilty to one count of burglary and one count of petit larceny in Vermont Superior Court and accepted the court-imposed conditions of not contacting or entering the home of the inhabitants.""She added, ""Ezra would like to acknowledge the love and support they have received from their family and friends, who continue to be a vital presence in their ongoing mental health,""The Vermont charges were just a couple of the controversies and legal issues Miller has been facing in recent months.The embattled actor was arrested on two separate occasions in Hawaii, once in March for disorderly conduct and harassment following an incident at a karaoke bar, and again in April for an alleged assault in which Miller was accused of striking a woman on the head at a private residence.Further, the parents of an 18-year-old filed an order of protection against Miller, alleging the actor groomed their child from the age of 12, though the child has denied it, reported The Hollywood Reporter. In August, Miller apologized for their past behaviour and began undergoing mental health treatment.Meanwhile, on the work front, Miller was first introduced as 'The Flash' in Joss Whedon's 2017 released 'Justice League'. The actor will be reprising the superhero role in 'The Flash', which following several delays is set to release in theatres on June 23, 2023."

/business/economy/news/shrimp-exports-shrivel-q1-3146211,Shrimp exports shrivel in Q1,"Shrimp exports from Bangladesh fell in the first quarter of the current fiscal year due to weak demand in the EU and the US markets, which have been gripped by the fears of a coming recession amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.Considering the drop in export orders, overall export earnings from the sector may decline by up to 35 per cent by the end of fiscal 2022-23, according to industry operators.Earnings from shrimp exports in the first quarter (July-September) stood at $100.10 million, down 18 per cent from $122.73 million during the same period in fiscal 2020-21, shows data from the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).And although earnings from shrimp exports grew 24 per cent year-on-year to $407 million in the last fiscal, the sector's current performance presents a bleak picture.""Total earnings from shrimp exports may drop by 30-35 per cent by the end of this fiscal year,"" said Md Amin Ullah, president of the Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association (BFFEA).The Russia-Ukraine war has caused a decline in shipments to the two nations while buyers in the EU and the US are offering lower prices in fears of a coming recession.""Whereas we would previously get $2 lakh for shipping a single container to the EU, we are now getting $1.5 lakh for the same volume,"" he added.Ullah then said the reduced demand comes down to the fact that people in the EU are unwilling to purchase luxury items such as shrimp considering the recent economic shocks.S Humayun Kabir, chairman of Amam Sea Food Industry Ltd, said although the sector's performance in the first quarter of this fiscal year shows that earnings from shrimp exports have fallen by 18 per cent, overall exports have actually declined by at least 30 per cent.He then reasoned that fluctuations in the US dollar exchange rate have given them a bit of relief as exporters are benefitting from the high dollar price against Bangladeshi taka.About getting lower orders, he said the whole of Europe is now witnessing a silent financial crisis that has greatly contributed to the fall in export orders.Besides, importers are offering at least 25-30 per cent lower prices compared to last year, he added.Kabir went on to say that local shrimp farmers are failing to secure adequate returns due to the low prices being offered in foreign markets, which will discourage them from continuing the business.""The situation is so dire that many buyers are renegotiating the prices of previously placed orders and as such, stocks are piling up at almost every processing factory,"" said Kabir, who is also vice-president of the BFFEA.The volume of shrimp being exported from Khulna, a major producing region, declined by about 16 per cent to 7,027 tonnes in the July-September period of the ongoing fiscal year, according to the BFFEA.Shyamal Das, managing director of MU Sea Food Ltd, said the demand for locally produced shrimp is declining abroad for its higher price compared to the cheaper vannamei or whiteleg varieties produced elsewhere.""It is a very bad situation as prices are falling fast while sales are down,"" he said.A kilogramme of headless black tiger shrimp is now selling for $12 while it was $14 as recently as three months ago.According to Das, the demand for shrimp in the EU has declined by more than 40 per cent.""As our black tiger shrimp is usually consumed as a luxury food in restaurants and hotels, EU importers are pushing back their shipment orders in fear of a recession,"" he said.""In this situation, we are falling behind the competition with vannamei shrimp, which is shipped at lower prices from countries like Vietnam and China,"" Das added.Each kilogramme of vannamei shrimp is currently being sold for $2-2.5 less than the same amount of black tiger shrimp in international markets.The sector ensures the livelihood of more than 8 lakh farmers, who collectively cultivate shrimp on 2.63 lakh hectares of land in coastal areas of the country's southwest region, according to the Department of Fisheries."

/sports/cricket/news/bounce-and-movement-mirpur-3146581,'Bounce and movement? Is this Mirpur?',"""Is that extra bounce in Mirpur?""Even well-trained eyes were deceived and one could be forgiven for thinking that they needed a good rub to banish the afternoon slumber.The drifting clouds at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur saw slightly overcast conditions in intervals between sunny proceedings during the second day's play of the National Cricket League (NCL) match between Chattogram and Rangpur Division yesterday.As Test openers Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudul Hasan Joy came out to bat for Chattogram's second innings, they knew they would be tested after having been bundled out for 126 in the first innings.Rangpur pacers Mukidul Islam Mugdho and Mushfik Hasan certainly tested the duo in that first spell. A few flashy shots often did not meet the bat and the extra bounce on the surface was having its say. So were the Duke balls -- used for the first time in Bangladesh -- kicking from the surface.Tamim went on to middle some of his trademark shots with the fast outfield helping his cause. But despite those boundaries, the left-hander was not quite comfortable during his knock.Once Joy departed to a cover drive off Mugdho for 14-ball seven, the challenge on the surface continued despite overcast conditions giving way to a sunny afternoon.After an initial nine-over spell from Mugdho and Mushfiq, Rangpur operated with medium pacers Alauddin and Abdullah Al Mamun. And it was the former who got some extra bounce that led to Tamim's downfall, dismissed trying to glance a delivery that went to wicketkeeper Akbar Ali.Mominul Haque would be the next to face the music as Rangpur kept operating with pace from both ends.More importantly, the pace and movement on offer led to four fielders positioned in the slip cordon for almost the whole of the Chattogram innings on Day Two.The lacquer on the Duke balls persist over longer periods and pacers were pitching it full, egged on by the movement they were getting. The balls mostly left batters at waist height, giving head to extraordinary conditions at Mirpur, which has historically seen slow carry and deliveries stopping after landing.One delivery from Mamun clipped Mominul's bat as it just moved away a shade after pitching and the former Bangladesh skipper departed to a 37-ball 22, bringing Chattogram skipper Irfan Shukkur to the crease. Shamim Hossain fell after a delivery rose sharply while he played the cut shot. He later indicated the extra bounce had done the trick.Irfan tried to counter the movement by going far out of his crease for a couple of deliveries and his unbeaten 48-ball 50 helped Chattogram to 126 for six when the bails were drawn for the day, leading by 30 runs.Only one over of spin was bowled as Nasir Hossain took over for the final over of the day.One player, who has been playing in the NCL for a long time, said after the day's proceedings: ""It's the kind of wicket we need here. Quite hard (surface) and the Duke ball too is used elsewhere,"" he noted on the prominent seam of the Duke balls. Another player, recently playing in the NCL, told this reporter: ""It's a good wicket although couldn't bat for too long.""The players appeared happy with the challenge that faced them, a sign of good things amidst the gloomy national team performances in the T20 World Cup endeavor. Talking to a BCB official involved with the NCL heavily, the reporter was told that these kinds of wickets are being demanded now. ""The surface is hard and we have left grass on it which helps extra bounce too.""Asked if the Duke ball was having its say, he concurred and said: ""Yes. They are going with pace throughout, that's an indication.""With India coming to tour Bangladesh in December, such surfaces will train batters for faster hands and see more bowlers with ability to impact games. This will help develop Test cricket mentality not just for the India series but for the future as a whole."

/business/economy/news/time-remove-barriers-weighing-businesses-down-3146426,Time to remove barriers weighing businesses down,"Post-pandemic, the speed in planning and execution will be the determining factor for businesses to survive amid changing behaviour of consumers and the volatility in the global supply chain. But Bangladesh does not seem to be well-prepared to support businesses looking to thrive in the changing times as cumbersome processes still dominate and entrepreneurs struggle to secure necessary documents from government offices.Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the country ranked lowly in the now-defunct World Bank's global ranking of the ease of doing business index mainly because of the delay in issuing important documents from government offices.Although Bangladesh advanced eight notches to 168 out of 190 counties in the Doing Business 2020 report, the last report published by the multilateral lender in 2019 before it was scrapped for data irregularities last year, the challenges ranging from regulatory barriers and weak infrastructure to inadequate energy supply have kept stifling local businesses. The predicament faced by startups and small enterprises is even deeper since their financial capability is not strong enough to manage documents from government offices by spending additional money. As a result, fresh entrepreneurs feel discouraged in making investments sometimes.Owing to the complexity, Bangladesh is also one of the lowest recipients of foreign direct investment and many foreign investors leave the country after carrying out initial surveys.Usually, prospective investors in Bangladesh require to collect 42 signatures from various government offices to set up a venture.Recently, a study report from the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) said opening a factory requires quite a long list of 18 commercial documents in addition to the environmental certificate.Some of the major requirements are export registration certification, trade licences, value-added tax certificate, tax identification number, the article of the memorandum, the certification of incorporation, bonded warehouse licence, and construction certification.In order to meet the structural or building safety standards, factories need building permits from the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha, city corporations, municipalities, or development authorities, depending on their location.Businesses also have to obtain certificates on designs, city survey documents, and the copy of allotment letters, said the CPD study report.The scenario is much different in Vietnam, one of the competitors of Bangladesh, according to a businessman.For example, a Taiwanese investor in Vietnam needs to fulfil eight requirements and requires five weeks and $2,940 to start a new business venture, he said.Entrepreneurs complain that doing business is becoming difficult day by day because of the additional time and money spent on obtaining government documents and permissions.They allege that they are harassed by the officials of various offices under the National Board of Revenue (NBR) for services related to tax, customs and bonded warehouses.Local entrepreneurs are already in a tight spot for the worsening gas crisis and the delay in the release of goods from ports.Businesses already have to wait 11 days and six hours to have their cargoes released after their arrival at seaports, according to the Time Release Study 2022 of the NBR. Land ports take 10 days and eight hours and airports take seven days and 11 hours to deliver goods.And the challenges confronting entrepreneurs show no sign of abating although businesses urgently need to improve their efficiency with a view to becoming more competitive in the international markets as duty benefits could go following the country's graduation from the group of least-developed countries in 2026.Large business groups have been able to navigate through the web of complexities and corrupt practices on the back of their financial muscle, but small companies are failing to operate in the same environment, said another entrepreneur.Businesses have demanded the extension of the tenure of trade licences to three to five years from one year in a bid to save time and money.Corruption is also a major barrier standing in the way of businesses.According to a study by the Center for Governance Studies, more than half of SMEs in Bangladesh have to pay a bribe to obtain essential services such as acquiring and renewing licences, using public utilities, and obtaining the tax identification number and the value-added tax certificate.In terms of perception, almost nine out of 10 SMEs believe corruption is pervasive in the SME sector, it said.At the event where the CPD shared the study report, a businessman said he had to pay Tk30,000 to obtain a certificate from an office of the NBR for import purposes.In another frustrating development, the One Stop Service Centre under the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority has not been fully functional. The state agency is supposed to provide more than 150 services from a single window to ease business processes.The CPD suggested the introduction of a one-stop service at every regulatory body that provides any permits.As Bangladesh recovers from the coronavirus pandemic and is set to become a developing country in four years and aspires to be a developed economy in less than two decades, the need for speeding up regulatory reforms has only grown.  A congenial business environment is also needed to make the most of the 21st century dubbed as the Asian Century as large nations in the continent are expected to play a dominant role globally in the coming decades.According to McKinsey & Company, $1 out of every $2 of global consumption in the next 10 years is going to take place in Asia, indicating the importance of growing businesses in Asian countries.Bangladesh should utilise this opportunity by eliminating all trade barriers and improving business climate."

/news/bangladesh/news/hill-razed-road-3146531,Hill razed for road,"A group of individuals has reportedly cut a hill by Chattogram city's Sarson Road to build a road, without getting approval from the Department of Environment (DoE), much to the dismay of locals and environmentalists.For the road's construction, they cut a significant part of Joy Pahar, an old hill in the area, violating the law.DoE officials confirmed that they visited the area and found evidence of hill cutting. The authorities issued a show-cause notice to the group.During a visit to the area on Sunday, this correspondent found that the hill has been cut to build the 650-feet long road. Many trees have fallen victim too.Some locals, requesting anonymity, claimed that the group is building the new road to make the hills accessible. After that, it will flatten the hills to make housing plots.This hill is owned by the heirs of a person named Mozaffar Ahmad Miah.This correspondent could not reach Abdul Kader, a son of late Mozaffar, despite several attempts over phone and text.According to Bangladesh Environment Preservation Act 1995 (amended in 2000), cutting a hill without DoE's approval is illegal.The punishment for breaking the law is up to two years' imprisonment or Tk 2 lakh fine, or both for first-time offenders. For subsequent offence, it is up to 10 years' imprisonment or Tk 10 lakh fine or both.Mia Mahmudul Hoque, deputy director of DoE Chattogram's metro office, told The Daily Star that those who are building the road have been ordered to appear in person for a hearing at DoE office and explain why the offenders should not be penalised.Mohammad Kamal Hossain, former professor of Institute of Forestry and Environmental Science at Chittagong University, said if the road is constructed, the environment of the area would be harmed.According to data of Bangladesh Environment Forum, 120 hills disappeared from Chattogram city in four decades. In 1976, there were 32.37 square km of hills in the port city, which decreased to 14.02 square km in 2008.The data showed that there were 200 hills in the city 40 years ago, and 60 percent of them have disappeared. Of them, Chattogram Development Authority cut 15 hills for building Bayezid Link Road."

/news/bangladesh/news/why-relax-policy-rescheduling-loans-3146546,Why relax policy for rescheduling loans?,"The High Court yesterday questioned the legality of Bangladesh Bank's decision to grossly relax the policy for rescheduling defaulted loans.It issued a rule asking respondents to explain in four weeks why the central bank circular issued on July 18, which stated changes that reportedly patronise loan defaulters, should not be scrapped.Eight government high officials -- including the cabinet secretary, principal secretary to the prime minister's office, finance secretary, law secretary and BB governor -- have been made respondents to the rule.The bench of Justice JBM Hassan and Justice Razik-Al-Jalil issued the rule, after rights organisation Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh (HRPB) filed a writ petition, challenging the legality of the circular.According to the circular, defaulters will now get a maximum of eight years to repay term loans instead of two years, as previously stipulated.Defaulters will reportedly also be allowed to reschedule their non-performing loans (NPLs) four times instead of three, along with other benefits, according to the BB notice.During yesterday's hearing, HRPB lawyer Manzill Murshid told the court that BB has issued the notice to patronise big loan defaulters, which is discriminatory and contradictory to the constitution.Depositors will be harmed, and the financial condition of banks will weaken because of the new provisions, he argued.Attorney General AM Amin Uddin opposed the petition, saying that BB issued the circular for public interest and as per the government's policy decision.The central bank has the legal right to issue such circulars for public interest, and therefore, the petition is not acceptable, the attorney general argued."

""We invited them to discuss if the decision regarding the Gaibnadha-5 by-polls was fine in line with law. Everybody said it was correct,"" he said. The CEC said that the former election commissioners and secretaries advised the EC to maintain ""continuity"" of its work and action.He said that the former election commissioners also told the EC that use of the CCTV cameras and the EVMs are helpful in holding a free and fair election.But former Election Commissioner Sakhawat Hossain told reporters that he advised the EC to use the CCTV cameras more instead of EVMs.""Good or bad, there is controversy about EVMs. More use of CCTV cameras will be better with the (same) budget meant for the EVMs at 150 parliamentary seats,"" he said. ""Where EVMs are needed, use them. (But) ballot papers are possible to find out if they are taken (snatched by someone). Subtle manipulation is possible with EVMs. There is no chaos outside, nothing, but what was going on inside in Gaibandha that we saw,"" he said.Sakhawat said that the Election Commission must maintain the continuity of what it has done regarding Gaibandha-5 by-polls.Otherwise, he said, people would think that the EC cancelled the election in Gaibandha to just demonstrate a scenario for a different reason. ""So far so good, don't skip the next steps. If you do, then a different message will be sent to the nation that you have done this to show,"" he said. He said that the EC should take action against the people responsible for manipulation in Gaibandha.""If you fail to find out who is guilty and if you don't take action regarding Gaibandha, then you will not get (the people's) confidence in the future. So, it must be done,"" he said. ""Measures should be taken by applying the power that is there. Action should be taken against the officials who have issued letters claiming that the election was fair,"" he said in reference to the points he shared during the meeting with the EC.About the recent move to bring the NID registration under the Ministry of Home Affairs from the Election Commission, he said: ""Why does the government want to take NID registration under the ministry? That is not clear. The Election Commission has developed the system for so many years. Whenever it will be taken the voter list will be questionable at some points, which is not right.""Former chief election commissioners Abdur Rauf, KM Nurul Huda, Kazi Rakib Uddin Ahmed, former election commissioners M Sakhawat Hossain, Rafiqul Islam, Kavita Khanam, former EC secretaries Mohammad Sadiq, Mohammad Abdullah, Sirajul Islam, Helal Uddin Ahmed, and former additional secretaries Jasmine Tuli and Mokhleshur Rahman took part in the discussion."
/news/asia/india/news/congress-president-election-mallikarjun-kharge-wins-the-race-3146781,Kharge becomes first non-Gandhi Congress President in 24 years,"India's Congress party appointed Wednesday an octogenarian ex-minister as its first president in 24 years not from the Gandhi dynasty, in an effort to reverse its apparent steady decline into political oblivion.Mallikarjun Kharge, 80, was elected by members to replace Sonia Gandhi as president of the once-mighty party that helped win India's independence 75 years ago.Congress governed India for decades after independence from Britain in 1947, but is now a shadow of its former self, discredited and crushed under the electoral juggernaut of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The Gandhi family is not related to India's independence icon Mahatma Gandhi,but descended from the country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.Nehru was the father of prime minister Indira Gandhi, assassinated in 1984. She was the mother of Rajiv Gandhi, killed by a suicide bomber in 1991.The BJP thrashed Congress at the last two elections, with Modi deriding party president Rahul Gandhi -- son of Rajiv and Sonia -- as an out-of-touch princeling and playboy.After the latest defeat in 2019, Rahul Gandhi resigned as party president and handed the reins back to his Italian-born mother Sonia, now 75, who was first appointed to the role in 1998.Kharge, a veteran politician, was born five years before independence and is widely believed to the have the backing of both Sonia and Rahul.Rahul Gandhi said Wednesday that Kharge is now the supreme authority in the party and that he ""will decide my role in the party"".Despite stepping back, Sonia and Rahul are expected to continue pulling the strings from behind the scenes.Kharge now faces the mammoth challenge of winning the next national election, due in 2024, and three state elections next year.That includes in his home state of Karnataka, where he personally has won 11 of the dozen elections he has contested during his long career in the Congress party.Kharge faced off against Shashi Tharoor, 66, who campaigned for ""change"" in the leadership.Tharoor conceded defeat on Twitter and said that being Congress president was a ""great honour & a huge responsibility"", wishing Kharge ""all success in the task"".The party was reduced to just 53 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament after the last national election swept by the BJP with 303 seats.A decision to elect a non-Gandhi president showed that Congress was ""weary of criticism from BJP and Modi"", Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation and close watcher of the party for years, told AFP.He added that there was a ""fair chance"" that Kharge may turn around the party's fortunes.""He may be 80 but is in good health and a workaholic. He meets party leaders about state and regional issues. He can provide a healing touch to the party ranks,"" Kidwai said.""But ultimately, in an electoral democracy what matters is winning elections."""

""Damal"" also stars Siam Ahmed, Rashed Mamun Apu, and Sumit, among many others.In a candid conversation with The Daily Star, Sariful Razz opened up about his love for football, his role in ""Damal"" and much more.It seems like football has truly become your trusty 'best friend'.  We don't see you anywhere without your football nowadays.
Honestly speaking, I don't go anywhere without my trusty football. My whole life revolves around it now, and I am always taking pictures with it.



Which international football team do you support?
I am a huge fan of Brazil and my all-time favourite player is Ronaldinho
How did you perform the iconic 'bicycle kick' in ""Damal""?



 








I had zero knowledge about how to do a bicycle kick. Thus, when the director told me that I had to perform the bicycle kick in a scene, I had major doubts about whether I would be able to execute it to perfection. I spent 3-4 months getting into the skin of my character in the film. So, I tried my best to make sure that scene was perfect, and I am really pleased with how it was shown in the trailer. The cinematographer truly captured the scene brilliantly in the film.
In the film, it feels as if football is more important than your wife? Why did it look like your wife was angry at you?

Unfortunately, in the film, my wedding date and football match fell on the same day. Time was ticking and the Kazi was taking a lot of time. So, I had to stop him in the middle by shouting 'Alhamdulillah Kobul', before running off towards the field. When I returned after the match, my wife had locked the door and refused to let me enter. To know what happens next, the audiences will have to wait till October 28.

""Damal"" is inspired by the Shadhin Bangla Football Team, which was formed in 1971 during the Liberation War. In the movie, I play the captain of that team. When they go to the theatres, the audience will get to see my love for football in this film.
Both your films, ""Hawa"" and ""Poran"", are still playing in theatres. ""Damal"" will also be released soon. What are your expectations from this upcoming film?
I am really happy that both my movies ""Poran"" and ""Hawa"" are doing exceptionally well at theatres. ""Damal"" will also be released next week and thus I am hopeful that the audience will shower their love on this movie as well.

Unfortunately, in the film, my wedding date and football match fell on the same day. Time was ticking and the Kazi was taking a lot of time. So, I had to stop him in the middle by shouting 'Alhamdulillah Kobul', before running off towards the field. When I returned after the match, my wife had locked the door and refused to let me enter. To know what happens next, the audiences will have to wait till October 28.Tell us a little bit more about 'Damal'?

/business/news/mv-trans-samudera-leaves-ctg-port-indian-transit-container-3146716,“M/v Trans Samudera” leaves Ctg Port with Indian transit container,"A vessel named 'M/v Trans Samudera' departed Chattogram Port today (October 19, 2022) carrying Indian transit container that was transported from the Indian state of Meghalaya via Bangladesh.This is part of the trial runs being undertaken for the operationalisation of the agreement to use Chattogram and Mongla Ports for the transit of goods to and from India which was signed between Indian and Bangladesh in 2018.The trial run is being undertaken by Tata Steel and CJ Darcl Logistics Ltd on the route Dawki–Tamabil–Chattogram.There are eight approved routes for transit of goods under the agreement. Those include Chattogram/Mongla Port to Agartala via Akhaura, Chattogram/Mongla Port to Dawki via Tamabil, Chattogram/Mongla Port to Sutarkandi via Sheola, Chattogram/Mongla Port to Srimantapur via Bibirbazar and vice versa on all four routes.During the visit Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India in 2019, a standard operating procedure (SOP) was signed to operationalize the agreement.The first trial movement under this agreement on the route Chattogram-Akhaura-Agartala was successfully conducted in July 2020 wherein four containers, two each of TMT steel and pulses, were delivered at ICP Agartala from Kolkata through Chattogram.""The transit/transshipment of goods under this agreement will reduce both cost and time for transport of goods to Northeastern States of India. It will also create economic gains for the Bangladesh logistics and services industry (Insurance, transport and Finance industry etc) as only Bangladesh trucks will be used for transshipment,"" said a statement of the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.This trial run marks the completion of all trial runs on all approved routes under the agreement. Following completion of trial runs, necessary permanent standing order or notification would now be issued by Bangladesh government for operationalising regular movement of goods under this agreement.""This is a step forward in realising the commitment reiterated at the level of the two Prime Ministers during the visit of Hon'ble Prime of Bangladesh to India in September 2022."""

/opinion/views/news/ditching-the-growth-plan-may-not-save-pm-truss-3146876,Ditching the growth plan may not save PM Truss,"Famous for satirical headlines, British tabloids are having a field day due to the UK's tumultuous politics, which is equally brutal. One of them – the namesake of this paper – has been betting Prime Minister Liz Truss' tenure with the shelf life of lettuce for a couple of days. Its front page on Monday also featured an image of a lettuce head bought from Tesco, to see if it can outlast Ms Truss' premiership, and there's a livestream where readers can watch the vegetable's progress, too. For those who have a habit of discarding tabloid headlines as gossip, there's no respite from speculations either. The Conservative-supporting press, too, such as The Sunday Times, has advised the Tories that it would be ""astute"" to let the Labour Party ""confront the economic challenges"" ahead. The Economist has also suggested that Liz Truss' premiership could very well be the shortest one in modern British history.Political pundits and the media were remarkably unanimous that her sacking of Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng was nothing but buying off a little more time for herself as his so-called mini-budget that rattled the financial markets was drawn fully on her pro-growth economic promises she had made during her leadership campaign. The reactions to her tax plan in the market and other major economies were quite sharp and harsh. Markets saw her tax cuts unaffordable, which simultaneously weakened the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of borrowing for the government.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) weighed into the debate on the issue of unfunded tax cuts and called for reversal of such policies. For the UK, as a member of G7, the club of industrialised nations, it is quite unusual to be publicly lectured by the IMF. And then came criticisms from its allies, including the US. Following the market turmoil, President Joe Biden said the outcome was ""predictable"" and ""I wasn't the only one that thought it was a mistake."" He added that he had disagreed with ""the idea of cutting taxes on the super wealthy,"" but it was up to the UK to ""make that judgement, not me.""Since assuming the office, the newly appointed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has announced a series of U-turns of the government policies, including scrapping the top income tax rate, and a freeze on corporation tax. To calm the markets, he had to make a Monday morning statement over a live broadcast, instead of unveiling it in parliament as per the tradition, in which he scrapped all those tax cuts announced in the ""growth plan"" by his predecessor a few weeks back.These assertive measures of the new chancellor, however, have been greeted by the media and political observers as a sign of further waning of Prime Minister Liz Truss' authority. In anticipation of Jeremy Hunt's announcement, The Sunday Times wrote that the new chancellor had taken ""full control"" by delaying the prime minister's flagship 1p cut to income tax by a year. It also said Hunt's self-proclaimed ""clean slate"" on the mini-budget would add to the sense among some Tories that the prime minister was ""increasingly powerless."" Another Tory-friendly weekend paper, The Sunday Telegraph, wrote, ""Good news for the economy may mean bad news for Ms Truss."" The paper quoted an unnamed senior Conservative as saying, ""She's in office, he's [Hunt's] in power. That's why she's got to go.""The dwindling authority of the prime minister means more speculation and potential plotting for change in leadership. Weekend papers have suggested that Liz Truss' former leadership rival Rishi Sunak is ready to replace her, if asked. The Daily Mirror reports that the ""rattled"" Conservatives want Defence Secretary Ben Wallace to replace Ms Truss as the prime minister. Staunch Conservative-supporting The Sunday Express reports of a ""secret plot to oust"" Truss, claiming it's been told that around 100 MPs are backing a plan to bring the prime minister's ""'catastrophic' stint in No 10 to an end and appoint her successor without a contest."" Some observers believe party grandies will prefer crowning the new chancellor as an interim leader, instead of another bruising leadership contest.Opposition parties have demanded a new general election as the main contender, the Labour Party, has been maintaining quite a significant lead over the Conservatives since the unceremonious exit of Boris Johnson. However, Conservative MPs are terrified about the likely electoral disaster, which makes it more likely that if and when Liz Truss is forced out, a replacement would be found.The current party rules prevent a formal leadership challenge for a year following a leadership election or a confidence vote among the MPs. But, if the majority of party MPs submit no-confidence letters to the chair of the back-bench members body known as the 1992 committee, then that could force a rule change and even allow the MPs to bypass party members and elect a new leader themselves.A handful of MPs in the party have already broken cover to call for Liz Truss to go. Her premiership may very well outlast a lettuce head, but securing it till the next election remains uncertain. Kamal Ahmed is an independent journalist and writes from London, UK.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/poran-completes-its-century-theatres-3146676,‘Poran’ completes its century in theatres,"Raihan Rafi's ""Poran"" has created history by completing its hundred-day run at the theatres. The film is still running successfully in 11 theaters in the country, including the multiplexes. It has set an exemplary record for the Bangladeshi film industry by maintaining a century run at most of the theatres.Bangladesh doesn't have any box office records, and thus it is difficult hard to find out the daily or weekly income. Film distributors or producers do not disclose the actual earnings. However, an exception has occurred in terms of ""Poran"", as its production and distribution company has given an approximate account of the films' revenue which was received across the theatres of the country.According to reports, a rough estimate of their 100-day earnings has been collected. Avi Kathachitra, a film distribution company, is yet to get the full account of one hundred days. However, as per the ticket sales from all over the country, the film has earned a massive BDT 12 crores.Star Cineplex was able to earn a massive amount of profit through ticket revenues of ""Poran"". All five outlets of Star Cineplex Dhaka have sold about BDT 7 crores and 22 lakhs worth of tickets till October 10. Jamuna Blockbuster Cinemas also sold tickets worth around Tk 2 crore till September 30.Lion Cinemas has earned almost BDT50 lakhs from ticket sales. ""Poran '' has been running for 86 days at Purobi Cinema Hall in Mymensingh, even with a break of two weeks. A total of BDT 14 lakh tickets were sold in this hall till last October 14.Apart from this, more than BDT 3 crores came from various single halls in Dhaka and outside. About 3 crores came to the producer from the total amount of ticket sales after sharing with the hall owner excluding VAT and tax. At the time of the release of the film, it was known from the producer sources that the film ""Poran"" had a budget of BDT 87 lakhs taka including publicity costs.Zahid Hossain, the distributor of the film, told Prothom Alo that the total amount of hundred days will take some time to be fully accounted for, as they believe that the number of ticket sales will increase in the future. According to the distributor, ten shows are still running daily in five branches of Cineplex, three in Blockbuster Cinemas, two each in Lion Cinemas, and Chittagong Silver Screen.Some shows of ""Poran"" are still going housefuls every day at the Cineplex. The film is still being screened in a few single halls outside Dhaka. In this situation, it is difficult to say how many more days the film will run in the theaters of the country. The distributors have hope that the ticket sales of ""Poran"" might cross BDT 15 crores at the theatres.Raihan Rafi's film romantic tragedy film ""Poran"" was released on July 10. The film was also released in the US, Canada, and Paris. The film stars Sariful Razz, Bidya Sinha Mim, and Yash Rohan in pivotal roles. "

Assuming 50 percent more project cost in Bangladesh, around 6.5 gigawatt could still be installed with $11 billion, which Bangladesh might have to spend on spot market LNG purchase in just three years.""Bangladesh can turn the current power crisis caused by the spiralling gas prices into an opportunity. Redirecting its efforts to ramp up renewable energy capacity and grid augmentation investments now can solve so many problems,"" said Aditya Lolla, senior electricity policy analyst of Ember, in the analysis published earlier this month.Such an approach will embolden Bangladesh's stance in climate change negotiation. It will also reduce the country's reliance on expensive LNG imports, offer protection from global fossil energy price fluctuations, reduce the fiscal burden on the government and improve overall energy security, the report said.Ember data show electricity demand in the country saw a rise on an average of 8 percent annually. Of the demand, 62 percent was met by gas power, while its renewable energy production accounted for only 1 percent of the country's total power generation.""The Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan published in 2021 laid out ambitious solar targets. Had this plan been fully implemented, additional solar generation could have reduced these imports by 25 percent between 2022 and 2024, saving about $2.7 billion,"" Ember's report said.Bangladesh's Energy and Mineral Resources Division data show that by financial year 2021-2022, LNG imports accounted for 22 percent of the country's total gas requirement.On the other hand, IEEFA's (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis) recent analysis shows about 59 percent of its LNG imports come from the spot market, exposing the sector to volatile prices.Before the government decided to stop purchasing liquified natural gas from the international spot market in June, Petrobangla was supplying over 3,000 mmcfd (million cubic feet per day) gas to the national grid. The portion of LNG was over 770 mmcfd on average in June, which stood at 470-480 mmcfd since July.Recently, the LNG price on the spot market has decreased, standing at under $40 per MMbtu (metric million British thermal unit) now, according to Petrobangla officials. Petrobangla Chairman Nazmul Ahsan told The Daily Star that they were not thinking about buying LNG from the spot market again until the price came down.""The share of LNG from the spot market is about 10 percent of the total supply,"" he said and hoped that there would be no need to buy LNG from the spot market in the near future.In 2021-22, the government spent Tk 7,614 crore to buy the 10 percent LNG from the spot market, whereas the 75 percent local gas production cost only Tk 5,196 crore, according to Petrobangla data.In 2021-22, the government imported 18 shiploads of LNG from the spot market against its plan for importing 30 cargoes.Contacted, Mir Mohammad Aslam Uddin Khan, deputy chief information officer of the energy ministry, told The Daily Star that currently the share of solar power production is 971 megawatts in the country.""But we have more than 4,000 megawatts in the pipeline. The problem we face when planning for solar power is scarcity of land. Many initiatives linger due to land shortages. As the potential of solar power is abundant in the country, we are looking for a way out to solve the land crisis,"" he said."
/chattogram/news/chattogram-city-fading-greenery-3146496,Chattogram: A city of fading greenery,"Once upon a time, the country's port city was celebrated for its lush vegetation and green hills. However, in the last three decades, the city has already lost half its greenery to unchecked, unplanned urbanisation.A study by the Department of Geography and Environment at Dhaka University has found that the green cover of Chattogram city, which was 68.34 percent in 1990, has gone down to 36.51 percent over the last 30 years. This translates to a 46.57 percent decline.The study, titled ""Green space dynamics in response to rapid urbanisation: Patterns, transformations and topographic influence in Chattogram City"" was authored by Sumaiya Siddique and Md Mahin Uddin -- two master's students from the department.The study found that housing construction has significantly gone up in the last three decades, leaping from 21.84 percent in 1990 to 53.98 percent in 2020.Mahin Uddin, one of the authors of the study, told The Daily Star that smaller and less steep hills suffered the most losses.""Usually, the elevation that is less than 13 metres lost the greenest space while vegetation of the high to the highest elevation has faced less harm,"" he said.Sumaiya Siddique, another author of the study, said, ""All types of green spaces in Chattogram city have undergone loss in the study period 1990–2020 with 9.9 percent forest cover loss, 7.6 percent agricultural land loss and vegetation cover loss of 14.3 percent.The study, which assessed 167 square kilometres of the city, found that the growing demands of the urban population are straining the city's forest and vegetation, leading to the fragmentation of green spaces, she said.""Chattogram is economically thriving but at a cost. Economic development has brought an enormous number of migrants to the city, leading to haphazard growth and depletion of green spaces,"" Mahin said.Contacted, Sharif Chowhan, president of People's Voice, a civil platform for the conservation of hills in Chattogram, said whoever has come to power patronised people who cut hills for various commercial purposes.""Areas like Arefin Nagar, Lalkhan Bazar, Roufabad, Chandranagar, Akbar Shah and Tiger Pass -- once an undulating hilly landscape -- have now been grabbed by ruling party men because of the regulatory body's inaction. The canals too, have been encroached upon and are of no use. Now the rivers are also being targeted. The government must put an end to this to protect the greenery of Chattogram,"" he said.Eminent poet and educationist Abul Momen, who has been living in Chattogram since his birth in 1948, said Chattogram was a city of hills and green valleys during his childhood and had an abundance of trees.""The first attack on the hills, to the best of my knowledge, was in 1960 during the then Ayub Khan regime to build a stadium in Kazir Dewri area. But it was at a tolerable level,"" he said.""The massive razing of hills started during the boom of the real estate business in the 80s. Housing construction and shopping malls took over the hilly areas,"" he added.He urged the government to come forward to protect the few hills left in the city. Otherwise, those too will be lost to the greed of the rich and influential, he said.Asked, Mofidul Alam, director of the Department of Environment, Chattogram, said they had sent a proposal to the DoE headquarters to survey the hills of the port city.""The proposal is not approved yet. Once approved, we will look into how many hills have disappeared and how many are left. The survey will help get the accurate data to deal with the loss of green space,"" he said."
