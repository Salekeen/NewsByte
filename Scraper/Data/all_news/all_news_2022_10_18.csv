/business/economy/opinion/news/correcting-course-accelerate-poverty-reduction-3145851,Correcting course to accelerate poverty reduction,"On End Poverty Day this year, it's hard to find cause for celebration.  The Covid-19 pandemic triggered a historic setback, pushing 70 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 – the largest one-year increase in three decades. The war in Ukraine deepened the global economic slowdown, which is now in its steepest decline following a post-recession recovery since 1970. At this rate, nearly 7 per cent of the world's population – almost 600 million people – will still be struggling in extreme poverty in 2030.  Whilst the picture is sobering, it is a wake-up call for us to think and act to correct course. It's important to remember that many of the development challenges we face today did not start with the pandemic.Riding on the momentum to build back better, it's a good time to review deficiencies of past policies and underinvestment.   We must correct course now across a comprehensive range of policies and step-up global cooperation for a lasting recovery to move towards green, resilient, and inclusive development. In any crisis, it is the poor that are hit hardest. According to the latest World Bank analysis, the poorest people bore the steepest costs of the Covid-19 pandemic: income losses averaged 4 per cent for the poorest 40 per cent, double the losses of the wealthiest 20 per cent of the income distribution.  It is the poor who do not have the resources to cope.During the pandemic, strong fiscal policy measures did help to protect poor and vulnerable people, but poor countries were less successful than rich countries. With less to spend, low- and lower-middle income economies offset barely a quarter of the impact on poverty.What may be even more worrying are the long-term consequences of multiple overlapping crises, which could worsen poverty in the near future if we do not accelerate action.  Losses in learning and human capital, as well as climate change are among the most critical.Losses in Learning and human capital: As a result of prolonged school closures and shocks to household incomes during the pandemic, learning poverty has increased by a third in low- and middle-income countries. This means that an estimated 70 per cent of 10-year-olds are unable to understand a simple written text.Today's students could lose 10 per cent of their future average annual earnings as a result. Youth have also suffered a loss in human capital, in terms of both skills and jobs. Short-term declines in youth employment can lead to more frequent unemployment spells, lower future wages, and increased social unrest. Beyond reducing incomes, the decline in human capital will lead to lower productivity and less inclusion for decades to come, hindering growth, increasing poverty and inequality.These trends can be reversed if countries act quickly and decisively, guided by evidence on what works. We must keep schools open, assess students and match instruction to their levels, streamline the curriculum and focus on foundations - especially literacy, numeracy, and core socioemotional skills.And we need to create a national political commitment for learning recovery, guided by credible measurement of learning. We must not forget to invest in girls' education – which may well be the highest-return investment available in the developing world.Climate change: The climate crisis is already here, and it could push an additional 132 million people into poverty by 2030.  The adverse consequences of climate change—water scarcity, crop failure, food insecurity, economic shocks, migration, and displacement— can multiply threats by exacerbating conflict, reducing economic opportunities and social cohesion, as well as straining public institutions.We need to make sure that climate is integrated into development and ensure a well-managed 'just' transition towards clean energy sources in a way that protects people, communities, and the environment.  Developing countries face a triple penalty – they pay more to provide electricity services; they are locked out of economical clean energy projects; and they are locked-in to fossil fuel projects with high and volatile variable costs. We will need impactful programs and projects, adequate public policies, and significantly increased funding from multiple sources. Countries need to also invest in adaptation and resilience.A resilient recovery will depend on a wide range of policies, including fiscal reforms that reorient spending away from subsidies toward support targeted to poor and vulnerable groups, and improvements in efficiency and efficacy.  Prioritizing long-term growth requires appropriate investments in crisis readiness, too. Covi-19 showed us how progress achieved over decades can vanish overnight when such readiness is lacking.Public investments that support long-run development, such as investments in human capital of young people or investments in infrastructure as well as research and development can have a positive impact on growth, inequality and poverty decades later.We must respond to current challenges in ways that do not further impoverish the poor today and focus on creating opportunities that they can enjoy tomorrow.The author is the managing director of development policy and partnerships of the World Bank"

Yesterday, he came to the office to collect his personal belongings.""There must be some reasons. The state might have the answers,"" said Mokbul, adding that he conveyed the matter to Information Minister Hasan Mahmud the same day.The public administration ministry issued a circular saying Mokbul was sent into retirement under Section 45 of Bangladesh Service Rules 2018.Upon the president's approval, the government can send an employee, who has completed 25 years of service, into retirement in public interest, without showing any reasons, according to the section.Mokbul said, ""Parents admonish their children first and then punish them. If I had been involved in any wrongdoing, I should have been cautioned for that. I would have corrected myself … the decision could have been taken if I had failed to rectify myself.""Some day you will learn why the decision was taken.""Seeking anonymity, an information ministry official told The Daily Star that the minister and the secretary have not been on good terms lately.""The minister was unhappy. But I cannot say for sure whether the minister's unhappiness led to the forced retirement of Mokbul Hossain,"" said the official, adding that the decision would create a bad precedent in the civil service.Mokbul observed the government made the decision within the legal framework, and that he was not considering taking any legal steps.""I have served the country enough. I respect the decision of the government,"" he said.There has been an allegation that the action was taken against him as he met BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman in London.About the allegation, Mokbul said, ""I went to London with a team in March. Ashequn Nabi Chowdhury [press minister at Bangladesh High Commission in London] was in-charge of the press wing. If you [journalists] ask him, you will get to know the facts.""If the allegation is true, it [the meeting with Tarique] happened in March. This is October. Why this question wasn't asked all these months?""I don't remember whether I have ever seen Tarique Rahman in person … I have no wish to meet him either.""Asked if he had met Tarique during the BNP government's tenures, he said they never met. ""He was neither a minister nor a lawmaker. I saw him only on television …He added, ""Until today [Monday], I was not aware of any allegations against me. Now, all these allegations are surfacing.""Moments before Mokbul talked to the media, the information minister said he was still unaware of the reasons behind the secretary's forced retirement.""I don't know the underlying reasons behind it. Since the public administration ministry issued the circular, it can explain better,""he said, skirting a direct answer.Earlier in 2009, the government sent the then information secretary ATM Fazlul Karim into forced retirement for writing a poem demeaning Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members.Mokbul joined as the secretary of the information and broadcasting ministry on May 31, 2021.Earlier, he had worked as a registrar at the office of the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms. He also worked as an additional secretary at the textiles and jute ministry.He joined Bangladesh Civil Service in 1991 as an officer of the 10th batch of the BCS (administration) cadre. He worked in administration for most of his career."

So polite you could almost have missed it,"" wrote left-wing broadsheet The Guardian.Conservative MP Roger Gale said that Hunt had become ""de facto prime minister"" as several MPs publicly urged her to go and others reportedly plotted to unseat her.""I think her position is untenable,"" Conservative MP Charles Walker told Sky News.""If she doesn't go right now, it will not be her decision,"" he warned.Armed forces minister James Heappey assured British media on Tuesday morning that Truss had ""owned"" her mistake, while admitting she could not repeat such errors.Asked by Sky News whether Truss was ""prime minister in name only"", Heappey insisted: ""She's been very candid about the mistake that was made and she has apologised for that... There's leadership in doing that"".But he conceded that ""given how skittish our politics are... I don't think that there's the opportunity to make any more mistakes.""Truss fired her close friend Kwarteng on Friday after their tax-slashing budget sent bond yields spiking and the pound collapsing to a record dollar-low on fears of rocketing UK debt -- fuelling intense speculation over her political future one month after taking office.Truss had already staged two embarrassing budget U-turns, scrapping tax cuts for the richest earners and on company profits.Hunt's strategy reversals included reducing Truss's announced £2,500 cap on energy bills for all British people from two years to six months, after which he promised a new approach.Hunt estimated the tax changes would raise about £32 billion ($36 billion) per year, after economists estimated the government faced a £60-billion black hole. He also warned of tough spending cuts.Hunt's actions on Monday sent the British pound soaring against the dollar and euro, while bond yields dipped."

It may bring $10 billion for Bangladesh,"" he told The Daily Star in an interview.""When we go physically to meet global clients and pitch about Bangladesh, confidence grows among them about our IT industry. It's more effective that the virtual communication,"" he said.Ahmed said a BASIS delegation recently visited Austria, Hungary and the UK to increase export of homemade software.""We met about 300 IT businessmen in the events in those countries and we are able to make at least 30 of them an ambassador of the country's IT industry,"" he said.Russell T Ahmed said a BASIS delegation recently visited Austria, Hungary and the UK to increase export of homemade software


Russell T Ahmed said a BASIS delegation recently visited Austria, Hungary and the UK to increase export of homemade softwareA ""Festival of Sourcing"" has been held in the UK for 35 years and the BASIS was given the offer to become the title partner this year and have the name of the event turned to ""Sourcing festival in association with BASIS"".""When the offer came to us, we jumped at the chance. The entire venue was decorated with flags of Bangladesh and BASIS. It was a great opportunity for us to highlight the capabilities of the country's software sector at a world forum,"" said Ahmed.He said after talking to top executives of the European IT firms they realised that there are a lot of opportunities for Bangladeshi tech firms and global IT firms have a lot of new jobs and requirements,"" he said.""For some circumstances, they are searching for an alternative to India, which is a top ICT service exporter with annual exports of $226 billion,"" said the BASIS president.Indian firms are big and they like to take on big projects. So, when a project needs a few software developers, Indian companies do not show interest. So, there is a vacuum for manpower to accomplish small and medium projects, he said.But the challenge is that although they know Bangladesh has a growing economy, they do not know Bangladesh as an ICT destination. When they are searching for an alternate destination, there is no presence of Bangladesh in their map, said Ahmed.""So, we urgently need to promote the local IT industry to different markets…still untapped. And without government help, it's difficult for the industry to fund it alone,"" he added.According to the BASIS, 34 per cent of software developed in the country was exported to the US and 13 per cent to the UK.To European countries, it is only 4 per cent to 5 per cent, in spite of the fact that Bangladesh has potential to export more.Currently producing around 20,000 IT graduates annually, Bangladesh has set an IT export target of $5 billion by 2025.""Business has an organic growth and Bangladesh will attain the $5 billion ICT export target at one point. But we need a big push to achieve more. Because we must move aggressively to grasp the opportunity,"" said Ahmed.Aside from the tapping into India's share of the market, the war in Ukraine, which is a big IT service exporter, has also paved a way for boosting ICT exports as many clients are seeking alternatives, he added.""So, we shouldn't miss it. A coordinated campaign by the government and the industry for the local IT industry promotion has become essential,"" he said. "
/tech-startup/science-gadgets-and-tech/news/why-do-we-age-3145701,Why do we age?,"Why do we get old? This question has been troubling humans for thousands of years. Sadly, there is no definite answer yet — but here's what we know so far.As we age, many of the systems in our bodies begin to deteriorate: Our vision gets worse, our joints weaker and our skin thinner. The older we get, the more likely we are to become ill, break bones and — eventually — die.Our reproductive success, which describes an individual's production of offspring per lifetime, also declines as we age, Thomas Flatt, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Freiburg, told DW. ""This is what happens to most organisms,"" he said.""Evolution by natural selection is very much about how many viable offspring you can produce,"" said Flatt. The more viable offspring you produce, the more genes will be passed on — it's all about maximizing reproduction.Better genes are those that increase your reproductive success. Over generations, those genes are likely to become more common in the population.Natural selection gets weaker as organisms ageThis means that whatever happens after you reproduce has little effect on how well you pass on your genes to the next generation, which is key to understanding evolution.Whether you are in a good or bad state when you get old doesn't really matter, because you won't be able to produce offspring.Humans in the past, and most organisms that live in the wild, typically don't reach old age because of the dangerous environments they grow up in.This means that natural selection gets weaker in organisms as they age.""To put it bluntly, organisms that are very old are, from an evolutionary perspective, worthless,"" said Flatt.Now imagine that by pure chance you inherit a dangerous mutation that will cause negative effects as you age. Although you most likely wouldn't live long enough to experience those bad effects, the mutation would remain in your genome, so you would still be able to pass it on to your offspring.This is happening all the time. Over generations, many mutations that make old age worse are accumulating in our genomes.Huntington's disease is thought to be an example of this accumulation of negative mutations. This deadly disease has an onset age of around 35 years.There is also evidence that natural selection can favor some mutations that can have a positive effect at early age but negative effects when you get older, according to an article published by Flatt and Linda Partridge in BMC Biology.An example of this includes mutations in the BRCA1/2 gene that increase a woman's fertility — and the risk of women developing breast and ovarian cancer.So what happens when modern medicine and improved diets, hygiene and living conditions allow us to live much longer? We live to ages in which we can experience all those negative effects.If we look at nature, aging is a very diverse process. Some organisms simply don't seem to get old at all. Hydras are freshwater polyps, related to jellyfish and corals, that never seem to age and are potentially immortal.There are also many plants that don't show any signs of aging, and some trees, like the Great Basin bristlecone pine, that can live for thousands of years. One of these pines, named Methuselah, is almost 5,000 years old.Another fascinating example is the Greenland shark. It reaches sexual maturity at age 150 and can live up to 400 years, giving it the longest lifespan of all vertebrates.On the contrary, and perhaps to the delight of many, a female mosquito — the kind that bite you in your sleep — only lives about 50 days.We still don't know why these huge differences in aging and lifespan exist, but part of the answer is related to evolution. For different organisms, environmental pressures might have favored faster maturity and reproduction and shorter lifespan, while others favored the contrary.""Animals that have a high risk of dying normally have a short lifespan, which of course makes sense, because if you have a very high risk to die anyway, you don't need to invest in living very long,"" Sebastian Grönke, a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Aging, told DW. ""You rather invest in reproducing fast so that you can reproduce before you die."""
/health/disease/news/rising-dengue-cases-call-urgent-action-3145251,Rising dengue cases call for urgent action,"With the number of dengue cases soaring every day across the country, hospitals especially those in the capital are struggling to deal with the patients, health officials say while experts suggest immediate steps to control Aedes mosquitoes.According to the data of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), at least 857 new dengue patients were hospitalised across the country in 24 hours till yesterday morning, which is this year's daily highest.Two patients also died yesterday, taking this year's dengue death toll to 96, the third annual highest since the first outbreak of dengue in the country in 2000.""We are struggling with dengue patients every day due to the surge in cases since last week,"" said HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital.""Now we have to send back some patients from the hospital due to scarcity of seats.""The dedicated ward for dengue patients in this major public hospital has already been filled up and the authorities have arranged some extra beds but that's still not enough against the demand, he added.According to Secretary of Health Services Division Anwar Hossain Hawlader, the number of dengue patients is surpassing the capacity of all public hospitals in Dhaka, and the situation may go out of control if it is not checked immediately.""The dengue cases are breaking all records, stretching the hospitals to their limit. There is no bed left vacant for dengue patients in the city's public hospitals,"" Anwar said while briefing reporters at the health directorate.""But we cannot refuse services to anyone. We have to manage somehow,"" he said, adding that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Affairs does not want any crisis like in 2019.A total of 1,01,354 dengue cases, the annual highest, were recorded that year when the death toll was 179.The secretary said all hospitals have to introduce separate units for dengue patients and ensure the supply of necessary fluids. They have also asked the city corporations to conduct drives in the dengue hotspots.Ashraful Alam, assistant director of the country's top public healthcare facility Dhaka Medical College Hospital, said the number of dengue patients is rising every day though the ""situation is still not at danger level"".Mohammad Ali Habib, deputy director of Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital, said though the number of dengue patients is increasing, they did not open any separate dengue wards as ""it is still manageable"".In Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute, the number of patients was only 40 about 15 days back, but it was 85 as of yesterday afternoon, said Abdul Hakim, its public relations officer.""We are increasing the number of beds every day and have made two separate wards dedicated to dengue patients,"" he said.Entomologist Prof Kabirul Bashar of Jahangirnagar University said every year in October, dengue cases start going down. But this time, the rising trend continues.It is not possible to control dengue without managing the hotspots. This year, the authorities took inadequate measures to find and manage these sites, he also said.""Hotspot management means identifying risky houses and areas by collecting addresses of dengue patients,"" he explained.Brig Gen Md Zobaidur Rahman, Dhaka North City Corporation's chief health officer, recently said apart from regular and special drives, they have purchased 30 boats to clean water bodies and use insecticides properly.Md Abu Nasher, public relations officer of Dhaka South City Corporation, said they are taking different special measures, besides the routine works, including drives around houses of dengue patients.Multiple exposures to dengue, late admission in hospitals and late diagnosis of the deadly virus are the main reasons for increasing dengue deaths, said experts.Tahmina Shirin, director of Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), said three variants of dengue virus -- DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 -- are active in Bangladesh this year.  Of them, DENV-3 is infecting people the most.Tahmina emphasised the need for awareness campaigns involving councillors or locally influential persons to control Aedes mosquitoes in an area.She also suggested taking sufficient fluids in any form like oral saline, fruit juice, sorbet and coconut water when anyone has a fever, which is a major symptom of dengue.""A patient will take fluids during fever and also continue it even after the fever goes away as there will be the chance of deterioration after fever ends,"" she said.The patients need to be hospitalised when they will feel vomiting, pain in the belly, breathing problems or will bleed from any parts of the body, she advised.Nazmul Ahsan of Suhrawardy hospital said the patients who are coming to the facility have mostly faced multiple exposures. It means they were infected by another variant of the dengue virus earlier.If a person who was previously infected with one of the variants contracts dengue because of a different variant, the risk of mortality can also go up. But early detection of the infection and immediate hospitalisation can significantly lower the risk.Late admission is another reason for the rising number of deaths this year, Nazmul said.""Many dengue patients, mostly facing multiple exposures, delay getting admitted to hospitals as they are not diagnosed dengue initially through NS1 kit. By the time they are hospitalised, the illness reached a severe stage.""Many hospitals or clinics, especially private ones, do not follow guidelines on fluid management, he said, adding that this is another reason for increasing deaths."

They then entered Iraq illegally, said CTTC officials, citing the investigation findings.In Iraq, they met Sohrab and started working together in a diagnostic centre.Their monthly salary was equivalent to USD 400.Sohrab had been staying in Iraq since 2018.Because they had no work permit or valid documents in Iraq and their employer confiscated their passports, these migrants could not go out of the country.The employer would often torture them and not pay their salaries regularly, claimed the arrestees during primary interrogation.Desperate, the three decided to make an illegal journey to Italy for a better future.As per the plan, they broke into their employer Dr Ali Ahmmed's office to get the passports.During that time, they also looted money worth around USD 1.43 lakh and started their journey to Italy.For the journey, they communicated with another trafficking syndicate in Iraq and paid it an amount equivalent to around USD 17,000.Mid-journey, when they were trying to go to Turkey's Istanbul from Iraq by road, the three were detained by the Turkish police at a check-post.The Turkish police then arrested the group and deported them on Saturday, after a 17-day stay in jail there, according to the CTTC officials.After CTTC made the arrests, a case was filed with Airport Police Station, and the three were sent to jail.Meanwhile, Sohrab gave a confessional statement to a Dhaka court on Sunday, said the investigatorsAs the three had already lost their savings to go abroad, they decided to steal the money to go to Italy, said police, quoting the arrestees.ADC Tohidul said before leaving Iraq, the group gave the looted money to a friend, who was supposed to send it to their families back in Bangladesh through hundi.But the friend, Al-Amin, was yet to send the money, and his cell phone was found switched off, he said.Police are now trying to recover the money by tracing Al-Amin's location.ADC Tohidul said two Bangladeshis run both trafficking syndicates.One Reaz from Noakhali leads a syndicate and sends people to Iraq illegally after acquiring visiting visas for Dubai, said the official.ADC Tohidul said one Sajib from Brahmanbaria, along with Iraqis, runs the syndicate in Iraq.""We are now investigating these syndicates' activities to know how many migrants they have trafficked abrd,"" he said.Tohidul further said Bangladeshi members of the syndicates are hiding somewhere in the country. ""We are conducting a drive to arrest them."""
/world/europe/news/fat-parrot-banned-beauty-contest-3145311,‘Fat’ parrot banned from beauty contest,"The world's fattest parrot can't fly, and now it can't run either.Voting began on Monday in New Zealand's always-controversial Bird of the Year contest, with angry twitchers spitting feathers at a decision to ban the twice-winning kakapo.The beguiling owl parrot -- which resembles a verdant feathered bowling ball -- already won the contest in 2008 and 2020, and came runner up in 2021.The kakapo was a favourite to win this year, scoring an endorsement from natural history icon David Attenborough, who described it as ""loveable"" and his favourite New Zealand bird.But faced with a campaign of such soaring pedigree, organisers said they wanted to give less popular birds a chance.""The decision to leave kakapo off this year's candidate list wasn't one we took lightly,"" Ellen Rykers, a spokesperson for environmental group Forest and Bird, told AFP.""We know how much people love the kakapo. Bird of the Year is about raising awareness for all of New Zealand's native birds, many of which are in serious trouble,"" she said.""We want to keep the competition fresh and interesting, and share some of the spotlight,"" Rykers added.""It wouldn't be Bird of the Year without a few ruffled feathers.""New Zealand's Bird of the Year contest has proven highly contentious over the years.Past polls have been beset with irregularities -- from a suspicious number of Russian votes, to neighbouring Australians openly attempting to rig the contest.The reigning champion is the pekapeka-tou-roa -- a bat.This time around, Facebook pages have been set up to champion the takahe, described by fans as a ""chonky swamp hen"" and the kea -- which also looks like a verdant feathered bowling ball.The kakapo, nocturnal and endangered, is unique to New Zealand and can weigh up to four kilograms (8.8 pounds), as much as a newborn human child.Having previously teetered on the brink of extinction, the kakapo have recently had their best breeding season for 50 years, lifting their numbers from 197 to 252. "
/sports/football/news/i-sign-what-my-father-tells-me-3145906,‘I sign what my father tells me to’,"Brazil superstar Neymar said Tuesday his manager father always handled his contracts as he took the stand at his trial in Spain over alleged irregularities in his transfer to Barcelona in 2013.""My father has always been in charge"" of contract negotiations, the 30-year-old told the Barcelona court hearing the case. ""I sign what he tells me to.""He also said he did not remember if he took part in the negotiations which led to an agreement sealed in 2011 with Barcelona over his transfer two years later to the Catalan side from Brazilian club Santos.Spanish prosecutors are seeking a two-year prison term for Neymar, a key member of the Brazil team that will be heading to the World Cup in Qatar next month, and the payment of a 10-million-euro ($9.7 million) fine.The trial is the culmination of a years-long legal saga over Neymar's 2013 move from Santos to Barcelona.He then joined Qatar-owned PSG in a world record 222-million-euro transfer in 2017.Neymar is one of nine defendants on trial on corruption-related charges, among them his parents and their N&N company, which manages his affairs.He had originally been set to testify on either October 21 or 28 but the Barcelona court hearing the case agreed to bring forward his hearing to avoid a clash with his commitments with PSG.'Complicity to defraud' The player spent two hours at the court on Monday on the opening day of the trial before he was excused by the judge after his lawyers argued he needed to rest after playing Sunday night.The player scored the only goal of the Ligue 1 match against Marseille.Investigators began probing the transfer after a 2015 complaint filed by DIS, a Brazilian company that owned 40 percent of the player's sporting rights when he was at Santos.Barcelona said the transfer cost 57.1 million euros, but prosecutors believe it was at least 83 million euros.The club said it paid 40 million euros to N&N and 17.1 million to Santos, of which 6.8 million was given to DIS.But DIS alleges that Neymar, Barcelona and the Brazilian club colluded to mask the true cost of the deal.Among the other defendants are two former Barca presidents, Sandro Rosell and Josep Maria Bartomeu, and ex-Santos boss Odilio Rodrigues Filho.DIS is seeking to recover 35 million euros.The company's lawyer Paulo Nasser said last week that Neymar had ""with the complicity of his parents and FC Barcelona and its directors at the time, and Santos FC at a later stage, defrauded DIS of its legitimate financial interests.""-'Legal signing bonus' Neymar's lawyers insist their client is innocent, saying the 40 million euros was a ""legal signing bonus which is normal in the football transfer market"".They have said Spanish authorities lack jurisdiction to hear the case since the transfer involved Brazilian nationals in Brazil.The trial is due to end on October 31.Neymar's abrupt departure for PSG five years ago sparked a string of legal disputes, with Barcelona withholding its contract extension bonus and suing the player for breach of contract, as Neymar countersued.Both sides eventually reached an ""amicable"" out-of-court settlement in 2021.The footballer is having one of his best seasons since he joined PSG.His goal against Marseille on Sunday was his ninth league goal of the season, and he has seven assists in 11 Ligue 1 matches.Neymar is expected to play a key role for Brazil at the World Cup in Qatar, as the South American giants seek to win the trophy for the first time since 2002, and the sixth in total.He will lead the Selecao into their Group G opener against Serbia on November 24.

""The most special moment was without doubt playing the two games at Camp Nou,"" said Putellas. ""I was able to fulfil the dream of any Barca fan.""Putellas finished as the competition's top goalscorer with 11 and took home the player of the tournament award, followed by the UEFA player of the year in August.Despite the disappointment of defeat Putellas, the first Spain women's player to reach 100 caps, headed into the Euros with her country among the favourites, but suffered her knee injury in training.La Roja, missing Putellas's creativity, were eliminated in extra-time by England and are now setting their sights on the World Cup in July 2022, although her participation is in doubt -- and not just due to injury.The Barcelona captain showed her leadership by publishing a statement calling for change, along with 15 national team players who asked not to be called up by Spain, amid differences with the coach Jorge Vilda and Spanish football federation.Although injured and unavailable for selection, Putellas posted the message on Twitter in solidarity with her team-mates, who were not part of the team's recent matches.The stance marks her out, along with the two prior winners of the award, Norway's Ada Hegerberg and American Megan Rapinoe, as strong personalities within the game, willing to take a stand off the pitch, as well as excelling on it.- Alexia's ascent -
Born in Catalonia, at 10 years old she spent a year in Barca's youth academy, but first played for Espanyol and then Levante before coming back to the team her and her family always supported in 2012, immediately establishing herself.She has won the Spanish league six times, the Copa de la Reina on seven occasions and the Champions League once, in May last year. Putellas earned the nickname 'La Reina' -- the queen.""At first I was embarrassed by it, but I understand it's all part of the business. Everyone can call me what they want,"" she said.In November 2021 Putellas became only the second Spaniard to win a Ballon d'Or, behind men's player Luis Suarez, who won it in 1960.She helped guide Barcelona to a 4-0 win over Chelsea in the Champions League final, scoring a penalty and brilliantly threading through a pass for Aitana Bonmati to net Barcelona's third.Putellas finished the 2021/22 season with 29 goals and 17 assists in the top flight and Champions League combined, a remarkable tally for a midfielder.Barcelona finished as Spanish champions, winning all 30 games, netting 159 goals in the process and only conceding 11, an unstoppable force with Putellas as the main creative influence.They have started the new campaign in the professionalised Liga F with four wins from four, watched by Putellas from the sidelines, keen to support her team-mates.From fans approaching her in the stands for autographs to being painted as a Superwoman on a mural in the elegant Gracia neighbourhood, Putellas is still present in hearts and minds in the Catalan capital. Across the world, too, represented by her second consecutive Ballon d'Or."

/business/global-economy/news/sri-lanka-slashes-fuel-prices-3145396,Sri Lanka slashes fuel prices,"Crisis-hit Sri Lanka slashed fuel prices on Monday, the second cut in as many weeks, after the World Bank warned that the economy will shrink an unprecedented 9.2 per cent this year.The energy ministry said the price of petrol will be reduced by 40 rupees to 370 rupees ($1.02) a litre from Monday night after a similar 10 per cent reduction earlier this month.But the price of regular petrol is still twice the amount before the start of the crisis last year while diesel is three and a half times more than what it was in December 2021.Earlier this year motorists spent weeks to get fuel, contributing to weeks of protests that forced President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country in July and quit.The wait at the pumps has reduced to a few hours in recent weeks, but fuel is still strictly rationed because of an enduring shortage of dollars needed to pay for essential imports.Public transport also ground to a halt due to a lack of diesel but now services are almost back to normal, although many fares -- in common with soaring prices for other services and goods -- have doubled.Official annual inflation rates are running at close to 70 per cent.The latest lowering of petrol and diesel came after the World Bank warned that the economic contraction will be worse than the 8.7 per cent forecast by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.The World Bank in its latest country update published last week said the economy will continue to shrink next year too. It expects a 4.2 per cent contraction next year.In addition to the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war, Sri Lanka's worst crisis since independence is also partly blamed on the sharp tax cuts announced by Rajapaksa after he came to power in November 2019.The crisis forced the government to default on its $51 billion foreign debt in April.Rajapaksa's successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has overturned some of the tax cuts and introduced new revenue measures.The International Monetary Fund has tentatively approved a four-year, $2.9 billion bailout.But the package is subject to an agreement with creditors including China, Sri Lanka's biggest creditor, as well as to contain inflation and tackle corruption."

Russel was one of the martyrs of the August 15 carnage when he was 10 just years old.Hasina said she and her sister Sheikh Rehana was not allowed to seek justice for the assassination of their family members until she formed the government in 1996.""Today why do we hear so many words – the words on humanity and human rights? Can anyone give the answer to my question that we could try the killers only when I had been able to form the government and become the prime minister of Bangladesh overcoming many hurdles and obstacles?"" she asked.The premier said everyone who came to power after 1975 --Ziaur Rahman, Gen Ershad and Khaleda Zia—patronised and rewarded the brutal killers.She inaugurated 5,000 Sheikh Russel Digital Labs and 300 Sheikh Russel Schools of Future (a school in each of the 300 parliamentary constituencies) as part of the government's move to equip the future generations with modern and technology-based knowledge.PM Hasina also unveiled a book titled ""Duronto Pranobanto Sheikh Russel"" featuring his childhood.A video message from Nobel Peace Laureate and renowned child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi, the trailer of an animated film ""Amader Chotto Russel Sona,'' a video documentary on Sheikh Russel and a theme song marking Sheikh Russel Day-2022 were played at the event.

/tech-startup/news/how-keep-your-social-media-safe-hackers-3145841,How to keep your social media safe from hackers,"Concerns over security on social media are growing on both personal and commercial levels. Hackers often try to take over social media accounts for unethical purposes. Regardless of the platform, there are a few steps that may be taken to secure your social media in preventing the possibility of hackers from taking over. Some of these steps are discussed below.Using MFA on your social accounts helps you add an additional layer of security to the authentication process of logging in and other sensitive processes such as changing your password, phone number or email address. This means that even if a hacker can somehow break through to know your password, they still cannot access your account. The MFA can be set up with authenticator apps such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator. They help you generate a new code every sixty seconds that only the device on which you remotely have that application set up. This is a recommended step for additional security and peace of mind. Your password is the most elementary key to accessing your account. If your password is easy to guess or is too common - the possibility of your account getting compromised is high. For instance, a password that is your name or a string of numbers or keys of a keyboard is some of the easily guessable passwords that can be cracked through a hacking attack type known as brute force, where the attacker tries on a variety of combinations of passwords repeatedly. You may use unique information or text that is not common to have a strong password. It is recommended to use a combination of texts and numbers and special symbols when possible. Also, the password should be at least 12-16 characters long. If needed, there's no loss in using passwords of 30 characters in length either. A common technique is using sentences/phrases in a password instead of a single word. Usage of both upper case and lower case alphabets are also recommended.Although this does not make your password impossible to hack, it should make it much harder to crack. To analogise, it's like putting a lock on the bicycle. A thief with enough resources will still be able to crack open the lock, but putting two or three locks will make it undesirable for the thief to steal the bike in the first place. There are various phishing links and scam third-party apps on the internet. Sometimes, they are directly given to your inbox in the disguise of an award or a gift that the hacker would claim you have ""achieved"". It could also come in other forms, such as a request for emergency help, and may take you to a phishing website, which is essentially a cheap copy of the actual sites that look like the site you are trying to browse. They might have very similar addresses and very similar landing pages as well.In these situations, please do not click on any link that does not look genuine. A general rule of thumb is never to click on any link you do not trust 100%, even if it came from a friend. Moreover, it is highly recommended that you not give your account password in any portals because the hacker could access your provided password from that link. The same applies to scam third-party apps, which may come in disguise as games or something else. Remember, your social media password would never be needed on any website other than the social media itself while logging in or changing sensitive information such as your password. They are not always secure if it is about downloading any games, software, or operating systems from unofficial sites. So, if you find yourself downloading them, only go ahead if you trust the website you are downloading from. Also, always check for community feedback on the content you are downloading/ browsing from such websites. Beyond specific recommendations you can follow to keep your account secure, a properly updated device would take a long way. If you have the latest Windows Defender or similar antivirus activated, it can help prevent you from going to scam websites and prevent phishing links from opening. You can choose to use any reputed antivirus software from the internet. Based on your need, you may choose either the free version or, for specific requirements, use the premium version. Doing this can also ensure that any sensitive information, which may or may not be stored on your social media account. However, this will ensure security for your remote device. Active antivirus software can prevent system hijacking from potential malware as well.Often, a hacker might access your account without you even realising it. To avoid such cases, you can keep your eye out for a few things. For instance, keep an eye out for the email you have set up to set notifications for your social handles. If you receive an email of a logging-in that is not you, that may also mean someone is attempting to access your account. Moreover, if you see advertisements that are unusual for a prolonged period, such as foreign products, or if you have trouble logging in to your account with prompts similar to ""too many attempts, try again"", your account may be under attack. This could also be situations such as you see you are suddenly following accounts you never followed or even your friends asking you if you sent them a link you cannot see from your end. In short, any unwarranted or unusual activity is worth inspecting to confirm your account stays secure.  "
/sports/football/news/benzema-dedicates-ballon-dor-win-the-people-3145671, Benzema dedicates Ballon d'Or win 'to the people',"Karim Benzema said he had become more ambitious with age as the Real Madrid and France striker won the Ballon d'Or on Monday, and dedicated his trophy ""to the people"".Benzema, who turns 35 in December, the day after the World Cup final, is five months older than Lionel Messi was when the Argentine won the most prestigious individual award in football for the seventh time last year.Indeed he is the oldest winner since England's Stanley Matthews won the very first Ballon d'Or in 1956.""Winning this trophy was always in the back of my mind but what has changed since I turned 30 is ambition,"" Benzema said after collecting the prize in a star-studded ceremony at the Chatelet Theatre in Paris.Benzema was just 21 when he joined Real Madrid from Lyon in 2009. He has come into his own in the Spanish capital since Cristiano Ronaldo's departure in 2018, when Benzema was 30.""Ambition really entered my head after that.""Ambition means working harder and being a leader for my team and I am lucky to play for Madrid, the best club in the world.""When I was 21, or 22, I didn't have the same ambition I have today.""Benzema was rewarded for scoring 44 goals in 46 games last season as Madrid won the Champions League and La Liga. 'Difficult moments' He also won the UEFA Nations League with France, completing a remarkable career revival for a player who was frozen out of the national team for five and a half years because of his involvement in a blackmail scandal over a sextape involving teammate Mathieu Valbuena.""I have been through difficult moments, where I wasn't playing for the national team and so was alone at Valdebebas (Real's training ground) because everyone else was away playing for their countries.""I am very happy and very proud of the work I have put in.""On stage Benzema called his prize ""the Ballon d'Or of the people"", a statement he later said was not intended to be political but ""just a nod to where I come from"".Among those to congratulate Benzema publicly was the French President Emmanuel Macron, who did so on Twitter.""Thanks to the President. That's nice,"" Benzema said.""When I play football I don't go out thinking I need to please anybody.""I just try to give emotion to people. I know today people are proud of me and that is why I said it is their Ballon d'Or.""Benzema pipped Sadio Mane to the prize, with Kevin De Bruyne completing the podium and Robert Lewandowski coming fourth.He is now targeting the World Cup with France in November and December having not been involved when Les Bleus won the trophy in Russia in 2018.""I am still ambitious. I would like to go to the World Cup with France,"" he said.""There are things that are still left to be done. I hope to be in the squad for Qatar, to go to the World Cup and do everything to win it.""

Similar to ""Poran"", Razz's other movie, ""Hawa"", has also been performing well in theatres across Bangladesh. The talented actor is currently busy promoting Raihan Rafi's football-based film, ""Damal"", which will hit theatres on October 28.The audience will once again get the chance to witness Razz's crackling chemistry alongside Bidya Sinha Mim, in this film.

Honestly speaking, I don't go anywhere without my trusty football. My whole life revolves around it now, and I am always taking pictures with it.



Which international football team do you support?
I am a huge fan of Brazil and my all-time favourite player is Ronaldinho
How did you perform the iconic 'bicycle kick' in ""Damal""?



 








I had zero knowledge about how to do a bicycle kick. Thus, when the director told me that I had to perform the bicycle kick in a scene, I had major doubts about whether I would be able to execute it to perfection. I spent 3-4 months getting into the skin of my character in the film. So, I tried my best to make sure that scene was perfect, and I am really pleased with how it was shown in the trailer. The cinematographer truly captured the scene brilliantly in the film.
In the film, it feels as if football is more important than your wife? Why did it look like your wife was angry at you?

Unfortunately, in the film, my wedding date and football match fell on the same day. Time was ticking and the Kazi was taking a lot of time. So, I had to stop him in the middle by shouting 'Alhamdulillah Kobul', before running off towards the field. When I returned after the match, my wife had locked the door and refused to let me enter. To know what happens next, the audiences will have to wait till October 28.
Tell us a little bit more about 'Damal'?

""Damal"" is inspired by the Shadhin Bangla Football Team, which was formed in 1971 during the Liberation War. In the movie, I play the captain of that team. When they go to the theatres, the audience will get to see my love for football in this film.
Both your films, ""Hawa"" and ""Poran"", are still playing in theatres. ""Damal"" will also be released soon. What are your expectations from this upcoming film?
I am really happy that both my movies ""Poran"" and ""Hawa"" are doing exceptionally well at theatres. ""Damal"" will also be released next week and thus I am hopeful that the audience will shower their love on this movie as well.

The UAE's energy minister, Suhail al-Mazrouei, wrote on Twitter: ""I would like to clarify that the latest Opec+ decision, which was unanimously approved, was a pure technical decision, with NO political intentions whatsoever.""His comment followed a statement from Iraq's state oil marketer SOMO.""There is complete consensus among OPEC+ countries that the best approach ...is a pre-emptive approach that supports market stability and provides the guidance needed for the future,"" a SOMO statement said.Kuwait Petroleum Corporation Chief Executive Nawaf Saud al-Sabah also welcomed the decision by Opec+ and said the country was keen to maintain a balanced oil markets, state news agency KUNA reported.Oman and Bahrain echoed the comment in separate statements.Algerian energy minister Mohamed Arkab, meanwhile, called the decision ""historic"" and said that he and Opec Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais expressed full confidence in it, Algeria's Ennahar TV reported.In a statement to Reuters on Monday, Arkab said the Opec+ decision, was ""a purely technical response based on purely economic considerations"".Oil inventories in major economies are lower than when Opec has cut output in the past. Some analysts have said that recent volatility in crude markets could be remedied by a cut that would help attract investors.Umer Karim, a research fellow at the University of Birmingham, said Opec countries are attempting to project unity.""The emphasis on the word 'technical' also suggests that these member states are sending a message to the US that they are not a party in this row between Riyadh and Washington,"" Karim said.US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Thursday said that ""more than one"" Opec member had felt coerced by Saudi Arabia into the vote, adding that the cut would also increase Russia's revenue and blunt the effectiveness of sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.King Salman said in an address to the kingdom's advisory Shura Council that the country was a mediator of peace and highlighted the crown prince's initiative to release prisoners of war from Russia last month.Khalid bin Salman on Sunday said he was ""astonished"" by claims his country was ""standing with Russia in its war with Ukraine"".""It is telling that these false accusations did not come from the Ukrainian government,"" he wrote on Twitter."

If we continue sending people abroad without training them, poverty alleviation will not be possible.""The noted economist spoke at a book launching ceremony at the Hotel Amari organised by the Policy Research Institute (PRI) of Bangladesh.The book -- The Odds Revisited—The Political Economy of Development o Bangladesh, authored by KAS Murshid, a former director general of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) – has been published by Cambridge University Press.Prof Mahmud said the low efficiency in the banking sector is not supportive for the country to advance to the next level.Accountability at institutions has not been ensured, so even if infrastructures have been built, the service and quality have not improved, he said.""Now, accountability needs to be ensured at institutions.""Hossain Zillur Rahman, also a former adviser to a caretaker government, echoed Prof Mahmud.""The government has built schools and hospitals but the quality of education and healthcare service remains a big challenge,"" said Rahman, also the executive chairman of the Power and Participation Research Centre.""We also need to raise competitiveness to go to the next level of development.""He added that infrastructure played a major role in the development journey of Bangladesh though the quality of services is not good enough.The book provides a detailed review of macro and sectoral developments over the past 50 years and new material and insights into the rise of Bangladesh's capitalist class, a socioeconomic perspective of the role of Dhaka-based urbanisation, and the rise of a new middle class.Prof Mahmud said there was no single factor for the development of Bangladesh's economy.""The government, the private sector, remitters and the agriculture sector all contributed to the economic success.""He described the garment sector as one of the major contributors to economic progress. ""The garment sector has flourished with the help of policy support.""He said the government has played role in mechanising the agriculture sector but it received little acknowledgement.According to Prof Mahmud, governments took stance on physical infrastructure and poverty alleviation to win acceptance among people. The economy has witnessed higher growth despite governance challenges.The development of rural infrastructures has played an important role, so the government has done a commendable job by putting emphasis on infrastructure development, said Mashiur Rahman, economic adviser to the prime minister.""Women empowerment also played a key role in the country's development and industrialisation has also made an important contribution.""Mashiur said some people always call for increasing subsidies but subsidies do not fast-track development all the time. Assessment-based development assistance can work best here.A country's development may come through individual, collective and multi-sectoral action. But collective action is still low in Bangladesh, said Hossain Zillur.""We need to find out how the collective action can be enhanced.""Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the PRI, cited the private sector, including readymade garment factories, manpower export, and agriculture, as the main pillars of the economy.""Social sector development has been a vital contributor. Development partners and non-government organisations played key roles.""The governments of the 1970s to 1980s were blamed for some of their policies. But their target to control the population and ensure food security was in the right direction, said Kazi Iqbal, a senior research fellow of the BIDS.""If the target was not set and the plan was not executed, we would have hardly got to the development stage we are now today.""Zaidi Sattar, chairman of the PRI, also spoke. "
/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/73-percent-crimes-go-unreported-3145246,73pc crimes went unreported in 2018,"Seventy-three percent victims of various crimes committed in 2018 never reported those to cops, reveals a survey commissioned by Bangladesh Police.The major reasons behind such a grim finding include difficulties in filing  cases; hassles of calling police and appearing before courts; expenses for police and legal services, and police's reluctance to cooperate.The survey, first of its kind in Bangladesh, was carried out on 1,246 respondents from 70 wards of all 12 city corporations and Bogura and Tangail municipalities.About 83 percent victims think police should be held accountable for their actions, while 85 percent said police have to be free from political bias.A team of researchers, led by Md Omar Faruk, professor of criminology and police science at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, conducted the survey titled ""Crime Victimisation Survey in Selected Urban Areas of Bangladesh"". The study results were submitted to the Police Headquarters early this month.The other reasons behind such a high percentage of unreported crimes are victims considering the crimes insignificant and not worth reporting; police's bias towards offenders and inefficiency in nabbing the lawbreakers; and people's lack of trust in the criminal justice system, the study said.Out of the total 1,246 respondents, 1,100 came up with a rough calculation about the cost of crime. The average cost of a crime was over Tk 3.35 lakh. The total cost of crimes for the 1,100 respondents was about Tk 36.93 crore.These are calculated in terms of property loss, medical cost, legal service fees, income loss, productivity loss, relocation cost, and any other cost incurred by the victims.According to the study, 55 percent victims were not satisfied at all with police support. However, 26 percent were moderately satisfied while only 16 percent satisfied.As a reason for non-satisfaction, 47 percent shared that police didn't do enough to solve the case and 13 percent thought police were not interested in solving the case at all.These figures show how the police have become detached from the people and the lack of people's trust in police, the lead investigator of the survey, Omar Faruk, told The Daily Star.He said that in the modern responsive policing system, public confidence in the law enforcers  is considered a key factor in properly measuring the cops' performance.The researcher said the survey attempts to address a gap between the yearly crime statistics prepared by the police based on their registered crime books, court orders and unreported crimes.Eighty-one percent of the respondents said police's cooperation with them would be highly appreciated, while 67 percent said police should be more humane and 91 percent opined that police need to be free from corruption to boost their image.The victims said police should ensure public security to enhance their image and they should also stop committing brutality against anyone.They also mentioned that police's accountability to its higher authorities should be ensured.Seven out of each 10 people studied agreed to the statement that the news of torture in custody causes fear among victims.The study said almost all victims agreed with the statement that the lengthy process of the criminal justice system contributes to reluctance to seek justice.Also, more than 50 percent victims think the offenders live in and around their neighbourhoods.Surprisingly, about 10 percent of the offenders were either the victims' relatives or family members.The survey revealed that Dhaka North city has the highest victimisation rates followed by Chattogram. It also stated that most of the crimes occurred between noon and 9:00pm.According to the study, the nearest police station was about 3.3 km away, on average, from the spots where the crimes were committed.Asked about the findings of the survey, Maruf Hossain Sorder, additional deputy inspector general of police (planning and research) at the Police Headquarters, said he was not aware of the study as he was new to the office.He said he would be able to comment on the report after going through it."

/star-youth/news/shikho-transforming-lives-one-student-time-3145606,"Shikho: Transforming lives, one student at a time","Tanjir Arafat Turjo, 17, hops on a bus every morning, at 6:30am from his home in Banasree, Rampura, and travels over an hour to BAF Shaheen College Kurmitola, where he's currently a first-year HSC student. Most of his youth has been crammed into commuting to and back from school, leaving no room for him to pursue his passion for programming and artificial intelligence. That changed once Turjo started using Shikho, the ed-tech app launched in 2020.""If I didn't use Shikho, I would be doing coaching after class in Kurmitola, so I would return home at around 8pm,"" said Turjo. He has 13 subjects for HSC, and uses Shikho's blend of online recorded content, mock tests and live classes to study for nine of them. With this flexibility, Turjo has been able to return home right after college ends, stay on top of his courses, while also finding the time to devote himself to the robotics lab. He is now the youngest member of Team Atlas, Bangladesh's national robotics team, competing with over thirty countries in the International Science and Invention Fair 2022.Turjo is one of 800,000 students in Bangladesh, who have started using Shikho. Whereas private coaching for nine subjects would've cost Turjo Tk 6,000 each month, he now pays Tk 12,000 whole year round for all the courses. Students who cannot afford private tuition, now find a significantly more accessible support system in Shikho. The holistic impact on students' lives is what makes Shikho standout as more than a high-tech startup, but rather as a change-making initiative in Bangladesh. Launched in 2020, Shikho's operation was run by 20 employees. Only in two years, the start-up has expanded to a team of 400 members, led by two founders who share, above all, a penchant for education. Zeeshan Zakaria, co-founder and COO, attended seven schools, both English and Bangla medium, around Bangladesh. He went on to receive training in University College London's Institute of Education, ranked as the number one institute for education globally. Zakaria pursued teaching mathematics in high schools in Bangladesh, and it is his love for teaching and his students that distinguishes him as a distinct educator. ""There is nothing more fulfilling than when a student tells me they understand a topic so much better now,"" said Zakaria.Shahir Chowdhury, co-founder and CEO, grew up in Rajar Bajar, and was raised by a high school teacher and a Dhaka University professor. He spent twelve years establishing a successful career in finance in London — as a director in HSBC, prior to which he worked in Barclays. ""But I realised I wasn't making the difference I wanted, in private banking and investment management,"" said Chowdhury. ""I found myself wanting to marry up the experience of understanding finance, technology to my childhood of growing up with educators in Bangladesh,"" he added.Before returning to Bangladesh, Chowdhury approached Zakaria, and Shikho was born out of their joint vision to make a difference in the education sector in Bangladesh. But their rise hasn't been without a hard-scrabble journey of its own.""Ed-tech was a new concept in Bangladesh; the first challenge was finding a way to show parents and students that online learning can be useful,"" said Chowdhury. ""And then there was the question of training teachers to produce content in an engaging way,"" he added.Zakaria started approaching educators and experts —  who now make their lessons  — by visiting universities such as BUET. ""I would just show up and ask to sit with them in cafeterias, and individually explain what we're trying to do at Shikho and how kids could benefit from their expertise,"" he recounted.The app is now operated through a data-centric architecture by curriculum experts devising their lesson plans. Each of their courses are designed by experts in their fields — for example, the math courses are developed by mathematicians. Instead of hiring one tutor for all subjects, which often happens to be the case in Bangladesh, students receive specialised teaching directly from their laptops and phones.Shikho transcends the mere advantages of studying at your own pace that comes with remote learning — by offering students relatable, gamified content to keep them enthusiastic about education itself.Fahim Akhter, 16, an SSC student who uses Shikho, finds it easier to understand biology topics such as the functions of a human heart with Shikho's visual aids, breaking the confines of a traditional blackboard. ""I used to really be weak in my science subjects, to the point that I was afraid of classes,"" he said, ""Now, I find myself looking forward to Shikho's videos because they show me how things work.""Shikho deploys their teachers to identify peepholes into the brains of their students; the experts know students don't watch videos over seven minutes. Strategising dexterously, the team creates lessons with the agenda of ""hooking your kids,"" said Zakaria. To explain the chapter on profit and loss to students in grade 8, Shikho made a video, interviewing egg-sellers in a real-life bazaar.""It's easier and more engaging for students when you walk them through a topic with real-life examples,"" explained Zakaria. They introduced a constellation of general knowledge videos, ""Tomra Ki Jano,"" to keep students interested in learning new concepts through animations following a story-telling format.These nitty-gritty innovations inside the learning platform complement Shikho's overarching goal of democratising education. They recently entered into a partnership with University Coaching Centre (UCC), to take the latter's university entrance exam preparation online and ensure wider access than the limited seats available in Dhaka.Previously, students from rural areas would come to Dhaka and pay to stay in lodges to receive lessons from a handful of trained teachers. With this new partnership, they can avail that same privilege without the additional hassle. The goal for this partnership, said Chowdhury, ""is that students in rural regions who couldn't normally think of Dhaka University as an option, now can dream of the same opportunities.""The start-up's expansion furthers their philosophy to help students ""win in life,"" not only in SSC, HSC, admission, but also long-term career development. For example, they identified skills gaps in Microsoft Excel and began offering training courses. And their business decisions go hand-in-hand with their mission to revolutionise the educational landscape in Bangladesh.Recently, Shikho entered into a partnership with Food Panda to offer a selection of career-development courses to riders at subsidised rates. This month, Shikho teamed up with Grameenphone, giving MyGP users access to over 70-learning videos for free.The start-up has already secured top-tier global investment from education investment specialists Learn Capital in Silicon Valley, which has backed hugely successful ed-tech companies like Coursera and Udemy. They are currently in the process of raising a Series A investment, informed Chowdhury.For the upcoming months, Shikho is focused on attracting more students to use their app and widening the scope of their impact. The team is now evermore dedicated to brand campaigning, to tackle the ongoing challenge of ""convincing parents that Shikho and online learning is worthwhile and credible,"" said Zeeshan Ahmed, head of brand marketing.In August, famed actor Chanchal Chowdhury joined Shikho's brand campaign. Though the announcement coincided with the rise of the film, Hawa, Shikho had been in talks with Chowdhury much earlier, as the actor is a former teacher himself, which makes him a trustworthy promoter for parents.With rising living costs in Bangladesh and households reportedly cutting back on expenditures like education, Shikho's current target is directed at raising awareness of the app's accessibility. They hope to ensure that kids don't have to compromise on education due to the economic crisis, and to continue on in their pursuit of nurturing the next generation of leaders."

It was the first all-female exchange,"" the Ukraine presidency's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on social media.In his daily address late on Monday, President Vlodymyr Zelensky said ""96 (of the swapped prisoners) are servicewomen, including 37 evacuees from Azovstal, and 12 are civilians.""Zelensky thanked ""all involved for this success... the more Russian prisoners we have, the sooner we will be able to free our heroes.""The head of the breakaway region of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Denis Pushilin, confirmed the exchange, saying that out of 110 people agreed in the swap, two people had decided to remain in Russia.The Russian defence ministry said that 72 people returned from Ukraine were crew of civilian ships held by Ukraine since February.It said all those returned would be flown to Moscow and provided with medical and psychological assistance.Yermak said on the Ukraine side that some of the people exchanged were mothers and daughters who had been held together. Thirty-seven, he said, had surrendered at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol.Images released by Yermak showed dozens of women -- some wearing coats and military fatigues -- disembarking from white buses.Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov in southeastern Ukraine, withstood weeks of relentless Russian bombardment, with resistance concentrated in a dense network of underground tunnels at its Azovstal steel plant."

/opinion/politics-climate-change/news/new-coalition-address-loss-and-damage-emerges-3146041,A new coalition to address loss and damage emerges,"During the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland last year, developing countries put forward a proposal to create a Finance Facility for Loss and Damage (FFLD), which was not accepted by developed countries. Instead, they replaced it by setting up the Glasgow Dialogue on Finance for Loss and Damage, which would carry on for three years before it would have any outcome.Needless to say, this was a great disappointment for all the developing countries attending COP26.However, one important development that did happen in Glasgow outside the main COP event was the setting up of a new loss and damage fund by the First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, who challenged others to match her contribution. Since then, the government of the province of Wallonia in Belgium has promised funds, as have several philanthropic foundations. More recently, Denmark was the first party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to have allocated funds specifically for addressing loss and damage caused by climate change.At the same time, the finance ministers of the member-states of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), who are known as the V20, also created a loss and damage funding window in their own multi-donor fund.Earlier this month, the Government of Scotland invited representatives from all the governments and organisations who have stepped up to address loss and damage on the ground for a two-day conference in Edinburgh, together with the high-level champions of the UNFCCC whose role is to engage with non-state actors on the platform's behalf.I was invited to speak with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the opening session of the conference, where she reiterated her three principles for funding loss and damage: first, the funds must be new and additional; second, the funds should be provided as grants and not as loans; and third, they must be explicitly allocated to address loss and damage from human-induced climate change.At the end of the conference, a new coalition of actors, both governments and organisations, is emerging. These actors are addressing losses and damages from human-induced climate change now.The challenge will now be felt at COP27, due to be held in Egypt next month. Ahead of the conference, Pakistan, on behalf of all the developing countries, has tabled the agenda of finance for loss and damage once again, and it needs to be approved at the beginning of COP27. If any country opposes this agenda item and thus causes it to not be adopted, then it will signal a failure of COP27 before it even starts officially.However, assuming that the agenda item is not blocked, the negotiations can proceed with a view to having a decision at the end of COP27 to establish an FFLD by COP28, to be held in Abu Dhabi next year. Such a result will indicate genuine progress at COP27.At the same time, as last year's conference was held in Edinburgh, there was another important meeting of the V20 and G7 finance ministers in Washington, DC on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, where the two groups of finance ministers also agreed to address loss and damage from climate change. The details of how this will be achieved in practice still remain to be explained, but it is indeed a good development.The upcoming COP27 may be the 27th climate conference, but it will be the first such event in the new era of loss and damage from human-induced climate change. This summit of global leaders must rise to the occasion and genuinely address the reality of losses and damages happening because of human-induced climate change all around the world. Dr Saleemul Huq is director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) at the Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB).

/news/bangladesh/politics/news/zilla-parishad-polls-al-suffer-losses-11-districts-3145266,Zilla parishad  polls: AL-backed candidates take 48,"The ruling Awami League backed chairman candidates lost in the zilla parishad polls in 11 districts yesterday.They failed to win despite the fact that majority of the electorates, elected representatives of local government bodies, are from the ruling party.The Election Commission yesterday announced the unofficial results of 59 zilla parishad polls. The results include 34 posts of chairman. The rest of the 25 chairmen, all backed by the AL, were elected unopposed.All members and reserved members of Bhola and Feni zilla parishads were also elected uncontested.The AL-backed chairman candidates suffered defeats at the hands of their party rebels in nine districts -- Narsingdi, Sunamganj, Faridpur, Cox's Bazar, Jhenidah, Sherpur, Patuakhali, Chandpur, and Rangpur, report our district correspondents.In Dinajpur and Panchagarh, the ruling party favourites lost to a candidate backed by the Jatiya Party and an independent.About 60,866 elected representatives of local government bodies -- upazila parishad, union parishad, municipality and city corporation -- are the electorates in the zilla parishad polls.A voter voted for a chairman, one member from each upazila and women members equivalent to one-third of the number of total members, including the chairman.In total, AL favourites won chairman polls to 48 zilla parishads out of 59.Meanwhile, Chief Election Commission Kazi Habibul Awal said they were satisfied with the election environment as ""no irregularities and violence were reported"".""We didn't see anything [through CCTV cameras] also…. We are satisfied,"" he told reporters after monitoring voting from the CCTV monitoring cell at the Nirbachan Bhaban in the capital's Agargaon.He said it was their responsibility to ensure the environment so that voters could cast their votes.The CEC said they halted the Gaibandha-5 by-polls on Wednesday after seeing irregularities while monitoring the elections via CCTV cameras.""We believe this had a positive impact on the [zilla parishad] elections.""BARISHAL INCIDENTBarishal City Corporation Mayor Serniabat Sadiq Abdullah was involved in an incident with Barishal Sadar Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Moniruzzaman at a polling centre yesterday.A video shared by the mayor on Facebook showed that he with a group of public representatives tried to enter Barishal Zilla School polling centre and the UNO, who was carrying out duties as an executive magistrate, prevented him.""Have I entered the polling centre yet? Why are you creating a scene? Am I a child who doesn't know the rules? Why are you talking like a stupid person?"" the mayor asked Moniruzzaman.Shocked at this, the UNO told the mayor that he didn't say anything to him.Speaking to journalists later, the UNO said, ""You have seen the video. The presiding officer of the polling station will be a better person to talk about the incident.""Presiding Officer Masum Billah said there was ""a little misunderstanding"" and he brought the situation under control.On August 18 last year, Mayor Sadiq got into a heated argument with then Barishal Sadar UNO Munibur Rahman over removing banners. Gunshots were fired during the incident, and three cases were filed with the local police station over the matter.NATORE MP ENTERS POLLING CENTREShafiqul Islam Shimul, lawmaker from Natore-2 (Sadar, Naldanga), reportedly entered Dighapatia MK College polling centre during yesterday's elections, violating the electoral code of conduct.He entered the centre around 11:15am and stayed there for a while.""I visited the centre as a public representative. I didn't influence anything,"" Shimul told The Daily Star.Natore Deputy Commissioner Shamim Ahmed, also the returning officer, said, ""A lawmaker cannot do this in any way. We will take action after looking into the incident.""In the morning, Shimul's personal secretary Akramul Islam was also seen entering the same polling centre with a press card shortly after the voting started.Asked about this, Akramul said he is the editor of local daily Sangbad Protikar.In Moulvibazar, member candidates Ataur Rahman and Hasan Ahmed Javed bagged 80 votes each in the zilla parishad polls.Now a lottery will be held at the returning officer's office to decide the winner, said Azedur Rahman, presiding officer of Hilalpur Government Primary School polling centre.The EC in August announced the schedule for the elections to 61 district councils.

/business/economy/news/gig-workers-deprived-fair-pay-benefits-3145361,"Gig workers deprived of fair pay, benefits","The majority of workers in Bangladesh's gig economy do not receive fair pay, benefits or even a contract from online platforms, revealing the awful situation in ensuring the rights of those workers, according to a recent study. The paper, titled ""Fairwork Bangladesh Ratings 2022: Labour Standards in the Platform Economy"", also found that players in the gig economy have poor working conditions amidst the absence of proper representation.The report was launched by Fairwork Bangladesh, a collaboration between the Dhaka-based DataSense and the Oxford Internet Institute of the University of Oxford in England, at Brac Centre Inn in Dhaka yesterday.The study interviewed 91 workers from 9 platforms: Uber, Foodpanda, Pathao, Sheba.xyz, HungryNaki, Obhai, HelloTask, Truck Lagbe, and Chaldal.Fairwork evaluates the working conditions of digital platforms and ranks them on how well they do.It uses five principles -- fair pay, fair conditions, fair contracts, fair management and fair representation -- that digital platforms should adopt in order to offer fair work.Each of the five Fairwork principles is broken down into two points and every platform receives a score out of 10. Platforms are only given a point when they can satisfactorily demonstrate their implementation of the principles.Although the overall performance and scores of local online platforms are better than that of last year, none of them were able to secure even 5 out of 10.Chaldal, HelloTask and Sheba.xyz each scored three out of 10 while Uber got two points and Foodpanda and Pathao got one each. Meanwhile, Obhai, HungryNaki and Truck Lagbe failed to score at all.As Bangladesh has no national minimum or living wage policies, platforms have no legal obligation to ensure a wage floor. However, some workers of certain platforms were found to be making higher wages than the minimum or even living wage equivalent, the study found.It also found that workers are active during a lot of their non-earning hours but are not compensated for their time. Non-earning hours refer to time spent waiting for work, travelling in traffic, and delays due to customers.Besides, no platform could share evidence that they provide a safety net for workers that would cover a loss of income and while many of them reported initiatives for an insurance programme, the worker interviews did not provide sufficient evidence that these were effective.Many workers also reported there are no paid sick leave policies in practice by their platform.Platforms continue to classify the workers as independent contractors and do not extend the benefits of full employees to gig workers. In addition, no platform shared any contract details, so it could not be evaluated for fairness, the report said.As per the report, gig workers often face decisions from platforms that affect their work and lack the means to contest these decisions. Also, worker termination is sometimes done through an automated system without human consultation.Platforms have human-centric call centers that are meant to provide support to the workers but the efficacy and reliability of these were challenged by many of the interviewees.The Dhaka Ride-Sharing Driver's Union (DRDU) is the most prominent platform workers' collective, not just for the ridesharing sector, but the entire domestic gig economy. However, only two of 30 rideshare workers interviewed were members of the DRDU.The report found a new phenomenon this year: rideshare workers are taking trips on ""khaep"", meaning that riders are offering trips to customers without using the app as a medium.Workers go on ""khaep' by finding customers directly on the streets or using the platform to connect with them. They then cancel the trip before taking them to their preferred destination for a given sum.""Safety measures, insurance policies and wage structures should be introduced for gig economy workers,"" said Razekuzzaman Ratan, member of the National Coordination Committee for Workers' Education.Belal Ahmed, general secretary of the DRDU, said he has been working for ridesharing platforms as a rider for just five years but he physically felt it was 15 years.""We have no identity, no future. I can hardly earn Tk 12,000 per month but my family expense is Tk 25,000,"" he added.Inam Ahmed, editor of The Business Standard, and Ananya Raihan, chief imaginator at DataSense, also spoke at the event. "

I am still in South Korea, at the after-party of the event. It has been exhilarating, to say the least. In 2019, I was a participant in the same event, and now I took the judge's seat – it is truly and honour. It is also very heartening to see the Bangladeshi contingent perform well here.
Who, among the Bangladeshi participants, did well?



Mir Maryam Ahmed reached the Top 10 of the 'Face of Asia' segment. Besides her, Hasnat Jami was also noticeable in the event.
Where is does the modeling industry in Bangladesh stand right now?
Despite our greatest efforts, there is a lot left to be desired in terms of events. For example, we used to have the Bangladesh Fashion week, which does not take place any more. Whatever achievements that we have in this field, it is the result of earnest efforts from a very limited number of people in this sector.



 








On that note, I would really like to thank Azra Mahmood for her constant mentorship and support for this programme.
You have achieved a lot at this young age. Do you feel like you could mentor some up-and-coming models in the future?
I cannot even think about mentoring someone, as so many seniors whom I idolize are still in their prime. I just mentioned Azra Mahmood, and there are many other talented individuals, who deserve the title of a 'mentor'. I am just happy to be able to represent Bangladesh.

I am just happy to be able to represent Bangladesh.We saw at a recent event by The Daily Star, that you are great at dance as well.(Laughs) When Blender's Choice-The Daily Star OTT and Digital Content Awards asked me to perform here, I was already learning Bharatnatyam for three months! I am glad that I was able to pull it off with limited experience, and after seeing that, Chorki also hit me up for a performance for their one-year anniversary programme.You really came into your own as an actor in ""Pett Kata Shaw"". Do you want to sign up for more acting gigs now?
I might, but I want to state clearly that my identity will always be as a model. I have lived and breathed this industry for a long time. If I had to pick an alternate career, it would be to act, but I will never forget my roots.

/opinion/views/news/faculty-recruitment-universities-are-we-doing-it-right-3145376,Faculty recruitment at universities: Are we doing it right?,"The current state of faculty recruitment at universities in Bangladesh is far from ideal, with the recruitment process mired in allegations of corruption. In order to reap the benefits of our outstanding economic growth, we must improve the quality of education by improving the standards of our teaching staff and researchers. If the education providers are well-prepared, they will prepare our future generations better.The University Grants Commission (UGC) has guidelines for the recruitment of faculty members – from lecturers to professors – at both public and private universities. While there is a common policy for private universities to recruit faculty members, public universities usually follow their own regulations and systems. There has been a debate over a unified faculty recruitment policy for all public universities in Bangladesh, and the policy is supposed to include not only the recruitment of teaching and research staff, but also the promotion and dismissal of the staff.The existing guideline for recruitment at private universities is not concrete either – it does not cover each and every aspect of recruitment and leaves a lot of room for interpretation. While it does cover a wide array of good recommendations, there is a big scope for improvement.In order to improve, we need to adopt the best international practices and adapt them to fit the Bangladeshi context. Only a handful of universities have a recruitment policy that is comparable to top global institutions. This is also evident as only a handful of institutions in Bangladesh have global accreditation. Receiving these accreditations requires a university to meet global recruitment standards as well – at least to some extent.If you look at top-ranking universities in the UK, Australia, US and China, you will see a distinct difference in the calibre, profiles, research output, and degrees of the academics. At North South University (NSU) in Bangladesh, for example, as per global practice, it is mandatory for a faculty member to have a PhD from a globally reputed institution to become an assistant professor; even a lecturer must possess a degree from an institution that is internationally ranked.While this may not be feasible for all institutions in Bangladesh, we can make some changes at least. For lecturer recruitment, we can make research experience a priority, along with experience as a teaching assistant or a research assistant, and publications and conference proceedings may also be considered. If an institution intends to accommodate only PhD recipients for assistant professorship, it can introduce positions such as associate lecturer and senior lecturer before promoting them to assistant professor based on research and teaching experience.Recruitment requirements should not be identical across the country. A university that is recently established and another that has been around for five decades will never have similar resources, recognition, and facilities to attract and retain the same level of staff. Thus, policies should be competitive and flexible.Another major concern which is an unwritten rule in Bangladesh is the fact that you will only be recruited by certain public universities if you have been a student and graduated from the same. This discourages a diverse and inclusive recruitment standard, which in 2022 is a shame. There should be a clear policy of cross-university recruitment or assignment that will help qualified faculty members to easily move across organisations and share their expertise.If we look at the most recent developments regarding university ranking by Times Higher Education, NSU, being considerably younger than its many counterparts in this region, has achieved an impeccable feat. A strong faculty pool enables NSU, like many others, to achieve impactful research output that ultimately benefited the university to perform better in the ranking.A more capable and better equipped teaching staff is a precursor to helping university students perform better and realise their own potential. We need to raise the bar of our recruitment standards so that we can develop our human capital to serve the nation in the best possible ways. In today's Bangladesh, when the level of brain drain is extremely high, we must be equipped to better treat the future of this country. Our young ones must not suffer.Md Nurul Kabir, PhD, is associate professor and chair of the Department of Accounting and Finance at North South University (NSU).

This week Australia's netball team objected to wearing jerseys with a multimillion-dollar mining sponsor on them after concerns raised by an Aboriginal player.Hancock Prospecting, a mining company led by Australia's richest person Gina Rinehart, this year announced an Aus$15 million (US$9 million) sponsorship with Netball Australia, which has booked losses of $7 million over the past two years.But the sponsorship has reportedly caused turmoil inside the Australian Diamonds national team, with Aboriginal squad member Donnell Wallam raising concerns about the company's treatment of Indigenous communities.Her stance has reportedly been widely backed by other players.Lang Hancock, founder of Hancock Prospecting and Rinehart's father, suggested in 1984 dumping chemicals in water sources to sterilise Aboriginal populations that caused trouble.Netball Australia said it was aware of ""cultural sensitivities raised by a Diamonds squad member"" but said it would retain the deal with Hancock.""Netball Australia and Hancock Prospecting have been working tirelessly to acknowledge and recognise the sensitivities, to further understand the concerns of that squad member and to provide avenues for support,"" the national body said in a statement.Netball Australia chair Wendy Archer denied reports the team had boycotted uniforms with the Hancock Prospecting logo during recent games in New Zealand.Volleyball Australia, also sponsored by Hancock Prospecting, last week said the controversy was surprising -- instead praising Rinehart for her philanthropic spirit.""Mrs Rinehart's selfless commitment to women's sport deserves the accolades of our great sporting nation,"" it said.Former Wallabies captain turned senator David Pocock has voiced his objection to Santos energy's sponsorship of the national rugby team he once led.""I was always proud to represent my country. As a rugby player, that's what you dream of. It's been difficult to watch a partnership emerge with Santos,"" Pocock recently told local media.""I really think fossil-fuel sponsorship is the new cigarette sponsorship, where they are advertising a product that we now know is destroying our home planet and our futures.""st-arb/pst"

As a result, apart from the fine, the importer has to pay the customs duty of about Tk 24 crore, the order said.Zahir, the Z&Z managing director, told The Daily Star, ""We are being harassed by customs officials for no valid reason.""Our company was accused of tax evasion of Tk 24 crore and fined about Tk 56.4 crore for importing a vehicle, although we have all legal documents with BEPZA's [Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority's] permission under the duty-free facility to import the car.""We will go for further legal procedures,"" he added.According to customs documents, the 6,750cc vehicle was imported from UK-based Vertex Auto Ltd.The company submitted the documents under the 170 Customs Procedure Code to get the duty-free benefit as a listed company of the Bangladesh Export Processing Zone that set up factories in an EPZ area before 2009.The Daily Star called Mohammad Fyzur Rahman, Chattogram customs commissioner, several times but he did not answer the phone.Mohammad Fakhrul Alam, director general of CIID, told The Daily Star, ""CIID seized the car for illegally releasing the car.

/business/news/us-could-sell-oil-emergency-reserve-week-sources-3145821,US could sell oil from emergency reserve this week - sources,"The Biden administration plans to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a bid to dampen fuel prices before next month's congressional elections, three sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.President Joe Biden's announcement is expected this week as part of the response to Russia's war on Ukraine, one of the sources said.The sale would market the remaining 14 million barrels from Biden's previously announced, and largest ever, release from the reserve of 180 million barrels that started in May.The administration has also spoken with oil companies about selling an additional 26 million barrels from a congressionally mandated sale in fiscal year 2023, which began Oct. 1, a fourth source said.The Department of Energy will also release further details on eventually buying the oil back, reflecting the White House's desire to combat rising pump prices while supporting domestic drillers.Rising retail gasoline prices have helped boost inflation to the highest in decades, posing a risk to Biden and his fellow Democrats ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections, in which they are seeking to keep control of Congress.Biden said last week gasoline prices are too high and that he would have more to say about lowering costs this week. David Turk, his deputy energy secretary, also said last week the administration can tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, in coming weeks and months as necessary to stabilize oil.The administration has spoken with energy companies about buying back oil through 2025 to replenish the SPR, the sources said, after Biden in March announced the biggest sale ever, 180 million barrels, from May to October.The Energy Department still has about 14 million barrels of SPR oil left to sell from the historic release, because selling was slowed in July and August by holidays and hot weather.Additionally, the administration is mandated by a law Congress years ago to sell another 26 million barrels of SPR oil in fiscal year 2023, which started Oct. 1, a sale likely to come soon, one of the sources said.""The administration has a small window ahead of midterms to try to lower fuel prices, or at least demonstrate that they are trying,"" said a source familiar with the White House deliberations. ""The White House did not like $4 a gallon gas and it has signaled that it will take action to prevent that again.""Average U.S. gasoline prices hit about $3.89 a gallon on Monday, up about 20 cents from a month ago and 56 cents higher than last year at this time, according to the AAA motor group. Gasoline prices hit a record average above $5.00 in June.The DOE and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the sales.In May, the DOE said it would launch bids late this year for a buy-back of about one third of the 180 million barrel sale. It suggested then that deliveries would be linked to lower oil prices and lower demand, likely after fiscal year 2023, which ends Sept. 30 next year. Two sources said the buy-backs could continue through 2025.Biden officials in recent months also urged oil refiners including Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and Valero (VLO.N) to not increase exports of fuel and warned them it could take action if plants do not build inventories.The administration has not taken a potential ban of gasoline and diesel exports off the table although opponents of such a move say it could exacerbate Europe's energy crisis and raise fuel prices at home."

Hatem also said the situation has improved a lot now as the vessels can carry goods the country without issue.Md Ruhul Amin Sikder, secretary of the Bangladesh Inland Container Depots Association, said a lot of consignments were stuck at Chattogram port during the initial days of the war as shipping lines were reluctant to carry goods to Russian.However, there are no such complaints at present as shipping lines have started carrying goods to Russia through alternative channels.On the other hand, Rajiv Chowdhury, managing director of the Fatullah-based Young 4 Ever Textile, said he will not send any goods to Russia for the time being as he is observing the situation.Chowdhury is hopeful of resuming shipments to Russia in the future though as the situation is returning to normalcy."

As a result, 109 of the 470 plots available are yet to be allotted.Sources say the fact that the plots are still unused is depriving the government of revenue, people of jobs, and small-and-medium enterprises (SME) of serviced land.Besides, the lack of proper roads and security services has resulted in a lack of interest among entrepreneurs, they said.Golam Rasul, industrial estate officer of the bscic district office in Barishal, said a project was taken up in 2015 to ready plots on the 33 acres of low land. The project is set to expire this December, but the authorities do not expect it to be completed on time.""It will take another six months to complete the entire work as the construction of roads and boundary walls is underway. The work on filling lowlands with sand is over though,"" he added.Sydur Rahman Rinto, president of the Barishal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the BSCIC had previously taken several initiatives to convert the lowlands into plots but has so far been unable for various reasons.The industrial estate is located at the heart of Barishal city with business activities in the district having grown significantly in the last five decades.Rinto then said the main approach road to the industrial estate is too narrow while the estate itself lacks the required facilities to set industries.""For these reasons, the plots remain empty even after so many years since their establishment,"" he added.There are currently 127 manufacturing units operating at the Barishal Industrial estate, of which 119 are in production while eight are underperforming.Another age-old industrial estate is the one in Pabna. Established in 1962, five of the 172 plots at the Pabna Industrial estate are yet to be allotted.Rofikul Islam, deputy general manager of the BSCIC district office in Pabna, said work is underway to allocate these plots soon as a list of applications has been sent to the head office.These plots were once allotted but the BSCIC ultimately withdrew the allotments due to non-compliance issues among the related entrepreneurs.Apart from this, industrial estates in Rajbari, Sylhet and Cox's Bazar that were built in the 1960s still have some vacant plots for various reasons, including legal complications.For example, many entrepreneurs that secured allotments through political affiliation have gone abroad, leaving their plots unused for a long time and the BSCIC has been unable to reclaim them due to legal complications.However, there are no plots vacant in the Comilla, Feni, Tongi, Mymensingh and Faujdarhat industrial estates established in the 60s.ANM Mujibur Rouf, deputy general manager of the industrial estate division at the BSCIC, said the plots that remain unallocated are not serviced in most cases, unlike the central plots.Some of the plots were allotted at different times but the allotments were later cancelled as the related industry was not established as per the rules.ONLY EIGHT OF 500 VACANT PLOTS ALLOTTED
In March earlier this year, the BSCIC published newspaper advertisements seeking applications from entrepreneurs to allot 500 plots that have been lying vacant for years, even at the more recently established industrial estates.
According to the BSCIC, the industrial estate in Gopalganj has the highest number of vacant plots with 131 while the one in Moulvibazar closely follows with 119.
Meanwhile, some 50 plots at the industrial estate in Chuadanga, 43 in Jhalakathi, 40 in Barguna, 38 in Madaripur and 33 in Khagrachari are still unused.
Rouf ‍said applications for the allotment of 165 plots have been received but only eight of them have been allocated so far.
The plots will be allotted through a ""district plot allocation committee"" with each one to be leased out for 99 years.
The BSCIC was set up in 1960 to develop industrial plots equipped with utility connections and connectivity to spur industrialisation.
Today, there are 11,922 plots in 80 industrial estates of the BSCIC across the country.
There are about 4,570 factories in production, of which 901 are export-oriented, at these estates. They employ over 62 lakh people with a total investment of Tk 63,318 crore so far, as per data from the BSCIC.

/sports/football/news/neymar-expected-testify-corruption-trial-3145691,Neymar expected to testify at corruption trial ,"Just a month before the start of the World Cup, Brazilian superstar Neymar was expected to testify in a Spanish court Tuesday at his trial over alleged irregularities in his transfer to Barcelona nearly a decade ago.Neymar had been set to testify on either October 21 or 28 but the judge agreed to bring forward his hearing to avoid a clash with his football commitments.Wearing sunglasses and a dark suit, the 30-year-old arrived at the Provincial Court of Barcelona for the start of the trial Monday with his parents who are also in the dock.Neymar spent two hours at the court before he was excused by the judge for the rest of the day's hearing after his lawyers argued he needed to rest after playing Sunday night.The player scored the only goal of the Ligue 1 match against Marseille.""Da Silva Santos Junior scored a goal when I was already in bed,"" admitted court president Jose Manuel del Amo.The high-profile trial is the culmination of a years-long legal saga over Neymar's 2013 transfer from the Brazilian club Santos to Barcelona.He then joined Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain in a world record 222 million euro transfer in 2017.Spanish prosecutors are seeking a two-year prison term for Neymar and the payment of a 10-million-euro ($9.7 million) fine.He is one of nine defendants on trial on corruption-related charges, among them his parents and their N&N company, which manages his affairs.-'Complicity to defraud' -
Investigators began probing the transfer after a 2015 complaint filed by DIS, a Brazilian company that owned 40 percent of the player's sporting rights when he was at Santos.Barcelona said the transfer cost 57.1 million euros, but prosecutors believe it was at least 83 million euros.The club said it paid 40 million euros to N&N and 17.1 million to Santos, of which 6.8 million was given to DIS.But DIS alleges that Neymar, Barcelona and the Brazilian club colluded to mask the true cost of the deal.Among the other defendants are two former Barca presidents, Sandro Rosell and Josep Maria Bartomeu, and ex-Santos boss Odilio Rodrigues Filho.Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is also set to take the stand on Tuesday by videoconference to give his opinion of how a 2011 secret pre-contract deal between Barca and Neymar influenced the market.""Neymar Junior, with the complicity of his parents and FC Barcelona and its directors at the time, and Santos FC at a later stage, defrauded DIS of its legitimate financial interests,"" said DIS lawyer Paulo Nasser on Thursday.DIS is seeking to recover 35 million euros.Neymar's lawyers insist their client is innocent, saying the 40 million euros was a ""legal signing bonus which is normal in the football transfer market"".They have said Spanish authorities lack jurisdiction to hear the case since the transfer involved Brazilian nationals in Brazil.The trial is due to end on October 31.Neymar's abrupt departure for PSG five years ago sparked a string of legal disputes, with Barcelona withholding its contract extension bonus and suing the player for breach of contract, as Neymar countersued.Both sides eventually reached an ""amicable"" out-of-court settlement in 2021.The footballer is having one of his best seasons since he joined PSG.His goal against Marseille on Sunday was his ninth league goal of the season, and he has seven assists in 11 Ligue 1 matches.But his relations with France international superstar Kylian Mbappe appear to be strained, with the 23-year-old reportedly demanding PSG sell the Brazilian.Neymar is expected to play a key role for Brazil at the World Cup in Qatar, as the South American giants seek to win the trophy for the first time since 2002, and the sixth in total.He will lead the Selecao into their Group G opener against Serbia on November 24."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/i-never-ran-after-money-and-i-never-will-tauquir-ahmed-3145971,"I never ran after money, and I never will: Tauquir Ahmed","Acclaimed director and actor Tauquir Ahmed returned to Bangladesh, after staying in the US, just two weeks back. After returning, he completed the shooting for an upcoming web-series.In a conversation with The Daily Star, Tauquir gave some insight into his recent ventures and much more. How do you perceive your deep attachment with the arts? It's a great pleasure to live and work in the arts. I never ran after money, and I never will. Art is the path I have chosen to take, I will always walk in this path.Life becomes much easier and more beautiful when are surrounded by art. However, there is another side to it.  The imperfection of art is painful, it hurts. The dissatisfaction that it creates is also agonising. Every time I create or make something new, I feel like I have to improve on it and make it better.It has only been two weeks since you returned to Bangladesh. Have you already started working?
After coming back, I worked in a web-series directed by Gautam Kairi. In the series, I got to share the screen with Zahid Hasan, Tanvin Sweety and Tanzika Amin. I have played a negative role in this project, and I think the audience will find that my character is rather complex. After a break, getting in front of the camera and acting was quite a difficult task.
Your film ""Beauty Circus"" was released recently. Have you had the chance to watch it?
I watched it right after returning to the country. In ""Beauty Circus"", I played the role of a chairman of the village and I was able to experiment with my character.



Usually I don't play this type of character. Although, it would have been better if it had been released earlier. Honestly, finishing a movie and releasing it is almost like a battle. Those who are involved in the industry know this very well.
 








How successful do you think you have been as a director?
I cannot tell you the answer to this question. The audience, critics and journalists are the ones who can give the answer. I just feel accomplished and happy when I see that the audience still watch my film ""Joyjatra"" on the month of victory.
Even now, during Eid, people watch ""Daruchini Dwip"" on television or on YouTube. At the same time, people appreciate me for my films like ""Oggatonama"" and ""Haldaa"". This fills my heart with a sense of joy. 
How did you spend your time in the US?
I spent my time by writing scripts for dramas and films. Simultaneously, I also got to spend some quality time with my children. 
What are you looking forward to in the future?
I hope to start working on my new films from next year.

/opinion/editorial/news/laudable-initiative-safe-journeys-3145621,A laudable initiative for safe journeys,"We appreciate the authorities for taking the initiative to install CCTV cameras in public buses, which has been a long-standing demand of women passengers and organisations working on women's rights. Reportedly, the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, with funding from Dipto Foundation, has initially installed cameras in 100 public buses of four companies in Dhaka. According to the government, if this helps improve the security of female passengers, the entire public transport system could be gradually brought under the initiative. While we appreciate the move, we think this is just one of the many measures that need to be taken to stop harassment of women on public transport.Installing CCTV cameras in buses will not only help in identifying culprits harassing women, but will also give women passengers the courage to protest such incidents and go to the police for help.  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Installing CCTV cameras in buses will not only help in identifying culprits harassing women, but will also give women passengers the courage to protest such incidents and go to the police for help. Unfortunately, while women have long endured all forms of sexual harassment and violence on public buses, including rape and even gang-rape, little has been done to address the issue. The only initiative that the government took, apart from reserving nine seats for women, is to introduce a small number of women-only buses in Dhaka, which are too few compared to the number of women and girls who use buses to commute every day.Over the last few years, several studies and surveys have been conducted to understand the gravity of the issue. The situation seems to have become progressively worse. The most recent survey report on this, published in late August, found that 87 percent of the women surveyed faced some form of harassment at least once in their lives, while 36 percent faced sexual harassment regularly in buses, launches, trains and at terminals. What is particularly worrying is the revelation that only 36 percent among those harassed protested after being harassed, while only one percent went to the law enforcers for support.Under such circumstances, we think installing CCTV cameras in buses will not only help in identifying culprits harassing women, but will also give women passengers the courage to protest such incidents and go to the police for help, since it will now be easier to provide evidence of the harassment. However, in addition to installing CCTV cameras and establishing a reliable monitoring system to track such crimes, there needs to be vehicle tracking systems in all public transports as well, as advised by experts.Furthermore, often women are harassed not only by other male passengers but by the bus drivers and helpers themselves. Research has found that 83 percent of women received abusive and misogynistic comments from transport staff, which makes the problem harder to address. To address this, the authorities need to undertake special programmes to educate bus drivers and helpers on gender issues. Campaigns on women's rights and safety must be carried out continuously if we really want to bring a change. Overall, the formation of a gender-responsive guideline for our entire transport sector is a must to effectively address the issue."

/business/economy/stock/news/stocks-bleed-uncertainty-deepens-3145401,Stocks bleed as uncertainty deepens,"Stocks in Bangladesh dropped for the third consecutive day yesterday as investors were largely inactive amid deepening uncertainty caused by the sharp deterioration in a number of macroeconomic indicators. Shares on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and the Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) have been under strain since the beginning of the Russian war in Ukraine in February as the global energy crisis sent inflation higher at home and abroad, intensified the economic crisis, and threaten to hurt the incomes of listed firms. But in recent weeks, uncertainty has deepened as the war escalated, the fear of a global recession has grown, a potential global food crisis looms large, and electricity shortages in Bangladesh have worsened, battering the confidence of investors.Yesterday, the DSEX, the benchmark index of the DSE, plummeted 65 points, or 1.01 per cent, to close at 6,413 points.The DS30, the index that consists of blue-chip companies, was down 0.93 per cent to 2,277, while the DSES, the Shariah-complaint index, gave up 0.80 per cent at 1,406.On the DSE, only 26 stocks advanced while 153 retreated and 182 did not see any movement.Investors panicked as the fear of a famine in 2023 is growing after the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation warned of an acute food crisis globally, said a stockbroker.Investors are also concerned about the domestic economy as major indicators posted poor performance amid the raging war.For example, export earnings slipped 6.25 per cent year-on-year to $3.9 billion in September, the first fall in 14 months, while remittances declined 11 per cent to $1.54 billion in September, the lowest in seven months.The revenue collection growth decelerated to 12.63 per cent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. In another ominous sign, inflation surged 9.5 per cent in August and 9.1 per cent in September.""So, investors are selling shares. The number of buyers is low as they worry that the situation will worsen further,"" said the stockbroker.Turnover on the Dhaka bourse fell 3 per cent to Tk 1,297 crore.All the major sectors dropped.

/news/bangladesh/news/stop-war-stop-politics-over-food-3145256,"Stop war, stop politics over food: Hasina","Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday once again called for stopping the Russia-Ukraine war, blaming the conflict for disrupting the global food supplies leading to increased cost of food.She made the appeal in a keynote speech at the five-day World Food Forum-2022 at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Rome, Italy, reports UNB.The theme of this year's WFF (October 17-21) is ""Healthy Diets, Healthy Planet"".Speaking virtually from the Gono Bhaban, Hasina said over 800 million people or 10 percent of the world's population are estimated to go to bed hungry regularly.""Things have now become worse with the Ukraine war, and subsequent sanctions and counter-sanctions, which have disrupted global food supplies and raised the cost of food,"" she said.Hasina said she had repeatedly appealed to the international community to stop war, stop politics with food, and stop wastage of food.""If, on the other hand, a fraction of the money invested on manufacturing weapons was spent on food production and distribution, no one would go hungry in this world.""Instead, please ensure food supply to areas of food shortage, and famine. As human beings, we must believe that everyone has a right to survive with food and have a decent life.""She stated that ""In real sense, there is no dearth of food in our planet. The scarcity is simply manmade"".In another event, Hasina yesterday reiterated her call to work together to produce more food and save Bangladesh from a possible global famine or food crisis against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war, adds BSS.""I again request you all not to waste food and increase food production. Bring every inch of land under cultivation. Protect Bangladesh from the possible global famine and food deficit-like situations. I believe it is definitely possible with efforts from all,"" she said.The PM was addressing a function marking the World Food Day-2022 at the Osmani Memorial Auditorium in the capital.Virtually joining the event, organised by the agriculture ministry, from the Gono Bhaban, Hasina said international organisations have forecasted that the world is going to face famine and food crisis in the days to come.""We all have to be alert from now on ... . The government and private organisations have a lot of land. Cultivate food grains whatever you can utilising every inch of abandoned land.""The premier said if all give attention to producing food, Bangladesh would not face any food crisis even if the world is hit by the famine hard.In that case, Hasina said Bangladesh would be able to extend its helping hands to the possible famine-hit countries by giving food assistance.Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder, Fisheries and Livestock Minister SM Rezaul Karim and Chairman of Parliamentary Standing Committee on the agriculture ministry and its former minister Matia Chowdhury addressed the programme.Agriculture Secretary Md Sayedul Islam gave the address of welcome.A documentary on the World Food Day and the government's efforts for development of the agriculture sector was screened at the function.The World Food Day-2022 was observed on Sunday in the country and elsewhere in the world.Hasina also stressed the need for properly preserving the produced food, particularly the perishable agri-products, and establishing food processing industries in the 100 special economic zones being set up across the country.She said Bangladesh is now concentrating on becoming self-reliant in producing edible oil.The Awami League government has brought 80,000 hectares of abandoned land under the cultivation process, she said.Hasina said her government has taken various measures, including enacting laws, establishing food testing laboratories, observing national safe food day, introducing instant screening system and engaging mobile courts to ensure safe food for the countrymen."

/sports/news/tigers-look-stay-united-through-bad-times-3145646,Tigers look to stay united through ‘bad times’,"Just a day prior, batting coach Jamie Siddons had been speaking about tail-enders getting some time in nets sessions since the top-order had productive outings in the tri-nation series in New Zealand.However, after moving to Australia, it has become necessary that their tail wag a bit more, if only for the sake of preserving dignity, especially after Bangladesh slumped to a 62-run loss to Afghanistan in their first warm-up fixture ahead of the World Cup at Brisbane's Allan Border field yesterday. Mosaddek Hossain said after the game that a win would greatly help with team bonding and better performances.The bowlers managed to restrict Afghanistan to 160 but death overs were once again a worry, with Bangladesh conceding 42 runs in the last three overs. That undid a lot of good work as Taskin Ahmed bagged two inside 14 overs and Hasan Mahmud bagged both Ibrahim Zadran (46 off 39) and Najibullah Zadran (5) to restrict Afghanistan to 118 for five after the 17th over.Liton Das -- who did not play as precautionary measure after he suffered a strain against Pakistan in the final match of the tri-series against Pakistan last week -- batted in the nets yesterday ahead of a warm-up fixture against South Africa on Wednesday.But the Tigers' response with the bat was disastrous as Fazalhaq Farooqi bagged three early wickets.Asked to open alongside Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Najmul Hossain Shanto's stumps were rattled by Farooqi after he made 12 runs before Soumya Sarkar, coming in at number three, fell to Mujeeb Ur Rahman for 1.Skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Afif Hossain also failed to keep Farooqi at bay, the swing getting the better of them as they fell for 1 and naught respectively.Stuttering at 47 for seven inside 11 overs, Mosaddek Hossain's 29 off 33 deliveries and Mustafizur Rahman's 10 off 17 balls saw Bangladesh reach 98 for nine in 20 overs, far below the 170 or 180 that Siddons said they would have to target as a batting to win a game.Mosaddek said that there were no real positives from the game, which was disappointing considering the improvement they had shown despite failing to win a single game in the recently-concluded series in New Zealand.""Many things can be said. We could not win in the last series and now we have lost the first warm-up match. When you lose, many problems find their way into the open. If we talk about positives, there was nothing from this game. But there were positives in the last series and we are improving as a team,"" he said.The all-rounder said that 'failure to execute' was once again the reason they failed and, when asked about whether they were lacking inspiration, he admitted they were going through a bad phase.""We could restrict a team to 160 but we should have chased it down. As I said, we haven't been doing well as a team. At this time, players and support staff have to stay together as a unit alongside those affiliated with the team. Since we are going through a very bad time, I feel if can rally together, then once we start winning, we will do really well,"" Mosaddek said.He was hopeful of turning things around.""We are not falling behind mentally. We need a moment of victory and if that happens, I believe the whole dynamic will change. I think everyone should believe that,"" Mosaddek concluded as the Tigers hoped such bad performances were only for warm-up games, not the Super 12 stage of the World Cup."

Even though Ayub Bachchu had a legendary career with both LRB and as a solo artiste, he continued his never-ending journey towards making even more memorable classics.In June of 2018, The Daily Star sat down with the legendary Ayub Bachchu for what would be one of his last full-length interviews.It seems like you have added a new guitar to your already majestic collection. Tell us about it.I was just practicing with this one; it is a 'Rusty Cooley' signature guitar from Dean. Rusty Cooley is a guitarist I have grown to admire a lot in recent years. His technique is immaculate, and he is one of the fastest shredders in the world today.  Every guitar I own is like a friend of mine, and they listen to what I want to articulate through my tunes.Do you listen to music from the newer bands in the industry?
Of course. I think the kids are doing some amazing work, and I love all of them. I will not take any particular names of musicians that I like, because that will be unfair to the others who are doing so well. They will go very far if they stay humble and passionate towards their craft.
Could you tell us about some of the new music you are working on at the moment?
I will be doing some new songs that will connect to the audience like none before them. The songs will bring back the feelings one could perhaps derive from ""Cholo Bodley Jai"" or ""Keu Shukhi Noy"". I am never the one to think that I have done enough, because I know that a musician's journey is endless. And from my side, the best is yet to come.



A lot of people have complained that the access to the internet and social media has made a negative impact on music as a whole, due to the 'viral' culture that has emerged. What are your thoughts on this?
Before putting the blame on something or someone, we have to look at what we ourselves are doing. The industry will always keep changing, we have to accept that and adapt to it. When you walked in to take this interview, you saw that I was practicing music, and getting ready for the next show. A musician should not think about what is going on around him; he should just be true to himself and keep on making music that he likes. In fact, I will request all the bands in the country to never stop believing in yourself, your day will come.

At that moment he knew it.""Klopp was sent to the stands following a heated altercation with the assistant referee during the win against City but the German expects to be in the dugout at home to West Ham United on Wednesday.""I think I will be there tomorrow because nothing happened yet. I don't think something will happen tomorrow a few hours before the game,"" he said.Klopp's outburst attracted criticism from Ref Support UK, a charity that offers support to referees in grassroots football where abuse is common. City boss Pep Guardiola's behaviour was also called into question.""I still think I should have dealt differently with the situation which I usually do,"" added Klopp.""The whole game led to that a little bit. It was a very, very intense game with a lot of decisions we didn't understand on both sides... I'm not happy with my reaction but that's the way it was and everybody saw it.""Liverpool are eighth in the league standings with 13 points from nine games, two points ahead of 12th-placed West Ham."

How do you feel about it?
Razz's success means the world to me. I can't describe how proud I am of my husband. In some ways, I am like a 'Royal Queen', who is enjoying the success of their handsome king. I cannot live without my King, and his success gives me great joy. I am truly grateful to Allah for blessing us with such good fortunes.



A few days back, you gifted yourself an 'iPhone' as an advance birthday gift. Could you tell us the reason behind this sudden surprise for yourself?
I love surprising myself and giving myself gifts. This is my life and I need to provide myself with things that bring me joy and make me feel good.
Was 2022 special for you?
 








This year has been really special for me. I got to experience motherhood for the first time, being blessed with a beautiful baby boy in the process. At the same time, Razz's films became a supershit, causing his popularity to skyrocket. What more could I have asked for this year?



Your birthday is on October 24. Why do you usually opt for a grand celebration on your birthday? 
I love celebrating birthdays, as it's something that is really close to my heart. Some people like to sleep on their birthday, while others simply forget about it. However, I feel like birthdays only come once a year and thus they should be celebrated in a grand manner. One needs to make it as memorable as they can.
So, can we expect a grand celebration for your birthday this year?








Want to spend time with my son, won’t return to acting at the moment: Pori Moni Read more
In the past, I used to cut my birthday cake with my Nanu. However, now I will get to celebrate it with three people: my Nanu, Razz, and Rajya. I will cut the cake while holding Rajya's hand and together the four of us will make it a memorable day.
What type of gift would make you happy on your birthday?
 








Honestly, I don't expect anything from anyone on my special day. I just want everyone's love and blessings, that's all. However, if they still want to give me gifts they can give me flowers and books as presents. I would really appreciate that.
Your birthday celebrations usually have a theme based around a colour. Is there any specific reason why you choose to go with a colour-based theme?
There is no particular reason. I simply choose the colour which I like and then I tell everyone to dress in that colour. This time, I will be doing something with white and there will also be a combination of watercolours.

His 2010 debut novel, Chinaman, pegged as the second-best cricket book of all time by Wisden, won the 2011 Commonwealth Book Prize, among others. The Booker Prize-winning second novel opens with a photographer, the eponymous Maali Almeida, who has woken up dead in a celestial visa office, while his body sinks in the Beira Lake in Colombo. Maali has seven moons to find the man and woman he loves and lead them to  ""a hidden cache of photos that will rock Sri Lanka"".Booker Prize judges described The Seven Moons as a ""metaphysical thriller, an afterlife noir that dissolves the boundaries not just of different genres, but of life and death, body and spirit, east and west.""""It is an entirely serious philosophical romp that takes the reader to 'the world's dark heart' — the murderous horrors of civil war Sri Lanka,"" they said. ""I've no doubt many novels will be penned about Sri Lanka's protests, petrol queues and fleeing Presidents. But even though there have been scattered incidents of violence, today's economic hardship cannot be compared to the terror of 1989 or the horror of the 1983 anti-Tamil pogroms,"" the author said upon receiving the award. ""I began thinking about it in 2009, after the end of our civil war, when there was a raging debate over how many civilians died and whose fault it was. A ghost story where the dead could offer their perspective seemed a bizarre enough idea to pursue, but I wasn't brave enough to write about the present, so I went back 20 years, to the dark days of 1989,"" he added. David Galgut, last year's winner for the novel The Promise, handed the GBP 50,000 prize money to Shehan Karunatilaka at a ceremony held in London yesterday, October 17. The Booker Prize is awarded annually to the best book published in Britain. This year's shortlist included British author Alan Garner's Treacle Walker, Zimbabwean author NoViolet Bulawayo's Glory, Small Things Like These by Irish writer Claire Keegan, American author Percival Everett's The Trees and Oh William! by American author Elizabeth Strout. "

At a meeting between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Brunei sultan on Sunday, the two countries signed a deal and three memorandums of understanding (MoUs), including one on a long-term collaboration in the energy sector, particularly in the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and other petroleum products to Bangladesh. It comes at a time when Bangladesh is searching for alternative sources of energy amid a spike in fuel prices as well as supply-chain disruptions in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.Like Bangladesh, Brunei has been also focusing on diversifying its economy, with an eye to the future. Both countries can benefit enormously for increased collaboration, although bilateral trade between the two is far below its potential at the moment.  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Like Bangladesh, Brunei has been also focusing on diversifying its economy, with an eye to the future. Both countries can benefit enormously for increased collaboration, although bilateral trade between the two is far below its potential at the moment. The sultan's visit is a reciprocal one after Sheikh Hasina's state visit to Brunei in 2019. Besides the energy agreement, the two leaders also signed MoUs on recruitment of workers from Bangladesh and recognition of certificates for the seafarers, in addition to a deal on direct flights between the two countries. Bangladesh has a major stake in the labour agreement. About 20,000 Bangladeshis are currently working in Brunei. The possibility of more recruitments is an aspect that the government will certainly like to explore, while making sure the interests of workers are protected through a fixed minimum wage, insurance and reducing recruitment costs. For this to benefit all sides, it is also essential that the recruitment process is managed in a transparent and orderly manner.Bangladesh and Brunei share strong commonalities in terms of faith, tradition and a shared vision of peace and prosperity. Brunei is said to be the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia, and also the ninth-largest producer of LNG in the world. But like Bangladesh, it has been also focusing on diversifying its economy, with an eye to the future. Both countries can benefit enormously for increased collaboration, although bilateral trade between the two is far below its potential at the moment. Some of the areas where trade and cooperation can be increased were highlighted during the delegation-level meeting on Sunday, including maritime connectivity, agriculture, livestock and fisheries, training and exchange of services in health sector, defence and security, disaster response, humanitarian operations, information technology, etc. Bangladesh also invited Brunei to invest in its special economic zones.For Bangladesh, diversifying its sources of energy including LNG is vitally important, as it relies heavily on energy imports for power generation. In that, Brunei offers a potentially stable and long-term alternative. With the global energy market going through unprecedented volatility since the Russia-Ukraine war, and Bangladesh facing a crisis with rising demands for energy but shrinking ability to procure or produce it, it is all the more important that the country has as many options as possible.With the sultan's visit, Foreign Minister Abdul Momen said that Bangladesh's bilateral relationship with Brunei has reached a ""new height"". We do hope this will result in a new, elevated level of engagement in the form of increased trade, investment and mutual cooperation."
/sports/news/city-miss-trick-arsenal-just-will-not-go-away-3145631,City miss a trick as Arsenal just will not go away,"Liverpool's recent jitters meant they were there for the taking by Manchester City on Sunday, but the unusually conservative champions missed a trick, falling further behind Premier League leaders Arsenal who must be taken seriously as title contenders.Last season, two breathless 2-2 draws between Liverpool and Manchester City showcased the best of what the Premier League had to offer - two brilliant teams at the peak of their powers - but this term, the new-found rivals have enjoyed differing form.While champions City, chasing a fifth league title in six seasons, travelled to Anfield unbeaten, having plundered 33 goals in nine league games at the start of the new campaign, Liverpool trailed in their wake.A worst start to a league season after eight games since 2012-13, when Liverpool went on to finish seventh, meant City will have fancied their chances of earning a first win over the Reds in five matches in all competitions.Confidence would have been sky high with Erling Haaland gunning for his 21st goal in a remarkable debut season so far in England, up against an injury-ravaged Liverpool backline, who had 36-year-old midfielder James Milner at full back.But, the champions could not get going at Anfield, restricted to half chances in the first half, with an unusually reserved formation from coach Pep Guardiola curbing their flow.Liverpool looked nervy in possession, giving the ball away with regularity, but a normally ruthless City could not capitalise.After they were denied an opener in the second half by VAR, they never really threatened the Liverpool goal, and there was only going to be one winner, with Mohamed Salah's fine solo effort making all the difference.It was more frustration against Juergen Klopp for Guardiola. The Spaniard has lost 11 matches against the German as a manager, at least four more defeats than against any other coach.""Many years we come here and we lost because we made a mistake and played one of the best teams in the world,"" Guardiola said.""At that level, we cannot concede the mistakes. It is October, so we must learn.""Not just in terms of points, City could have really taken a position of superiority in this new-found rivalry with victory, but instead allowed Liverpool to get the win they need to galvanise their stuttering campaign.The other big winners from City's Anfield lapse were Arsenal. Nobody tipped Mikel Arteta's side to be serious title contenders this season, not after finishing no higher than fifth in the standings in each of the last six campaigns.Their impressive early season form was put down to new signings making an instant impact, but few predicted it would last.However, another hard-fought victory against a vibrant Leeds United on Sunday, with the hosts throwing everything at the Gunners, proved Arsenal must be taken seriously as rivals to City's crown.With a four-point league lead, and having won 12 of their 13 games this season in all competitions, a first Premier League title since 2004 could be a realistic prospect."

""We are taking you to your mother,"" was the false hope given to Russel, and soon after bullets were fired, a pointer to the sheer barbarity unleashed by the group of assassins, part of a larger national and international conspiracy, with the murderers going unpunished for decades.The post also includes an animated video, portraying the fateful night of August 15, 1975, in which little Russel is seen crying in a pool of blood at the Dhanmondi 32 house.Russel would have celebrated his 59th birthday today, had the assassins' bullets not snuff out his life.The feeble voice of Russel, begging for life, was drowned out by the beastly laughter of the murderers and the rattling shots of brushfire. The voice of the little angel was silenced forever, wrote Sajeeb Wazed.A pack of traitors brutally murdered a child, along with other members of Bangabandhu's family, to avenge defeat in the Liberation War, added the post.""How can we, Bengalis, get rid of this stigma?

/business/economy/news/rising-external-debt-poses-risks-forex-reserves-3145446,Rising external debt poses risks to forex reserves,"Rising external debt may pose some risks to Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves in the future as higher debt servicing will be required on accumulated loans, said the Bangladesh Bank yesterday. The country's external debt has been rising since 2016 in tandem with notable economic growth.Outstanding external debt stood at $90.8 billion in 2021, up 28.4 per cent from a year ago.Short-term external debt surged 64.6 per cent last year while long-term external debt increased by 21.8 per cent.""Growing short-term external debt may entail higher risk due to their potentiality of being reversed in the near-term and may, thereby, create sudden pressure on foreign exchange reserves,"" said the BB's Financial Stability Report for 2021.A central banker, who worked on preparing the report, says that foreign lenders usually look into the category of foreign debts before providing new ones.If the amount of short-term foreign debts increases in an economy persistently, the trend is considered as a risk for the nation, he said.Under such a situation, foreign lenders show reluctance in giving out long-term loans, the official said.So, a growing short-term loan, which carries a tenure of up to three years in most cases, usually creates additional risk on a country's foreign exchange reserves.The central bank has sounded the alarm at a time when Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves are plummeting due to the higher import payments against lower export earnings and a sluggish trend of remittance inflow.The reserves stood at $36.3 billion on October 12 in contrast to $46.2 billion in September last year.The report, however, says that Bangladesh preserved enough reserves last year to contain any short-term debt reversal.About 39.2 per cent of reserves could cover the withdrawal of total short-term debt.The BB report shows that short-term external debt in the private sector recorded a strong increase compared to the public sector last year.The private sector took foreign loans worth $6.33 billion last year in contrast to $0.77 billion received by the public sector.Private companies took foreign loans to the tune of $25.95 billion collectively as of June this year, up 39 per cent year-on-year.The report says that the economic recovery in major trading partners coupled with easy financial conditions and retention of migrant workers by top remittance-source countries contributed to lessening the risk in the external sector last year.A substantial rise in oil prices in the face of strong global demand strengthened the oil-exporting economies, creating space for new employment there.""But oil spirals entail a different risk to inflating input cost of domestic production and the rising price of imported goods, both of which could take a toll on domestic inflation.""Inflation in Bangladesh surged to a 10-year high of 9.52 per cent in August. It, however, fell to 9.10 per cent in September, data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics showed.""The geopolitical tension and price hike may pose some threats in the near future which need to be dealt with prudence,"" the report said.The Covid-19 pandemic caused some imbalances in the domestic economy by distorting demand-supply dynamics.In addition, the external debt racked up substantially owing to the increase in private sector short-term external debt, inflation and exchange rate volatility in 2021.Eventually, the domestic economy component faced challenges and was subject to slightly greater risk.""Ensuring that inflation remained tamed and the exchange rate is stable is crucial to the gradual acceleration of the economy and reducing the risk to the domestic sector,"" the central bank said.The exchange rate movement is critical to the trade competitiveness of a country, with a falling rate conducive to rising export and an increasing rate favourable to growing imports.The real effective exchange rate index rose in 2021 largely because the nominal exchange rate of the taka was not adjusted in line with inflation differentials with partner countries.The dollar traded at Tk 107.5 in the inter-bank platform on October 10, up 25.6 per cent from a year earlier.Going ahead, the BB report said, Bangladesh may face some downside risk to narrowing surpluses given the reduction of preferential treatment or withdrawal of trade term facilities on the ground of graduation to a developing economy from a least-developed country."

I had known Masum Aziz for many years … His ability to blend into whichever character was thrown at him was truly wonderful to watch. There is no role that Masum could not play.""Salahuddin Lavlu said, ""I am heartbroken by this loss … He was a simple human being and an extraordinary artiste -- at times almost larger than life. Even though I am extremely saddened by his passing, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to get to know him.""Azizul Hakim said, ""Masum Aziz was an actor to his core.

/opinion/editorial/news/we-must-avert-food-crisis-3146016,We must avert food crisis,"In the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war and the global disruption of fuel and energy prices, there has been a lot of discussion on what happens next, and many international leaders have weighed in on the debate – some calling for conflict resolution, and many moving towards greater militarisation. In the midst of all the uncertainty, we applaud PM Sheikh Hasina for being a strong voice in representing the developing world's greatest concern: the impact of the war on global food supplies and the cost of food. And we wholeheartedly support her call to action to ensure that no country suffers from food shortage and famine, especially when such shortages are a result of conflict and not any actual scarcity of food resources.This call to action has never been more urgent in the Bangladeshi context, where food inflation reached almost 10 percent in August – the highest since the fiscal year 2012-2013 – before dropping to nine percent in September. Despite the fact that we have made gains in food production and ensured greater availability of rice in recent years, it is still being sold at near-record high prices. People are lining up from the crack of dawn to buy rice and flour from OMS trucks at subsidised prices.The situation is made even worse by the fact that the recovery from the loss of earning during the pandemic for people from low-income backgrounds has been painfully slow, meaning they are forced to spend less for food in order to pay for rent, utilities and healthcare. A recent WFP survey has found that around 68 percent of the population are struggling to buy food. In this context, we must take all possible measures to ensure the situation does not escalate into a full-blown food crisis or famine.Immediate measures must be taken to stop the wastage of food, improve food storage facilities and transportation networks, and cultivate land for food production. In this, we can all play a role, but the relevant authorities must play the leading role in implementing the PM's directives. Far too many glaring discrepancies remain in this regard. For example, while the PM has asked that every bit of cultivable land is used for food production, the latest DAP for Dhaka allows for construction on the little agricultural land left on the city outskirts based on certain conditionalities. Such gaps between policy and action must be urgently plugged if the issue of food scarcity is to be dealt with effectively."
/environment/natural-resources/energy/news/power-grid-failure-not-listening-nldc-was-the-prime-cause-3145296,Not following procedure caused grid failure: PGCB probe report ,"Three factors caused the national grid failure on October 4, found the probe body of Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. The power grid malfunction had left large swathes of Bangladesh without electricity for four to eight hours, affecting over 130 million people. The main factor behind the grid failure occurred due to power distribution companies ""not reduce lessening the load in due time,"" as per the National Load Dispatch Centre's (NLDC's) instruction, said Yeakub Elahi Chowdhury, the chief of the probe committee. The other factors were Ghorashal substation transforming power above its capacity and tripping; and the sudden increase in demand when a private steel mill started consuming electricity directly from the national grid without informing NLDC, according to probe committee members, who spoke to The Daily Star yesterday. ""The National Load Dispatch Centre told the distribution companies -- DPDC, DESCO, PDB and REB -- to shed load instantly, but they failed to do so and the grid couldn't take the load at 2:05pm [on October 4],"" a member of the probe body told The Daily Star, on the condition of anonymity.""All those things happened, but the main reason behind it was that they (power distribution companies) did not follow the NLDC's instruction,"" said Yeakub Elahi Chowdhury. All four power distribution companies — identified as not heeding to the NLDC's instruction — formed separate internal committees to identify what happened and verify PGCB's claim.Referring to the probe report, a source at the power division said the grid failure was a result of a lack of coordination between the NLDC and distribution companies.He said the Ghorashal grid substation on October 4 had the capacity to transform 900MW, but it was dealing with about 1,100MW, and tripped.After connection between the eastern and western parts of the grid was lost, the NLDC failed to get distributors to decrease load which caused the grid failure, and power plants tripped one after another, the source said.The PGCB probe body submitted the report to the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources on Sunday and suspended two of its engineers for negligence.The engineers -- Allama Hasan Bakhtiar and Md Mostafizur Rahman -- used to work for Single Programme-Multiple Data (SPMD) of Dhaka-1 section of PGCB. SPMD is a data management system for power transmission.On the same day, the state minister for power, energy and mineral resources Nasrul Hamid told reporters that action would be taken against those who were involved in the incident.Contacted, managing directors of DPDC and DESCO -- power distributors in the capital, said they always follow the instruction of the NLDC.""I never heard that such an incident of a blackout happened due to not shedding load,"" said Bikash Dewan, managing director of DPDC.Md Kausar Ameer Ali, MD of Desco, said, ""There were no such records of not following the instructions of the NLDC. The committee will check.""Another committee from the power division is investigating the incident and is yet to submit its findings."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/kanye-buys-right-wing-social-site-parler-after-being-banned-twitter-instagram-3145866,"Kanye buys right-wing social site 'Parler' after being banned from Twitter, Instagram","The rapper formerly known as Kanye West is offering to buy right-wing friendly social network Parler shortly after getting locked out of Twitter and Instagram for antisemitic posts.The acquisition of Parler would give West, legally known as Ye, control of a social media platform and a new outlet for his opinions with no gatekeeper. The question is, who will listen?Even among the new breed of largely right-wing, far-right and libertarian social apps that purport to support free speech by having looser rules and moderation, Parler's user base is tiny — and with competition only increasing for the relatively small swath of mostly older people who want to discuss politics online, there is no clear roadmap to growing it beyond a niche platform chasing crumbs left by mainstream social media.If Tesla CEO Elon Musk goes through with his planned purchase of Twitter, things may get even more complicated for Parler. That's because Musk has already made it clear he would like to loosen Twitter's rules and content-moderation efforts, including reinstating the account of former President Donald Trump. If the libertarian and far-right users who left Twitter — either because they felt it was constricting to their political views or because they were kicked off — return, sites like Parler, Gab and Trump's Truth Social could end up losing users.Parlement Technologies, which owns Parler, and West said Monday the acquisition should be completed in the fourth quarter, but the price and other details were not disclosed. Parlement Technologies said the agreement includes the use of private cloud services via Parlement's private cloud and data center infrastructure.Parler restructured its business last month to form Parlement Technologies, which it said aims to become the ""world's premier free speech technology infrastructure and platform."" This means that rather than running a single platform such as Parler, the company wants to provide services to other niche sites that are often deemed too extreme for mainstream tech companies to support. A Parlement spokesperson said the deal with West was not yet in the works when the company was restructured and the two transactions are separate.Ye was blocked from posting on Twitter and Instagram a week ago over antisemitic posts that the social networks said violated their policies. In one post on Twitter, Ye said he would soon go ""death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,"" according to internet archive records, making an apparent reference to the U.S. defense readiness condition scale known as DEFCON.Ye has also suggested slavery was a choice and called the COVID-19 vaccine the ""mark of the beast."" Earlier this month, he was criticized for wearing a ""White Lives Matter"" T-shirt to his collection at Paris Fashion Week.""In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,"" Ye said in a prepared statement.Parler has struggled amid competition from other conservative-friendly platforms like Truth Social, which are tiny as well compared with mainstream social media sites. Parler had an average of 725,000 monthly active users in the U.S. for the first half of this year, according to Data.ai, which tracks mobile app usage. That's down from 5.2 million in the first half of 2021. Overall, including people outside the US, Parler still failed to reach the 1 million mark in the first half of this year.Truth Social, meanwhile, had 2.4 million monthly users during the same period, despite launching just in February and only on Apple devices, according to Data.ai. The market research firm said another right-leaning platform, Gettr, which launched in July 2021, is ahead of both Parler and Truth Social with about 3.8 million monthly active users.None of them come close to Twitter, which reported that it had a daily average of about 237.8 million active users during its most recent quarter. Many of the right-wing platforms emerged from opposition to the content-moderation restrictions at mainstream services such as Twitter and Facebook, but they have failed to attract users in large numbers.Part of that reason may be that most people don't actually want to discuss politics online. According to the Pew Research Center, one-third of tweets sent in the U.S. are political in nature, but these are mainly sent my a small subset of mostly older people. While Americans ages 50 and older make up 24% of the US adult Twitter population, they produce nearly 80% of all political tweets, according to Pew. This is the audience Ye's Parler would have to be courting if the rapper is serious about growing Parler's user base.Parler launched in August 2018 but it didn't start picking up steam until 2020. It was kicked offline in January 2021 over its ties to the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol earlier that month. A month after the attack, Parler announced a relaunch. It returned to Google Play last month.""This deal will change the world, and change the way the world thinks about free speech,"" Parlement Technologies CEO George Farmer, who is married to conservative activist Candace Owens, said in a prepared statement."

When I was small, it was a childhood dream, I never gave up... Anything is possible,"" Benzema said on stage at the ceremony.""There was a difficult period when I wasn't in the French team but I never gave up. I'm really proud of my journey here.

/business/news/more-us-companies-charging-employees-job-training-if-they-quit-3145831,More US companies charging employees for job training if they quit,"When a Washington state beauty salon charged Simran Bal $1,900 for training after she quit, she was shocked.Not only was Bal a licensed esthetician with no need for instruction, she argued that the trainings were specific to the shop and low quality.Bal's story mirrors that of dozens of people and advocates in healthcare, trucking, retail and other industries who complained recently to US regulators that some companies charge employees who quit large sums of money for training.Nearly 10 per cent of American workers surveyed in 2020 were covered by a training repayment agreement, said the Cornell Survey Research Institute.The practice, which critics call Training Repayment Agreement Provisions, or TRAPs, is drawing scrutiny from US regulators and lawmakers.On Capitol Hill, Senator Sherrod Brown is studying legislative options with an eye toward introducing a bill next year to rein in the practice, a Senate Democratic aide said.Ellison told Reuters he would be inclined to oppose reimbursement demands for job-specific instruction while it ""could be different"" if an employer wanted reimbursement for training for a certification like a commercial driving license that is widely recognized as valuable.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has begun reviewing the practice, while the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have received complaints about it.The use of training agreements is growing even though unemployment is low, which presumably gives workers more power, said Jonathan Harris who teaches at the Loyola Law School Los Angeles.""Employers are looking for ways to keep their workers from quitting without raising wages or improving working conditions,"" said Harris.The CFPB, which announced in June it was looking into the agreements, has begun to focus on how they may prevent even skilled employees with years of schooling, like nurses, from finding new, better jobs, according to a CFPB official who was not authorized to speak on the record.""We have heard from workers and worker organizations that the products may be restricting worker mobility,"" the official said.TRAPs have been around in a small way since the late 1980s primarily in high-wage positions where workers received valuable training. But in recent years the agreements have become more widespread, said Loyola's Harris.One critic of the CFPB effort was the National Federation of Independent Business, or NFIB, which said the issue was outside the agency's authority because it was unrelated to consumer financial products and services.""(Some state governments) have authority to regulate employer-driven debt. CFPB should defer to those governments, which are closer to the people of the states than the CFPB,"" it added.NURSING AND TRUCKINGBal said she was happy when she was hired by the Oh Sweet salon near Seattle in August 2021.But she soon found that before she could provide services for clients, and earn more, she was required to attend trainings on such things as sugaring to remove unwanted hair and lash and brow maintenance.But, she said, the salon owner was slow to schedule the trainings, which would sometimes be postponed or cancelled. They were also not informative; Bal described them as ""introductory level."" While waiting to complete the training, Bal worked at the front desk, which paid less.When she quit in October 2021, Bal received a bill for $1,900 for the instruction she did receive. ""She was charging me for training for services that I was already licensed in,"" said Bal.Karina Villalta, who runs Oh Sweet LLC, filed a lawsuit in small claims court to recover the money. Court records provided by Bal show the case was dismissed in September by a judge who ruled that Bal did not complete the promised training and owed nothing. Villalta declined requests for comment.In comments to the CFPB, National Nurses United said they did a survey that found that the agreements are ""increasingly ubiquitous in the health care sector,"" with new nurses often affected.The survey found that 589 of the 1,698 nurses surveyed were required to take training programs and 326 of them were required to pay employers if they left before a certain time.Many nurses said they were not told about the training repayment requirement before beginning work, and that classroom instruction often repeated what they learned in school.The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said in comments that training repayment demands were ""particularly egregious"" in commercial trucking. They said firms like CRST and C.R. England train people for a commercial drivers license but charge more than $6,000 if they leave the company before a certain time. Neither company responded to a request for comment.The American Trucking Associations argues that the license is portable from one employer to another and required by the government. It urged the CFPB to not characterize it as employer-driven debt.Steve Viscelli, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who spent six months training and then driving truck, said the issue deserved scrutiny.""Anytime we have training contracts for low-skilled workers, we should be asking why,"" he said. ""If you have a good job, you don't need a training contract. People are going to want to stay."""

/sports/cricket/news/binny-replaces-ganguly-bcci-president-3145891,Binny replaces Ganguly as BCCI president,"World Cup winner Roger Binny was Tuesday appointed head of India's cricket board -- the sport's richest body -- replacing Sourav Ganguly after he was reportedly forced out in a political tussle.Binny, 67, was elected president at a meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in Mumbai, where secretary Jay Shah won another term in office, vice-president Rajeev Shukla told reporters.The BCCI, which has a net worth reported at $2 billion, enjoys significant clout internationally in cricket but has been in chaos and there have been a slew of court cases involving the powerful organisation.Bangalore-born Binny, who was part of India's historic 1983 World Cup-winning squad, steps into the shoes of Ganguly, widely regarded as one of cricket's greatest captains.Ganguly, 50, had initially been tipped to earn a second term as president but reports said he was shunted out because he refused to join India's ruling party.Ganguly's political allegiance has been a regular source of media speculation, especially after the country's Home Minister Amit Shah, father of BCCI secretary Jay, visited him at home earlier this year.Politicians from Ganguly's home state of West Bengal, where the former player enjoys near-godlike status, alleged that the former batsman was forced out.'Political vendetta' 
India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been pushing hard to win power in the eastern state, falling short in elections marred by deadly violence last year.Ganguly's departure was a ""political vendetta"" by the government, opposition lawmaker Santanu Sen said on Twitter.Shah's Hindu nationalist BJP has denied any involvement in Ganguly's removal and accused their opponents of politicising the issue.Ganguly has not spoken publicly on his departure but reports said he had been hoping to continue, especially after India's top court recently relaxed a rule that barred sporting officials from consecutive terms in office in the same position.Commentators said Binny was well suited for the high-profile role, having burnished his credentials on and off the field.""He has got the cricketing stature and he is no stranger to cricket administration,"" said sports journalist R. Kaushik.""He has what it takes when it comes to administration and obviously what he has achieved as a cricketer, we know what he has done on the field,"" he told AFP.Born in an Anglo-Indian family, Binny as a batsman could either open the innings or bat in the middle order. In 27 Tests, he scored 830 runs while accumulating another 629 runs from 72 ODIs.But it was his medium-pace bowling and his ability to swing the ball both ways that made him a useful player to have in the squad. He picked 47 wickets in Test cricket and 77 in ODIs.After hanging up his boots in 1987, Binny dabbled in coaching and sports administration.He coached the junior team that won the Under-19 World Cup in 2000 and after a stint at the Karnataka State Cricket Association became a national selector in 2012."

/sports/cricket/news/cummins-named-australia-odi-captain-3145666,Cummins named Australia ODI captain,"Test skipper Pat Cummins will also captain Australia in one-day internationals after being named as the replacement for Aaron Finch by Cricket Australia on Tuesday.The 29-year-old becomes Australia's 27th one-day captain and the first fast bowler to hold the position after impressing in his first year as test captain.The timing was surprising given Cricket Australia last week set in motion a process that could see David Warner's life ban from leadership positions revoked and allow the batsman to be considered for the post.Head selector George Bailey, however, said the announcement needed to be made without delay given the proximity of next year's World Cup in India, adding that it had in any case been all but a formality.""Internally, it's a no-brainer decision, Pat is the person we want leading the team,"" Bailey told a news conference in Brisbane.""The campaign focus is very much on the 2023 World Cup, I think we've got 14 games before that and we think Pat's the perfect person to lead this group to that tournament. ""Finch, who will lead Australia at the ongoing Twenty20 World Cup on home soil, retired from ODI cricket last month after a poor run of form with the bat.""It's a great honour,"" Cummins said. ""I want to publicly thank Aaron for all his efforts over the last few years, he's been a fantastic leader of our squad and the team's in a great place. Really excited for the next 12 months.""Warner was banned for life from leadership positions for his role in a 2018 Newlands ball-tampering scandal and could be considered for a vice-captaincy role if the punishment is commuted after a review.Cummins said on Sunday he was unlikely to feature in every ODI because of the number of matches Australia play in all formats, and that someone like Warner could step in when he was absent.""I don't expect Pat to play every one-day game in the lead-up to the World Cup,"" Bailey added.""I expect that we might see two or three guys taking the leadership for a game at some stage.""Bailey refused to speculate on whether Warner could be one of those players pending the review of his ban, but did say he fully endorsed the process.""I hope it happens in a timely manner, I think the longer it drags out just leads to speculation and I don't think that's helpful for David,"" he added.""Internally, I can't speak highly enough of what he brings to the group.""

/world/europe/news/tories-will-try-oust-truss-week-3145306,Tories will try to oust Truss this week,"British lawmakers will try to oust Prime Minister Liz Truss this week, a report said yesterday, as the government axed almost all of its debt-fuelled tax cuts unveiled last month to avert fresh markets chaos, in another humiliating blow for the embattled PM.More than 100 members of parliament (MPs) belonging to the governing Conservative Party are ready to submit letters of no confidence in Truss to Graham Brady, the head of the Conservative Party's committee which organises the leadership contest, the Daily Mail reported, quoting unnamed sources.Britain, engulfed in a political crisis, has lost three prime ministers since it voted to leave the European Union in 2016.The MPs will urge Brady to tell Truss that ""her time is up"" or to change the political party rules to allow an immediate vote of confidence in her leadership, the report said.Brady is said to be resisting the move, arguing that the Truss, along with newly appointed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, deserve a chance to set out economic strategy in a budget on Oct. 31, the report added.Separately, The Times reported that some lawmakers have held secret discussions on replacing Truss with a new leader.Truss, who won the Conservative Party leadership last month after promising to slash taxes, is fighting for her political survival after ditching key parts of the programme.The chaos has fuelled discontent in the party, which is falling behind the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls.New finance chief Jeremy Hunt's move to axe almost all of its debt-fuelled tax cuts leaves Truss' position in a precarious state after a series of embarrassing U-turns.Hunt estimated the tax changes would raise about £32 billion ($36 billion) per year, after economists estimated the government faced a £60-billion black hole. He also warned of tough spending cuts.The chancellor of the exchequer said no government could control markets -- but stressed his action would give certainty over public finances and help secure growth.""We will reverse almost all the tax measures announced... three weeks ago,"" Hunt said in a televised statement, conceding last month's budget from his predecessor had harmed the public purse.""The most important objective for our country right now is stability,"" he added in a contrite statement, ahead of setting out further details in parliament later yesterday.Hunt scrapped plans to axe the lowest rate of income tax, and curbed the government's flagship energy price freeze -- pulling the plug in April instead of late 2024.After April, his department will ""review"" its energy support package, he said.A proposed reduction in shareholder dividend tax was also binned, along with planned tax-free shopping for tourists and a freeze on alcohol duty.Hunt's action sent the British pound jumping to $1.1346, while bond yields dipped.Last month's notorious budget had sent bond yields spiking and the pound collapsing to a record dollar-low on fears of rocketing UK debt.Tax reductions were the centrepiece of the ill-fated budget, but they were financed via huge borrowing.Truss had already staged two embarrassing budget U-turns, scrapping tax cuts for the richest earners and on company profits.Hunt already stated that he was not taking anything off the table"" amid speculation of cutbacks on areas like defence, hospitals and schools."

Nurul asked.Echoing the same, fisher Shukur Ali  said he has no savings left and cannot carry on for a single day without venturing into the river.""Every year we receive some sort of help  from the government.

The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.The head of the national railways, Alexander Kamyshin, confirmed attacks ""near"" the capital's central rail hub.""We need more air defence systems and as soon as possible. More weapons,"" Zelensky's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on social media.Also yesterday, Nato launched regular nuclear deterrence drills in western Europe, which were planned before Russia invaded Ukraine, rejecting calls to scrap the exercises after Putin ratcheted up veiled threats to launch a nuclear attack.The exercises will involve US B-52 long-range bombers, and up to 60 aircraft in total will take part in training flights over Belgium, the United Kingdom and the North Sea.In Geneva, new UN rights chief Volker Turk voiced alarm about Monday's fresh Russian attacks, insisting that civilians must be protected.""Any escalation in warfare is deeply troubling to us,"" Turk told reporters in Geneva on his first day on the job. ""It is absolutely important that civilian objects, civilians, are not targeted"", he said.In Moscow, the city's mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced that Russian army draft offices would close from yesterday, saying the Kremlin's mobilisation quotas to recruit reservists to fight in Ukraine had been completed in the capital."
