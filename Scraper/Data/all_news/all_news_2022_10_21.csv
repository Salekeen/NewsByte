/entertainment/tv-film/news/mehzeb-chowdhury-pioneer-criminology-savant-films-3147896,"Mehzeb Chowdhury – pioneer in criminology, savant in films ","Mehzeb Chowdhury is best known for his invention of MABMAT, a Mars Rover-like invention that aids crime scene analysis which modernised the field. However, the Bangladesh-origin prodigy is also a member of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA's) 'The Connect' programme for his contribution to the British film industry as a cinematographer and screenwriter.Recently, he and two fellow BAFTA members made the South Asian Film, Television and Arts Collective (SAFTAC), a vivid community of South Asian talents who help each other. The multi-talented Mehzeb, who is also a musician, author, and painter, talked to The Daily Star over the phone for an interview.""In my teens, I idolised Leonardo da Vinci, who was an inventor, painter, sculptor, and an engineer. I was fascinated by all his talents, and a few years later, I worked on my repertoire of skills"".  Mehzeb came to UK to take the bar exam in 2010, and then went back to Bangladesh to work at a law firm for two years. In 2012, he went to Durham University to do Masters in Criminology and Criminal justice. Although he had been leading a wonderful life in Bangladesh pursuing law and sports journalism, his artistic brilliance received 'wings' when he arrived in the UK.""I was intrigued by the world of criminology when I started reading ""The Little Sister"" by Raymond Chandler in 2000. This book captured by my imagination for detective stories and a sprout of 'forensic science' started growing in my heart,"" he said. ""At that time, the popularity of 'CSI' was at its peak, I was engrossed by the crime scene investigation in the show.""The now 'Doctor' Mehzeb works as an Assistant Professor of Policing at Northumbria University.Mehzeb's greatest invention was heralded in 2016 when he developed MABMAT. However, he does not actually have any engineering experience at all.""I was inspired by the Mars Rover, that I saw on one of NASA's channels. It immediately struck me – a similar invention can actually be used in the crime scene!"" Mehzeb used acronyms from his parents' initials to make the name 'MAMBAT'.In 2017, Mehzeb worked as a cinematographer for the feature film 'Redemption', directed by Edward Collier.Thanks to his invention, the artiste caught the attention of BAFTA, when he became the only cinematographer in the Northeast to be included in the in the 2019/20 Crew directory. Mehzeb has now been accepted into the (BAFTA) Connect programme, for his contribution to British film industry.""I got into filmmaking when I was doing my PHD at Durham University -- we have a strong film society established at the premises.  We made a couple of short films which did quite well at the film festival circuit. We managed to get into prestigious film festivals like Sundance Collab and Sundance TV and thus when I applied to BAFTA crew programme, which gave me the opportunity to be mentored by Linus Sandgren, who was the cinematographer for ""La La Land"" and ""First Man"", he said.""Around 2021, I started doing screenwriting, among which some projects premiered at Raindance Film Festival. ""Remind me Yesterday"" won the best sci-fi film at Berlin Film Festival and also secured the second spot at the Raindance festival. It was directed by Aleksandra Czenczek. I also worked with director Michaela Moir for ""Downtime"", which was showcased at numerous festivals as well. The sort of fanfare around the two movies cemented my portfolio and thus when the time for BAFTA connect programme came, I was selected. This gave me a good recognition of the work that I have been trying to do for the last 6 years,"" added the young inventor.Mehzeb is writing the screenplay for his debut feature film, which focuses on a dystopian, futuristic setting. He wants to hire hero of South Asian as the main lead as there is negligible representation of them in Hollywood.""In the past, I wanted to be an actor but when I got into this industry, I realised that representation really matters. I really want younger people to look at cinemas and think that they could be that person. I started an organisation with two of my fellow BAFTA crew members Haresh Patel and Shawn Basheer, called South Asian Film Television and Arts Collective (SAFTAC). We are all founding directors, and we have been able to do some amazing works representing South Asian creatives interest in UK and USA,"" he mentioned. SAFTAC now has over 1000 members.Mehzeb had been recognised for almost everything that he has done, but he has reservations about his own paintings.""In the last couple of years, I have got emails and messages about people wanting to buy my art. My target is to create two canvases at the end of the year. The template has always been Leonardo, and I will never be a good painter that he is. I want to give social messages through my paintings which touch upon themes like racism, and the subjugation of women in Afghanistan,"" he added.Mehzeb has also formed a band called 'Megalithic' along with his Irish friend Alex McDonell. The album centres around a mixture of genres including indie rock pop to metal. They were featured on a website called Emerging Indie Bands, and a 50-year-old French Heavy Metal magazine."
/opinion/views/news/space-the-final-frontier-superpower-rivalry-3148591,Is space the final frontier of superpower rivalry?,"The Hollywood film The Martian (2015, 20th Century Fox) is an inspiring story of how collaboration in space can help everyone. A crewed mission to Mars leaves the planet in a hurry to avoid an imminent storm, mistakenly leaving behind one of their astronauts Mark Watney. Back on earth, mission control considers him dead, only to find that Watney has survived by sheer ingenuity. NASA plans to detour another mission to rescue Watney. But it is too risky, and time is running out. The Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA) scientists are also watching the situation. Their till then classified booster rocket can help bring Watney back and they offer to do so. After a highly complex manoeuvre and intense happy-ending drama à la Hollywood, Watney returns.But such collaborations between the two space powers can happen only in movies because Americans enacted a law in 2011 to stop just that. Republican Congressman Frank Wolf introduced a bill to bar NASA and all other American agencies from working with Chinese organisations. The bill, known as the Wolf Amendment, practically blocks all avenues of collaboration between the two most active space players. The battle for economic, technological, and geopolitical superiority has thus gone to space. In the International Space Station (ISS), Washington has deliberately excluded Beijing where hundreds of astronauts from 19 nations including Moscow have participated.However, instead of stalling, such exclusions have only persuaded Beijing to build its own space station, the Tiangong, which is scheduled for completion this year. The plan for ISS is decommissioning in 2024, and if the US and its partners do not extend its life, Tiangong may become the only crewed outpost in orbit. China has invited all nations to join it, but the Wolf Amendment will bar NASA astronauts from doing so even if they want to.China is a late entrant in the space race. It put the first satellite into orbit in 1970 after which there wasn't much progress for a long time. It has, however, caught up and in the past 10 years, launched more than two hundred crewed and uncrewed spaceships. In December 2020, it sent an uncrewed mission, Chang'e 5, to the Moon to collect rock samples from a site not visited by any other nation before. China's progress in space has so far been stunning, which General John Raymond, chief of space operations of the US Space Force has summarised as ""from zero to 60 really quick."" China also completed its own satellite navigation system BeiDou in 2020, offering complete global navigation service like America's GPS, Europe's Galileo, and Russia's GNSS. On January 2, 2019, China landed a space probe on the dark side of the moon, which no other nation has done yet. In July, China's first successful interplanetary mission completed mapping the Red Planet a little over a year after its arrival.China's fast-progressing space technology has raised concerns that it can be used as a weapon against enemy satellites. Space technology is inherently dual-purpose and can power low-end reversible jammers, direct energy weapons such as lasers, and direct-ascent kinetic missiles which can destroy any satellite in orbit. Judging from the developments so far, it is quite likely that China already owns such weapons for use in a conflict. Fuelling such speculations further, China destroyed a defunct weather satellite with a missile in 2007 producing a large amount of space debris. Last year, its researchers successfully tested an anti-satellite robotic device, which can produce a time-controlled, steady explosion with little or no debris.All these unmissably point to how China's space technology is leapfrogging and may soon catch up with the Americans, though not all experts agree. Until now the USA is ahead of China in the space race and is likely to remain so in the coming years. Despite China sending more rockets in 2021, America's total number of satellites and payload capacities in orbit far exceeds those of China. The other advantage Washington enjoys over Beijing is the active role played by a thriving commercial space industry, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin (SpaceX provides internet to Ukraine's forces and Iranian protesters).These facts are, however, of little comfort to Washington as it, along with its allies, is trying to stall or at least slowdown Beijing's progress in every possible way. In 2020, SSC Space Australia (a subsidiary of Swedish Space Corporation) declared that it won't extend the contract for China to use its space tracking station in Western Australia. Beijing, however, has already made alternative arrangements with another such station in Kiribati.The most recent battle in the space war is being fought on the moon, as both nations plan to set up lunar bases for long-term settlements and resource exploitation. In August, NASA's Artemis 3 and CNSA'a Chang'e-7 missions released their lists of potential landing sites only to find that some of them overlap. How they come to an agreement on this issue is yet to be seen.Will it be possible for Washington to stall Beijing's progress in space technology? Is cooperation a more pragmatic choice than competition? Will Washington remove the legal bars that prevent cooperation? Given the successive American administrations' policies towards China (Obama's China containment policy, Trump's trade war, and Biden's chip war), presently that seems unlikely. Meanwhile, China continues its space odyssey as Tiangong's final module is ready to blast off.Dr Sayeed Ahmed is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation."
/sports/cricket/news/tigers-first-opponent-unveiled-netherlands-qualify-3148031,Tigers’ first opponent unveiled as Netherlands qualify,"With the Group A qualification saga coming to end yesterday, Bangladesh can start analysing the Netherlands as the Tigers are set to begin their T20 World Cup campaign against the Dutch side on 24th October in Hobart.Despite falling short by 16 runs against Sri Lanka, the Dutch cemented their place in the Super 12s as runners-up behind the Lankans, courtesy of UAE downing Namibia by seven runs in the second and final match of the day on Thursday.The results mean that Bangladesh, who were scheduled to face the Group A runners-up in their tournament opener, will meet Netherlands after six years following the two sides' T20 World Cup affair in Dharamsala in 2016, where the Tigers rode on Tamim Iqbal's 58-ball 83 to edge their counterparts by eight runs in the preliminary round of the mega event.Moving on to Group B proceedings, West Indies take on Ireland, while the evening match will see Zimbabwe face Scotland. As all four teams are tied on two points, the equation is simple as the respective winners of today's games ensure a Super 12 spot.However, if bad weather spoils both games, Zimbabwe and Scotland would go through based on superior net run-rates over West Indies and Ireland.So far, the two-time champions West Indies managed to down Zimbabwe to keep their qualification hopes alive following a shell-shocking defeat to Scotland. The Caribbeans are yet to produce a polished performance, struggling to live up to the tag of T20 specialists and lacking firepower that the big hitters promise.Against Ireland, Windies are in for a tough hurdle as the Irish have momentum on their back as they are fresh off a remarkable turnaround against the Scottish, where Curtis Campher and George Dockrell rose from the ashes to stage a match-winning stand when all hope seemed lost.Meanwhile, Scotland, despite their death-bowling misfiring against Ireland, would not feel demoralised against a spirited Zimbabwe. The game promises to be a cracker as the two sides have demonstrated sparks of fine form across all departments. SCORES IN BRIEF

/news/bangladesh/news/energy-economic-crises-they-may-extend-beyond-year-3148066,"Energy, economic crises may drag on beyond a year: CPD","The economic and energy crises that Bangladesh is facing may extend beyond a year, the Centre for Policy Dialogue said yesterday.The measures the government has taken to ride out these crises -- dollar crunch, energy shortfall, food insecurity, and soaring inflation -- are mostly on the right path. But they are inadequate and short-term in nature while the problems are likely to persist for the medium term, it noted.To overcome the crises, the independent think-tank recommended cost-effective production and employment-oriented measures, and also called for focusing on spending in areas that will benefit the poor.It suggested the government form a committee to monitor the key economic indicators and come up with policy advice and actions to tackle the growing crises.The committee will be comprised of representatives from the Prime Minister's Office, the ministries of finance, planning, commerce, power and energy, food, and agriculture as well as civil society members.The CPD yesterday unveiled its review on the challenges the country's economy is facing amid a global economic slowdown.""We are not going to get rid of the problems even in 2023. One cannot expect we will be free from these crises within the next one year,"" CPD Executive Director Fahmida Khatun told a press briefing at its office in the city.The nature of the current crises is global, and the world economy is adversely impacted by the challenges stemming from inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Covid pandemic.Mentioning that some domestic problems aggravated the crises in Bangladesh, she noted that the country's internal policies and plans should be strong, corruption removed and good governance ensured.All countries are facing the heat of the current global crisis but the ones whose internal policies are strong will fare better, she said.Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the CPD, said, ""The government has taken some steps to overcome the crises, considering them as short-term. We, however, are facing medium and long-term crises… if the problems are not addressed properly, they may lead to a job crisis and then to a political crisis.""Replying to a query, he said the government can take long-term loans from the International Monetary Fund or abroad to expand the fiscal space. The use of funds, however, should be proper.If funds are misused and capital is siphoned off abroad, the country will face even deeper problems, he pointed out.Had the government taken reform measures when the economy was in a better shape, it could have got more fiscal space and been in a better position to handle the situation.""But it [the government] spent over Tk 26,000 crore in the name of capacity charge for power companies in the last fiscal year… Many of the owners of those companies became rich but the government's fiscal space shrank.""Answering a question on food security, Moazzem said the food-importing countries will be in trouble if they face dollar shortage.Moreover, the government should focus on increasing food production and storage capacity, as food is now becoming a ""political commodity"" globally.""Agricultural subsidies should rise,"" he added.About the recent price hike, the CPD said the poor and low-income earners are facing increased hardship, as the living cost has been soaring since the spread of Covid in early 2020.These people continue to struggle because the burden of rising prices weighs more heavily on their meagre incomes.It is urgent to revisit and revise the minimum wages of workers in all industries immediately, according to the CPD.Private companies should consider a higher salary increment for all their employees to help them maintain their living standards.About the energy crisis, the think-tank said the power and energy sector is suffering the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war and the pandemic. Factories are not getting enough gas and electricity to carry on production as usual.The industries, especially gas-dependent textile, ceramics, glass, and steel factories, are struggling to meet the production targets.Recently, oil-exporting countries decided to cut oil production, which may put more pressure on Bangladesh since it is heavily dependent on imported petroleum.Based on a calculation, the CPD said Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation has been making profits since August.The BPC should revise down the fuel prices to help reduce inflationary pressure on the domestic market, the think-tank said, adding that Bangladesh took mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce energy use but hasn't given enough attention to renewables-based power generation.Falling forex reserves continue to be a cause for concern as it depleted to $36.3 billion as of October 12 due to high import bills and slow growth in remittance earnings. It was $41.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2021-22, the CPD said.It recommended ensuring market-based floating exchange rate to help improve the situation."

/opinion/editorial/news/austerity-people-luxury-govt-officials-3148561,"Austerity for people, but luxury for govt officials? ","The recent decision to build ""luxurious residences"" at the cost of Tk 42.85 crore for the cabinet and principal secretaries by the housing and public works ministry is one of the most outrageous decisions that has been taken by this government in recent times – and that is saying a lot. At a time when government high-ups, including the prime minister herself, have been repeatedly telling the public to practise austerity, under what justification did the government undertake such a project? Why should the public be suffering under strict austerity measures, while government high-ups enjoy such luxury? Such an atrociously expensive project funded by the taxpayers' money makes a mockery of the so-called austerity measures. Are we living in a democratic system where you have citizens and public representatives, or are we back to living in feudal times, where you had lords and ladies living in their big mansions, while the peasants and serfs were left to fend for their own safe drinking water? For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Are we living in a democratic system where you have citizens and public representatives, or are we back to living in feudal times, where you had lords and ladies living in their big mansions, while the peasants and serfs were left to fend for their own safe drinking water?Project documents indicate that the estimated cost of the two three-storey buildings is Tk 18.88 crore. Another Tk 22.5 crore will be spent on the interior and exterior designs and a service building. Each of the three-storey buildings will be built on 18,000 square feet, and will have two swimming pools, which would cost another estimated Tk 5.1 crore. When half of Dhaka city does not have safe drinking water, why do public servants need such huge swimming pools in their houses? Are we living in a democratic system where you have citizens and public representatives, or are we back to living in feudal times, where you had lords and ladies living in their big mansions, while the peasants and serfs were left to fend for their own safe drinking water? This project makes it look like we are living in the latter system. We understand that top secretaries should have houses. But why should it cost taxpayers nearly Tk 43 crore? Even if we were living in normal times – and not in a time when there is a severe economic crisis – how can such a project be justified? Are we one of the richest countries in the world that such luxury should be afforded to public servants? We just cannot believe what we are reading and seeing in regard to this proposal. And we really fail to understand the mindset of the people who had the audacity to propose it, let alone those who approved it. This project, in many ways, reflect the general tendency of the government to waste thousands of crores of taka at a time when the country's economy and the people in general are suffering. While people are being told to swallow the austerity pill, we see no sign of government officials cutting back on their own costs or trying to be more efficient when it comes to completing different government projects using taxpayers' money.We strongly call on the government to scrap this project, and get rid of such a ludicrous idea altogether."

/opinion/views/news/the-perennial-shadow-communalism-3148641,The perennial shadow of communalism,"Seventy-five years after the Partition of the Indian subcontinent, we are still a long way from understanding the complex ways in which this event affected the everyday lives of people and communities then, and how it still continues to shape our collective consciousness, politics and ways of being. This series, featuring scholars of partition studies from across the subcontinent – and to be published every Saturday – is an attempt at exploring the complexities and contradictions of the momentous event that forever changed the contours of this region. This article, the third in the series, examines the scars of communalism left on the people in the subcontinent, and what the future might hold.On August 14, as part of the celebrations for Pakistan's 75th anniversary of independence, the Pakistani government released a re-recorded video of the country's national anthem. Compared to the old one, the updated version of the anthem reveals Pakistan's willingness to embrace its diversity and plurality, which was previously absent in the face of Muslim nationalism. This version highlights Pakistan's regional, linguistic, and religious diversity elaborately. However, a few days later, an incident in Hyderabad exposed the fault lines in Pakistani society on a much deeper level. On August 20, an angry mob surrounded a residential building at Hyderabad in Sindh province, demanding custody of a low-caste Hindu sweeper accused of desecrating the Quran. Police and rangers later dispersed the mob, preventing a potential lynching.On the other side of the border, as India celebrated the 75th anniversary of independence, the Indian state of Gujarat set 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano rape case free. Later, relatives and members of Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) gave these convicts a hero's welcome. Bano, an Indian Muslim woman, was gang-raped and 14 members of her family were murdered in front of her by a Hindu mob during the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat. One of the jurists, also a legislator from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), iterated that the convicts were ""Brahmins and have exemplary behaviour."" The evolution of India's second state has almost culminated under the rule of BJP, which has been in power since 2014. India's ideological turn has alarmed the world regarding the future of its Muslim minority. Additionally, it raises serious questions about the future of the secular state in India.Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation that is officially classified as secular, also has a history of majoritarian violence against minorities. One needs to ask what exactly is producing this violence in these South Asian countries once ruled by the British Empire.Communal violence is not a recent phenomenon in this part of the world. The trajectory of modern communal violence in India can be traced back to the colonial period, which resulted in the division of the subcontinent into Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India in 1947. As a result, about 15 million South Asians were uprooted. Approximately two million people were killed. The grisly violence that broke out in the region included rape, abduction, and conversion to other faiths. The event known as Partition of British India was a long and complicated process. While some people immediately migrated and became refugees in their new countries, others were forced to leave as they witnessed the escalation of communal politics in their respective regions. The violence was not limited to only Hindus and Muslims. Scholars have shown how South Asians used to have fluid religious, regional, and linguistic identities before the British intervention hardened their identities. During colonial rule, governance tools such as censuses, the constitution of India (1935), and the production of colonial knowledge contributed to the hardening of communal fault lines in the subcontinent. The secularisation of religion as well as the partition of Bengal in 1905, the grant of separate electorates in 1909, and the Communal Award in 1932 helped fuel the communal divide in British India. During colonial rule, almost all major religious traditions underwent reform movements that resulted in further tightening of religious identities.The All India Muslim League's campaign for a separate homeland for Muslims was driven by fear of becoming a minority in a Hindu-majority India. However, postcolonial nationalism had other fault lines besides religion, including race, caste, language, community, and regionalism. The meanings of home, homeland, belonging, citizenship, majority, and minority in South Asia profoundly changed in the 1950s as a result of these complex historical processes. As new nations were imagined, they were based on majoritarianism, resulting in the expulsion of unwanted ""others"" from their homelands. In both Pakistan and India, a culture of communalism dominated and defined by the major religious communities played an integral part in clearing national space.Due to the internal fault lines, Partition was not the final cleavage of the region that became Pakistan. A staunch supporter of the Pakistan movement, East Pakistan, decided to part ways 24 years after the Partition. This meant that South Asia's Muslim leaders could not continue their political understanding that agreed upon the establishment of Pakistan in 1947. East Pakistan's secession in 1971 was the result of the fully evolved Bangalee Muslim identity and their demand for equal political rights. This led to the emergence of a third sovereign country in South Asia. Thus, while both India and Pakistan celebrate their 75th independence this year, Bangladesh marks its journey differently.Demanded as a separate homeland for Muslims in British India, Pakistan was dreamt by its founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, as a modern Muslim state. Jinnah's vision was short-lived as the politics of Islamic identity became an influential feature of state-making in Pakistan. Pakistan declared itself an Islamic republic on March 23, 1956. A gradual Islamisation of the country not only resulted in the continued hostility towards the recognised religious minorities, but also led to the creation of new religious ""other"" and their persecution and exclusion from public and political spheres. Recently, the Pakistani state's claim to be ""an Islamic"" state has also received backlash from Islamic parties and militants, questioning its legitimacy over its ""Islamicness.""Meanwhile, India has its own complex issues to deal with. For almost 75 years, India has positioned itself as the world's largest secular democracy, but the current wave of Hindu extremism and violence against Muslims and Dalits have exacerbated the oppression. Persecution of Muslims in India has sparked fears of a genocide. Not too long ago, the organised violence against Sikhs and Muslims had shaken the world. It is not difficult to predict where things are headed in India soon after years of debate and doubt about the origins of Muslims in the country. One thing is clear: communal violence is fuelled by the ideological narrative everywhere in the region – whether it's Bangladesh, India or Pakistan. It can be state or other religious actors building the narrative, excluding the people of other faiths or sects.Despite the Partition to resolve British India's communal problem, the three post-colonial states have not been able to eradicate it. Sectarian violence in the 1980s is still fresh in the minds of Pakistanis, as are memories of the Babri Masjid demolition, Gujarat incidents in India, and violence against Sikhs. Recently, there were incidents of mob violence against Hindus in Bangladesh. As a matter of fact, the post-partition social history of Hindu communities in Bangladesh has not been preserved properly.In South Asia, minoritised citizens face a very difficult situation. There is no need for me to write further about it. My research has involved interviewing minoritised communities in three South Asian countries to find out what it is like to be marginalised. It has never been described as a pleasant experience. For decades, religious exclusivism has been a cause of hate and violence in our region, and in some cases, it has taken the form of fascism.At the 75th anniversary of the Partition of British India that brought on unprecedented violence, loss of precious human lives, rapes, murders, and an unimaginable price that people, known and unknown to us, paid for freedom, it is now up to us to rethink and reinvent communal life in our respective countries. Given how caste and class intersect with communal violence in our region, this is not an easy task. However, we must recognise that the future of this region has a direct connection to the future of human life. It might be a good idea to eliminate majority and minority categories on the electoral level. However, will it be enough to resolve the conflicts between some religious groups?I must admit that I do not see this happening in India, where the state's ideology further marginalises Muslims and pushes them down the socioeconomic ladder. As far as I can tell, this will not happen in Pakistan either, where the government has legislated to maintain religious differences, making some religious actors openly pursue the politics of hate and persecution. The task will remain equally challenging for Bangladesh. Beyond increasing religious literacy among their respective populations, states must protect minorities from majoritarian violence in the long run. Dr Sadia Mahmood is assistant professor at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, Pakistan.

The two outcomes means that Bangladesh are not set to face the Netherlands in their tournament opener in Hobart on October 24. The Africans would have joined Sri Lanka in the next round rather than the Dutch had they won, but against the odds, the UAE restricted them to 141-8 as they chased 149 for victory.While a crushing disappointment for Namibia, getting a first-ever win was a huge confidence booster for UAE.Zahoor Khan and Basil Hameed grabbed two wickets each as the UAE reduced Namibia to 69-7 in the 13th over before late fireworks from David Weise (55 off 36 balls) set up a tense last-over finale.""A great moment for UAE cricket.

We are requesting them again and again,"" Momen said, adding that Dhaka will continue keeping pressure on China to resolve the crisis.China has been playing a mediator role in the last four years between Bangladesh and Myanmar to find a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis under a tripartite mechanism.The hour-long meeting between the foreign minister and the Chinese envoy was held at the State Guesthouse Padma while today's discussion was confined to only Rohingya issues.Ambassador Jiming at a recent event indicated that they are going to formally share the ""feedback"" with the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry based on what they talked with the Myanmar side.The foreign minister said Dhaka wants to see a quick and sustainable solution to the Rohingya crisis.""I am always a very optimistic person,"" Momen said.Since August 25 in 2017, Bangladesh has been hosting over 1.2 million forcefully displaced Rohingyas in Cox's Bazar district and most of them arrived there after a military crackdown by Myanmar, which the UN called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" and other rights groups dubbed as ""genocide""."

The job cuts are expected in the coming months, no matter who owns the company, according to the Washington Post report.Twitter's current management planned to pare the company's payroll by about $800 million by the end of next year, a number that would mean the departure of nearly a quarter of the workforce, the report said.Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Human resources staff at the social media company have told employees that they were not planning for mass layoffs, but documents showed extensive plans to push out staff and cut down on infrastructure costs were already in place before Musk offered to buy the company, the Washington Post reported.Musk had tried to walk away from the deal to buy Twitter in May alleging the company understated the number of bot and spam accounts on the social media platform, which started a series of lawsuits between the two parties."

/news/world/uk/news/boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-top-contenders-uk-pm-3148661,"Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak top contenders for UK PM","Boris Johnson and his former finance minister Rishi Sunak were leading potential contenders to replace British Prime Minister Liz Truss on Friday, with candidates canvassing support to become Conservative Party leader in a fast-tracked contest.Truss, chosen by party members to succeed Johnson after he was ousted by his lawmakers in July, quit herself on Thursday after six turbulent weeks in power.Those who want to replace her must secure 100 nominations from Conservative lawmakers by Monday to run in a contest which the party hopes will reset its ailing fortunes.With opinion polls suggesting the Conservatives would be all but wiped out if a national election were held now, the race is on to become the fifth British premier in six years. An election is not due to be held for two years.The winner will be announced on Monday or next Friday.In what would be an extraordinary comeback, Johnson, who remains popular with party members was being touted alongside Sunak as a likely candidate.""He can turn it around again. And I'm sure my colleagues hear that message loud and clear,"" Conservative lawmaker Paul Bristow told LBC radio. ""Boris Johnson can win the next general election.""But Johnson, who left office comparing himself to a Roman dictator twice brought into power to fight crises, might not reach the 100 nomination threshold after his three-year premiership was blighted by scandals and allegations of misconduct.The Financial Times said a Boris comeback would be ""farcical"".One of his former advisers, who no longer speaks to Johnson and requested not to be identified, said he was unlikely to reach the target, having alienated dozens of Conservative lawmakers.Will Walden, who also once worked for Johnson, said the former leader was returning from holiday and taking soundings.Business minister Jacob Rees-Mogg tweeted his support, using the hashtag ""#Borisorbust"".Defence Secretary Ben Wallace ruled himself out of the running and said he was leaning towards backing Johnson, who led the party to a large majority at a 2019 national election.Sunak, the former Goldman Sachs analyst who became finance minister just as the Covid-19 pandemic arrived in Europe and was runner-up to Truss in the summer's leadership contest, is the favourite with bookmakers, followed by Johnson.Third-placed is Penny Mordaunt, a former defence minister popular with party members who came third last time. None have formally declared their candidacy.A Reuters tally of Conservative lawmakers who have made public declarations of support put Sunak on 54 backers, Johnson on 29 and Mordaunt on 16.Britain's shortest-serving prime minister, Truss quit after her economic plans were rejected by investors, hitting the pound and pushing up borrowing costs, forcing a U-turn under a new finance minister after she sacked her closest political ally.The sight on Thursday of yet another unpopular prime minister making a resignation speech in Downing Street - and the start of a new leadership race - underscored how volatile British politics has become since the 2016 Brexit vote.Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said Brexit had brought instability to Britain.""I hope that they will soon be stable because even if they are not a family member anymore they are a friend and a neighbour. We need them and they need us too,"" he told reporters on arrival for an EU summit in Brussels.The Conservative Party has a big majority in parliament and can ignore calls for an election, but opposition parties, some newspapers and even a few of its own lawmakers have said voters should now be given a say.""The Tories (Conservatives) cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,"" Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said.""They do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment.""Some Conservative lawmakers have urged colleagues to coalesce around one candidate to minimise the bruising.Sunak, who had warned that Truss's fiscal plan threatened the economy, remains unpopular with some party members after he helped to trigger the rebellion against Johnson.Mordaunt is seen as a fresh face, largely untainted by earlier administrations but is also untested.The next leader will inherit an economy heading for recession, with rising interest rates and inflation over 10% leaving millions facing a cost-of-living squeeze.Surveys on Friday showed British shoppers have reined in their spending sharply and put their confidence levels near record lows, while worse-than-expected public borrowing figures underscored the economic challenges ahead.Truss's spokeswoman said work was continuing on a fiscal plan due to be set out on October 31 but that it would be for her successor to decide whether to proceed with it.Whoever takes over also has a mountain to climb to restore the party's own reputation.""Whether or not a change of leader is going to be sufficient to make the Conservatives actually electorally credible is certainly highly debatable,"" political scientist John Curtice told LBC."

/business/economy/news/tea-production-hits-record-3148356,Tea production hits record,"Bangladesh's tea production surged to a record high of 14.74 million kilogrammes (kgs) in September this year, according to state-run Bangladesh Tea Board (BTB).Year-on-year, this is an increase of about 17 per cent.The previous record was of October 2021, when 14.58 million kgs were produced.The BTB attributed it to favourable weather, distribution of subsidised fertiliser, regular monitoring of the Ministry of Commerce and BTB and efforts of garden owners and workers overcoming a labour strike in August.Garden owners earlier had claimed that the strike would affect production and cause losses in business.The tea workers went on a two-hour strike every day from August 9 demanding an increase in wages.Afterwards, they embarked on an indefinite strike in gardens across the country from August 13.Later, a meeting between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and representatives of garden owners fixed the minimum daily wage of workers at Tk 170. Earlier it was Tk 120.Though workers returned to work, there is resentment among a lot of them for different conditions attached to the daily wage and facilities claimed to be provided by garden owners mostly not being what it was in reality.Although the strike temporarily halted production, work quickly resumed at gardens, said Maj Gen Md Ashraful Islam, chairman of the BTB.Production is much better also for the increase in workers' wages and for labour welfare being ensured, Islam said.He added that the capacity of the industry has increased a lot due to the continuous efforts of garden owners, traders and workers along with various government initiatives.Tea production has expanded in Bangladesh over the past decade.About 96.51 million kgs were produced in 2021, up by some 54 per cent from that in 2012, shows the BTB data.This is the highest amount produced in a year in the 167-year history of the region's commercial tea cultivation.In the first nine months of 2022, 63.83 million kgs were produced in the country's 167 gardens.Omar Hannan, chairman of the Tea Traders Association of Bangladesh, said local consumption rises by 6 per cent to 7 per cent every year.In Bangladesh, 45 per cent of the tea produced is consumed at the household level while the rest at tea stalls, restaurants, and offices, according to industry insiders.Local tea brands dominate the domestic market with a 75 per cent share while non-branded producers account for the rest.The 167 tea gardens in the country cover almost 280,000 acres of land. Bangladesh is currently listed as the world's ninth largest tea producer, accounting for around 2 per cent of the world's total production.A total of 90 of the tea gardens are currently in Moulvibazar, which accounts for 55 per cent of the tea produced in the country. Habiganj is the second largest producer of tea, contributing 22 per cent. "

/news/world/uk/news/rishi-sunak-the-favourite-pick-next-uk-pm-3148236,Rishi Sunak the favourite pick for next UK PM,"To some Conservatives, Rishi Sunak is the minister who got Britain through the COVID pandemic, to others the traitor who knifed Boris Johnson or the rival to Liz Truss who presciently warned her tax plans would bring chaos.Now he has to weigh up whether he can convince Britain's governing party he is the man to save it from chaos.The former finance minister was runner-up in the last contest to become Britain's prime minister which only concluded six weeks ago, despite being the most popular candidate amongst Conservative lawmakers in parliament.But he was beaten by Liz Truss in the deciding vote by grassroots party members, with many blaming him for the downfall of their hero Boris Johnson.It was Sunak's dramatic decision to quit in July which set off a wave of resignations by ministers, ultimately forcing Johnson to reluctantly give up the top job in Downing Street.During the summer's leadership contest Sunak warned that Truss's tax cuts would cause a jump in borrowing costs, a message that proved to be correct as her economic programme triggered a bond market rout that led to her demise.With the Conservatives in turmoil, many in his party think he is the only one who can solve the party's woes.""He has the plan & credibility to restore financial stability, help get inflation down & deliver sustainable tax cuts over time; and unite the Conservatives by bringing the best talent into govt to deliver for the British people,"" former Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said on Twitter.For his supporters in the party, Sunak's previous leadership campaign message of the need for economic prudence to address Britain's rampant inflation and criticism of Truss's ""fairy tale"" plans have shown he is right man for the job.But he will have to weigh up whether he can overcome hostility from those in the party members who remain aggrieved by his perceived treachery over Johnson, and for raising Britain's tax burden to its highest in decades, just as the country was heading into a severe cost-of-living squeeze.OUT OF TOUCH?Accusations that he was an out-of-touch former hedge fund boss were heightened in April when his wife - the daughter of an Indian billionaire - confirmed reports that she had non-domiciled tax status in Britain, something she agreed to end.Betting firms have again made Sunak the front-runner to win the new contest although he was also the favourite in the race that Truss eventually won.The problems for Sunak in the leadership race contrasted with his swift rise through the Conservative Party, which began in 2015 when he was elected to parliament having previously worked for Goldman Sachs and hedge fund TCI.In 2020, aged 39, Sunak was named finance minister just before the coronavirus pandemic hit Britain. He dropped the Conservatives' small-state instincts to borrow massively and stave off the risk of an economic depression.That made him one of the most popular politicians in the country, as he was praised for helping businesses and workers.In one photograph that captured the sense of unity behind his rescue plans, Sunak posed outside his Downing Street office flanked by the heads of Britain's biggest trade union group and a leading employers' group.But that consensus disappeared as Britain emerged from the crisis saddled with an extra 400 billion pounds of debt and then fell into a cost-of-living crisis that led to even more demands on the public purse.Polls earlier this year showed his stock had fallen with the public, who were worried about the cost of living crisis and angered that he had raised payroll taxes while his wife had avoided British levies."

/news/bangladesh/news/housing-secretaries-luxury-the-time-austerity-3148146,Housing for secretaries: Luxury in the time of austerity,"The recent decision to build ""luxurious residences"" at the cost of Tk 42.85 crore for the cabinet and principal secretaries by the housing and public works ministry has drawn flak from different quarters.The widespread criticism comes at a time when people are repeatedly being advised to practise austerity to overcome the current economic crises.Experts say when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina herself has been repeatedly calling for cost cutting and restraint in public expenditure, such an atrociously expensive project funded by taxpayers' money is highly questionable.Former cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, ""I worked as [both] cabinet and principal secretaries, but I never felt the need for swimming pools or these many televisions [which are in the project proposal]. I never felt like I was in a sorry statewithout these.""In the Development Project Proposal (DPP), the Public Works Department, which is the implementing agency, claimed the project will create ""temporary employment opportunities"" during the implementation phase, which will ""help eradicate poverty to some extent"".Meanwhile, people from different quarters took to social media over the last couple of days to blast the initiative.Project documents indicatethe estimated cost of the two three-storey buildings is Tk 18.88 crore. Another Tk 22.5 crore will be spent on the interior and exterior designs and a service building.The Planning Commission, meanwhile, has decided to send the project proposal back to the housing and public works ministry, as it did not follow proper procedure, officials said.The ministry had directly sent the DPP to the physical planning, water supply and housing wing of the commission for approval, whereas it was supposed to be sent to the programming division, said an official, preferring anonymity.""It [the DPP] will now be sent back to the ministry.""According to the proper procedure, the proposal is first supposed to be sent to the programming division, which will then list it as an ""unapproved project"".It will then be sent to physical planning, water supply and housing wing, who will present it before the Project Evaluation Committee.""If the project then gets a nod and the cost is shown to be below Tk 50 crore, it is then presented to the planning minister for approval,"" the official said.Ali Imam Majumder suggested renovating existing residences and earmarking thoseas the homes of the cabinet and principal secretaries.""In terms of improvement, the sky is the limit. But this is not the right time. If their existing residences do not have enough facilities, these can be renovated at a reasonable cost,"" he said, adding that the project should be halted right away.According to the DPP, each of the three-storey building will be built on 18,000 square feetand will cost Tk 21.5 crore.There will be two swimming pools in each, which would cost another estimated Tk 5.1 crore.In the project description, the ministry said there were no permanent residences for the cabinet and principal secretaries.The cabinet secretary currently lives in the official residence in the capital's Minto Road, while the principal secretary's official residence is in Gulshan.A total of 14 LED televisions will be purchased at Tk 900,000 for the proposed homes.As many as 32 CCTV systems will be bought for those at the cost of Tk 600,000, while Tk 1.75 crore will be spent for the fire extinguishing systems.The cost of the 1,000 kg lifts (European Standard) is estimated at Tk 1.55 crore.Moreover, Tk 18 lakh will be spent to conserve rainwater.For official purposes, meeting with diplomats and overall security, there will be separate buildings.Shafiqul Islam, additional chief engineer of the public works department, said, ""They are the top government officials. If they don't deserve such facilities, thenwho does?""It [the project] will not be implemented right now. By the timeit will be, the economic situation will become normal.""Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh, said if the government is respectful to its commitment to transparent and accountable governance, it will be impossible to justifythe project to the public.""The approval of the project will send a message to the people that the government itself is ridiculing the pledges of austerity, and it has no qualms in spending public money to fund the disproportionately luxurious lifestyle of public officials, whose salaries and benefits are borne by the already overburdened common people.""Asked about the logic behind the project at a time like this, an additional secretary of the housing ministry said, ""We don't do anything on our own. We only execute plans that come from the top level."""
/news/asia/south-asia/news/sri-lanka-trims-presidential-powers-constitutional-amendment-3148671,Sri Lanka trims presidential powers via constitutional amendment,"Sri Lanka's parliament on Friday passed a constitutional amendment aimed at trimming presidential powers, beefing up anti-corruption safeguards and helping to find a way out of the country's worst financial crisis since independence.Sri Lanka has struggled for months to find enough dollars to pay for essential imports such as fuel, food, cooking gas and medicine.Many Sri Lankans blame former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa for implementing multiple failed policies including tax cuts, a now-reversed ban on chemical fertilisers and delays in seeking IMF assistance that resulted in the country defaulting on its foreign debt for the first time in history.As a response to widespread protests, Rajapaksa had backed constitutional reforms that would reduce the powers of the executive presidency and allocate them to parliament in June. He resigned the next month after protesters stormed his office and residence.""This amendment will not only help bring about the system change demanded by Sri Lankans it will also help in securing an IMF programme and other international assistance to rebuild the economy,"" Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe told parliament.In September, Sri Lanka signed an early deal with the IMF for a loan of $2.9 billion, with pledges to improve regulations to fight corruption.Opposition parties and civil society representatives, however, have slammed the amendment as not far-reaching enough in promoting accountability and reducing government powers.""This is just tinkering with presidential powers and the amendment does not implement significant change,"" said Bhavani Fonseka, a senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a Colombo-based think tank.""The president still retains the power to prorogue parliament, to hold ministries and the constitutional council will still have mostly government appointees.""The amendment was passed with the required two-thirds majority."

He mentioned that they are training the Bangladeshi manpower for the RNPP.The prime minister thanked Russia, particularly the Rosatom DG, for extending support and continuing the construction work in full swing even during the Covid-19 pandemic.    "
/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/ukrainians-conserve-power-3148181,Ukrainians conserve power,"Ukrainians conserved electricity and some went without running water yesterday to ease pressure on the grid and allow the repair of infrastructure destroyed by Russian air strikes as Kyiv's forces advanced towards the city of Kherson.Although Ukraine is successfully prosecuting counter-offensives against Russian forces in the east and the south, it is struggling to protect power generating facilities and other utilities from Russian missile and drone strikes which appear designed to disrupt and demoralise as winter approaches.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of using energy and hunger as weapons.""Scorched earth tactics will not help Russia win the war. They will only strengthen the unity and resolve of Ukraine and its partners,"" Scholz told the German parliament.Russia's defence ministry said it was again targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure, a strategy it has stepped up since the appointment this month of Sergei Surovikin - nicknamed ""General Armageddon"" by the Russian media because of his alleged toughness - as commander of what Moscow called its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.Reuters journalists said five drones hit the southern port city of Mykolaiv yesterday, but it was unclear where they had exploded.Herman Halushchenko, the energy minister, told Ukrainian TV that Russia had carried out more than 300 air strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities since October 10.Much of the destruction has been inflicted by Russian drones, which Ukraine and the West say are Iranian-made, something Tehran denies.The EU yesterday imposed sanctions against three Iranian generals and an arms firm accused of supplying Iranian drones to Russia that have been used to bomb Ukraine.Meanwhile, people across Ukraine were trying to adapt after the government placed restrictions on electricity usage nationwide for the first time since Russia's February 24 invasion following a barrage of attacks which President Volodymr Zelensky said had struck a third of all power plants.Under the new energy-saving regime, power supply across Ukraine was restricted between 7:00 am and 11:00 pm. Ukraine's energy minister Halushchenko said the government was seeking a 20 percent reduction in energy use.Cities such as the capital Kyiv and Kharkiv announced curbs on the use of electric-powered public transport such as trolleybuses and reduced the frequency of trains on the metro.The whole northeast region of Sumy, which borders Russia, said it would go the entire day - from 0700 to 2300 local time - without water, electric transport or street lighting.""We need time to restore power plants, we need respite from our consumers,"" Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, head of grid operator Ukrenergo, told Ukrainian TV.Zelensky explained the need to conserve power in a Wednesday night video address: ""There is new damage to critical infrastructure. Three energy facilities were destroyed by the enemy today.""We assume that Russian terror will be directed at energy facilities until, with the help of partners, we are able to shoot down 100 percent of enemy missiles and drones.""While Ukraine remained tight-lipped about its operations, its military in an early yesterday update on the Kherson region said 43 Russian servicemen had been killed and six tanks and other equipment destroyed.The Russian defence ministry described a battle in the area which it said its forces had won."

/opinion/views/news/will-earth-remain-inhabitable-after-2050-3148491,Will Earth remain inhabitable after 2050?,"It is quite a dicey time for our planet. In the last 100 years or so, because of our unrestrained use of fossil fuels and systematic overexploitation of the natural resources, we have pushed the planet towards climatological catastrophe. Simply put, we dug ourselves into a deep hole, yet we have not stopped digging.To pull us out of the hole, world leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris Accords to keep the ""global temperature increase in this century to two degrees Celsius while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees."" In order to achieve this goal, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) wants us to halve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 and attain net zero emissions by 2050.With that in mind, our leaders are going to meet for the 27th time, from November 6-18, in Sharm el-Sheikh, a resort town in Egypt, to discuss an array of issues related to climate change and renew for the sixth time their commitment to deliver on the Paris Agreement.Realistically speaking, at the current pace of GHG emissions that is even faster than what was predicted in the early 21st century, and, more importantly, our leaders back-pedalling on the pledges made at the Paris conference, the blueprint for net zero emissions seems like a pipe dream. Under these circumstances, the state of our planet in 2050 seems frightening.In Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, as well as Europe and North America, summer will arrive months earlier, and with vengeance, as it did in 2021 and 2022. Persistent heat waves will afflict much of the population, resulting in hundreds of thousands of heat-related deaths. Furthermore, it is highly likely that the wet-bulb temperature will oftentimes surpass 35 degrees Celsius, which is the upper limit of human adaptability to heat and humidity. Extremely hot summers will mean more frequent, intense and wide-ranging forest fires burning more trees that will release more carbon dioxide, driving global temperatures even higher. The smog-filled filthy air will kill countless people living nearby. In addition to dirtier air, warmer weather will act as a catalyst for chemical reactions, producing many toxic pollutants, including ground-level ozone which, when inhaled, will aggravate respiratory conditions like asthma and emphysema.As the world warms, rainfalls in Bangladesh during monsoon will become more erratic, less predictable, frightfully dangerous, and immeasurably devastating. The recent cataclysmic floods in Bangladesh's Sylhet and Pakistan due to record monsoon rains and melting glaciers in the Himalayas indicate that by 2050, villages will become small islands in an inland sea. Besides floods, heavy and incessant rainfalls will trigger landslides that have already demolished many homes and claimed hundreds of lives in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and high mountain regions in Asia and elsewhere. In sum, the changing pattern of monsoon will put millions of people in peril.Augmented by rising sea levels, cyclonic storms will cause the coastal cliffs in Bangladesh, that act as natural barriers against high tides, to collapse. As a consequence, people living in low-lying coastal areas will experience incursions of seawater more often during storm surges, where freshwater supplies will be contaminated and undrinkable, agricultural land will be damaged because of increased salinity, and waterborne diseases will become increasingly common. Additionally, along with many coastal cities and island nations, a large portion of Bangladesh will be underwater.Massive build-up of heat will turn the high latitude regions of the northern hemisphere – within and outside the Arctic Circle – into wastelands. Inland glaciers, a major source of freshwater, will become a thing of the past. A hotter climate in the Arctic belt will impact the global climate system as a whole through the enhanced release of greenhouse gases, especially the highly potent methane, from thawed permafrost.According to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, global warming will turn more than 25 percent of the Earth into desert. The Sahara Desert will extend to parts of southern Europe. A warmer Earth will exacerbate droughts, mainly outside of the tropics, with far-reaching consequences. They will be drawn-out, leading to acute shortages of water and mass starvation in many parts of the world. Droughts will also drastically raise the number of climate refugees.The UN's International Office of Migration (IOM) speculates that by 2050, over a billion people will be displaced globally due to climate change. The number of people living in cities will likely triple. People in Dhaka, currently 22.5 million, can expect to rub their shoulders with an additional 13–15 million climate refugees.Food insecurity, dearth of water and energy, together with depleted resources, will provide the spark that will push otherwise peaceful nations into war. Moreover, famine, poverty, unstable governments, vast inequalities within societies, and control for life-sustaining resources will incite riots and civil wars.This is just a small glimpse into what our planet may look like in 2050. To keep our planet inhabitable beyond 2050, we need courageous, visionary leaders with new ideas. Arguably, most of the leaders of the major GHG-emitting nations lack these traits.So, what is the endgame? In January 2016, British-born American astronaut and climate scientist Piers Sellers wrote in The New York Times on his perspectives on climate change, ""There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks. History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots. The winners tended to be realistic, pragmatic, and flexible; the losers were often in denial of the threat.""Sellers' optimistic take on confronting climate change gives us hope for the future. Hence, the doom and gloom picture painted here is not the endgame, nor is it an inevitable future. However, because climate change cannot be curbed through established political systems controlled by the ""losers,"" concerned citizens have to shape the agenda through grassroots work. Otherwise, our planet will be thrown off its axis, plunging into an irreversible feedback loop of ever-hotter, ever-deadlier conditions. And by 2050, uninhabitability of the Earth may become a harsh reality.Dr Quamrul Haider is a professor of physics at Fordham University in New York, US.

/daily-star-books/news/post-ssc-reads-3148531,Post-SSC musings: Books that helped me navigate my vacation,"After my SSC exams ended, I felt that all my textbooks, notes, and past question papers were just staring at me. It was as if they were looking at me with the slightest bit of mockery. Despite the regret I felt for not studying them with honest academic interest, the goal of having to go through those academic books did provide me a sense of purpose. However, now that exams were over, I realised that I had to replace those mundane books with more fascinating ones.These books that I read and had helped me navigate the post-SSC days more adventurously.CIRCEMadeline Miller
Little, Brown and Company (2018)Circe, the daughter of Helios and the sorceress goddess, is famously known in Greek Mythology for turning Odysseus's crew into swine. The book Circe is written in Homeric narrative but concentrates heavily on the female gaze and how differently the tales will always be told by a man. Even though Odysseus plays a huge role in this story, the central, driving force in the story is Circe becoming her greatest self. We get to see her question what it means to be immortal, to be a nymph in a world ruled by gods, and what it means just to live. Madeline Miller's Circe is not a lovelorn, lonely heart desperate for connection in her isolation, but a multi-faceted character, with inner seams encompassing both dark and light. Her journey was unlike anything I had ever read before, and probably unlike anything I will ever read again.THE BELL JARSylvia Plath
Heinemann (1963)Sylvia Plath's only novel The Bell Jar is packed with bleak truths, difficult topics and wry, dark humour. The story is about a woman named Esther, who moves to New York City for an internship in a Fashion Magazine, while her mental health deteriorates in the process. She describes her depression as a suffocating feeling, like that of being in a bell jar. Plath's poetic prowess shows through her writing, especially the descriptions, and we understand how excruciatingly personal her poetry was. The book is often regarded as a roman á clef since the protagonist's descent into mental illness parallels Plath's own experiences. While reading, Esther made me her accomplice in her jokes and in her secrets, and made me empathise with her plights. Despite the darkness in which this book is immersed, a sense of hope still lingers even after finishing this sombre journey. I am grateful for the story Plath shared, and for the fate she forged for her character.A STRANGER IN MY OWN COUNTRY: EAST PAKISTAN, 1969-1971Khadim Hussain Raja
The University Press Limited (2012)As Khadim Hussain Raja was the second in command in then East Pakistan, a biassed yet nuanced perspective about Bangladesh's independence is shown in his writing. The nonchalant way in which he writes about ""neutralising"" political leaders, student hostels, teachers' residents, cultural groups, and ""disarming"" East Bengal Regiments, EPR, and the police, I found deplorable. Even though he criticises the Pakistani military government, he glosses over the hot mess they created while running the country and downplays the extent of their actions and impact. This book sheds light on a good amount of events and decisions at a higher level but with few references to some incidents on the streets. It left my blood boiling in rage.FIRE AND BLOODGeorge R. R. Martin
Bantam Books (2018)With the recent release of the HBO series House of the Dragon, this is the perfect time to read Fire and Blood and get truly immersed in the story. Fire and Blood details, as the title suggests, the history of the Targaryen Kings; this first volume spans the time from the reign of Aegon the Conqueror to his sixth successor Aegon III, who sat on the Iron Throne 130 years after Aegon the Dragon and his sisters first set foot on Westerosi soil. No doubt author George Martin has an outstanding ability in fantasy world-building that draws his readers in. For the three days I spent reading the book, I forgot the outside world existed. THE ANTHROPOCENE REVIEWEDJohn Green
Penguin Random House (2021)The Anthropocene Reviewed is the latest book by John Green. This essay collection grapples with the world that the humans have inhabited for all these years, but within the context of the early days of the pandemic. That is why reading it feels like a historical document that is also very recent. Each one of the essays takes an idea from everyday life, from culture, from society, and pulls it apart and creates a venue to discuss wider social issues. John Green has a great gift for tackling complex thoughts and ideas through everyday metaphors that we can all understand.Every one of these books took me on a compelling journey, and made me question the seemingly monotonous aspects of life. Beginning to read after so long, it has allowed me to be a part of something bigger than myself. Through reading them, I rediscovered the sense of purpose that I had lost when SSC ended.Isra Kabir is a contributor to Daily Star Books. "
/news/bangladesh/politics/news/bnps-khulna-rally-owners-take-buses-streets-3148081,BNP’s Khulna rally: Owners take buses off the streets,"Bus owners are suspending bus services in Khulna for two days from today ahead of the BNP's protest rally in the city tomorrow.Transport owners' association leaders told The Daily Star that local Awami League leaders put pressure on them to keep buses off the roads to prevent BNP men from taking part in the rally.The ruling party leaders, however, denied involvement.Authorities of several hotels in Khulna city alleged that they were being pressurised by AL leaders not to allow in any new guests ahead of the rally. Police were also asking them not to receive any guests from outside Khulna.Speaking to this newspaper wishing not to be named, a top leader of Khulna District Bus, Minibus, Coach and Microbus Owners' Association said, ""The association did not take the decision on its own. Local Awami League leaders forced us to make the decision.""Khulna Motor Sramik Union just followed the bus owners' decision.""As the bus owners decided not to operate buses for two days, we have no other option but to follow the decision,"" said Zakir Hossain Biplob, general secretary of the labour union.The two organisations on Tuesday night jointly decided that no buses would operate on 18 routes from Sonadanga Bus Terminal in the city for those two days if the locally-made three-wheelers were not taken off roads by October 20.The BNP will organise the rally at Khulna city's Sonali Bank intersection tomorrow protesting price hike of essentials and fuel, recent killings of five party men in police firing in Bhola, Narayanganj, Munshiganj and Jashore, and also demanding ""release"" of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia.Md Mizanur Rahman, president of Khulna District Bus, Minibus, Coach, Microbus Owners Association and also a former AL MP from Khulna-2, yesterday said the decision to enforce the bus strike was made without consulting him as he was away.Asked whether they put pressure on bus owners to enforce the strike, he told The Daily Star that their programme had nothing to do with the BNP's rally.'PRESSURE ON HOTELIERS'Authorities of several hotels in Khulna city yesterday alleged that they were verbally instructed by local AL leaders not to take in any new guests from outside Khulna.""We are not receiving any new guest as renovation work is underway at the hotel,"" said a receptionist at Hotel Royal.However, this correspondent found that a small renovation work was going on and the hotel didn't suspend its operations.Masudur Rahman Bhuiyan, police commissioner of Khulna Metropolitan Police, said they did not issue any directives to the hotel owners regarding receiving new guests.He said they check names and addresses of hotel guests as part of their routine work to make sure that no criminal hides there.Amid such a situation, local BNP leaders have asked the party leaders and activists from the 10 districts in Khulna division to reach the divisional city by today and stay in homes of their relatives.""As bus services will remain suspended, we have asked the party men to travel to Khulna by trucks, pickups, microbuses and cars,"" said Mizanur Rahman, member of the convening committee of Khulna Metropolitan BNP.He said the party men have also been advised to use river routes to join the rally. They have also been asked to travel to the venue in groups to avoid any possible harassment by police.Shamsuzzaman Dudu, coordinator of the rally and also a vice chairman of the BNP, said they would hold the rally on time no matter what the situation might be.Speaking at a press conference at the BNP office in the city, he alleged that police were raiding the houses of the party leaders and activists.Responding to a query, the BNP leader said the party men were instructed not to carry any sticks.Many senior BNP leaders, who were relieved from party posts earlier, have started working for the rally.Speaking at a press conference at Khulna Press Club yesterday, former Khulna City BNP president Nazrul Islam Manju, who was relieved from the post, said, ""The party has called for making the rally a success and we all are working ignoring all differences and divisions.""RECRUITMENT TESTA recruitment test of the Department of Social Services is scheduled for today. Many candidates are uncertain about making it to the exam because of the bus strike.About 13,376 candidates from Khulna are seeking the post of Grade III social worker.Khan Motahar Hossain, deputy director of Khulna District Social Service Office, said the announcement for the recruitment test was made much earlier.""Nothing can be done at this stage if bus services remain suspended in Khulna. I would advise the candidates to come to the city at least a day before the exam,"" he said."
/business/economy/news/forex-reserves-below-36b-3148366,Forex reserves below $36b,"Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves dipped below $36 billion on Wednesday due to increased import payments compared to slower-than-expected export earnings.The reserves stood at $35.98 billion, down from $36.11 billion a day ago, according to data from Bangladesh Bank.The country's reserves stood at $46.19 billion on October 19 last year.The reserves have been decreasing even though Bangladesh Bank has been repeatedly injecting US dollars into the market for the last couple of months to help businesses clear their import bills.The central bank has so far injected more than $4.57 billion into the market this fiscal year after supplying a record $7.62 billion in the last fiscal year.Imports surged to $12.7 billion in the first two months of this fiscal year, up 17 per cent from a year prior.Meanwhile, exports grew 24 per cent to $8.13 billion and remittance flow rose 12.25 per cent to $4.13 billion.A high official of a commercial bank said remittances have declined in recent periods, putting extra pressure on the reserves.The taka has been rendered one of the worst-performing currencies in South Asia in the last one year because of the country's plummeting foreign exchange reserves.The exchange rate of the taka stood at Tk 105 per dollar on October 19, down 22.6 per cent from a year ago.Only two other currencies – the Sri Lankan rupee and Pakistani rupee – performed worse than the taka during the period. The Sri Lankan rupee fell by 79.3 per cent while the Pakistani rupee was down 27.7 per cent, showed central bank data.The depreciation of the taka has already reduced the number of letters of credit (LCs) being opened, which will have a positive impact in curbing the depletion of foreign exchange reserves in the coming days.The number of LCs opened amounted to $12.4 billion in the first two months of the ongoing fiscal year in contrast to $12.3 billion in fiscal 2021-22.At a press briefing yesterday, the Centre for Policy Dialogue said the central bank should prevent the forex reserve from falling further, ""particularly in view of the recent debate regarding the estimation methodology and pursue a floating exchange rate policy""."

/opinion/editorial/news/acute-gas-crisis-hurting-everyone-3148576,Acute gas crisis is hurting everyone,"There is an element of irony in the public assessment of the ongoing gas crisis – that it has reached a ""boiling point,"" given that we have hardly enough gas to burn or boil. The crisis, as per a report by this newspaper, has been affecting domestic and commercial consumers equally. And despite assurances to the contrary, it's evident that a drastic improvement in the situation is unlikely to happen anytime soon. This means people will have to go on to make painful compromises indefinitely. The crisis has been attributed to a considerable shortfall in gas supply – claimed to be 10 percent – caused by the government's decision to stop purchasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the international spot market in July. Its effect has been felt across the board: while households had to grapple with arbitrary and unscheduled gas rationing – unlike the more predictable load-shedding – the same in industries requiring gas to run their boilers and burners saw a significant fall in production. According to the Bangladesh Ceramic Manufacturers & Exporters Association, the ceramic industry alone has seen a 10 to 30 percent drop in production due to the ongoing crisis. Industry insiders say this has hurt their business prospects, including cancellation of orders from foreign buyers. Clearly, the government is at a critical juncture, unable to affect the outcome of global events pushing up gas prices. But at the same time, and rather inexplicably, it is unwilling to adapt itself to better cushion external shocks. 
At the CNG filling stations, there has been a five-hour daily shutdown along with insufficient gas pressure during active hours, an affliction shared by households and industries as well. To top it all off, the power sector, which consumes 42 percent of the total gas supply, had to reduce electricity generation at around 30 gas-fired plants, leading to over six hours of load-shedding a day. These problems, interlinked and mutually exacerbating as they are, have only compounded suffering. The extent of suffering becomes clear from the remark of Jummatul Bida, a resident in Dhaka's Gandaria area, who told this newspaper, ""For the last two months, we haven't got any gas from 8am till 7pm… If I can't get up very early in the morning, we either have to starve or buy food from restaurants.""

Clearly, the government is at a critical juncture, unable to affect the outcome of global events pushing up gas prices. But at the same time, and rather inexplicably, it is unwilling to adapt itself to better cushion external shocks. These external shocks, in the form of price volatility and supply disruptions in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war, would have been more manageable, had the government diversified its sources of energy or, better yet, not been so heavily reliant on gas imports.
The government has long rubbished calls for further exploring and extracting our own gas reserves. It has allowed a quick-fix mentality and collusive deals to compromise our energy security. This cannot happen any longer. We urge the government to take urgent steps to mitigate people's suffering. The acute gas and electricity crises must have an expiration date. The authorities should immediately engage with experts to find durable and long-term solutions to these problems.

/news/bangladesh/news/it-was-eyewash-3148286,"Stakeholders’ consultation mostly ignored in final draft of social media, OTT regulation","Even though Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) had invited feedback on the draft of its new social media regulation, the finalised version shows that little or no heed was paid to the major stakeholders.Last Wednesday, BTRC gave the High Court the meeting minutes of the last three sessions held by the Regulation Formation Committee when finalising the draft of the regulation. The minutes portray that crucial feedback given by stakeholders was not even discussed, let alone adopted.The finalised ""BTRC Regulation for Digital, Social Media and OTT Platforms"" was submitted to the High Court on the same day.The final draft allows the government to order individuals to take down content, empowers it to order social media companies to block content, and grants it indemnity for its actions under the law.Over the months, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), Bangladesh Legal Aid Services Trust (BLAST), Global Network Initiatives and others sent feedback ringing alarm bells about the government constricting the space for free expression.BLAST, in its recommendations, had told BTRC that ""imposing restrictions on the creation and dissemination of online content will create a chilling effect on freedom of expression concerning issues of rights and justice, including by and about marginalised communities, and will inhibit democratic debate and discourse.""""The grounds on which social media intermediaries are required to take down content are similar to certain Digital Security Act provisions that have already been identified by commentators as arbitrarily restricting freedom of speech and expression,"" read the recommendations by BLAST.The grounds on which social media intermediaries are required to take down content are similar to certain Digital Security Act provisions that have already been identified by commentators as arbitrarily restricting freedom of speech and expression.

This includes content that threatens the ""unity, integrity, defence, security, or sovereignty of Bangladesh, [and its] friendly relations with foreign states"" or ""is against the Liberation War of Bangladesh, the spirit of the Liberation War, the Father of the Nation, the national anthem, or the national flag"", ""threatens the secrecy of the government"" or ""creates unrest or disorder or deteriorates the law and order situation"" or ""threatens public order"".
TIB had pointed out that requiring all social media intermediaries, tech companies, internet service providers, OTT platforms and online news publishers to get locally registered, and empowering BTRC to cancel the registration if their activities go against the regulation will put them in a bodysuit.
It said it puts foreign companies at risk of surveillance and disincentivises them from operating in Bangladesh.
These concerns -- among many others -- were not addressed and the finalised draft still retains these provisions.
The BTRC submission to the HC reads, ""It was agreed that the Regulation shall be finalised after necessary consideration and/or evaluation of the feedback/input from several concerned stakeholders in this regard.""
Yet this commitment to evaluate feedback from stakeholders is not reflected in the meeting minutes.
During the eleventh session, held on September 4, the committee reviewed the definitions of terms like ""content"", ""digital device"", ""intermediary"" and ""curated content"".
Two weeks later, on September 18, the committee met again for their twelfth session. They discussed and decided that companies that are already registered, do not need to register again. However, it did not speak of doing away with the requirement.
During this meeting, they decided to adopt one feedback made by Global Network Initiatives (GNI), a collective whose members include Meta, Microsoft, Uber, Zoom, Telenor Group, Yahoo, Google, Nokia, Vodafone, Verizon, Human Rights Watch, Wikimedia, Committee to Protect Journalists and others.
GNI had expressed alarm at the fact that the draft regulation features excessive penalties for violations, including fines of up to Tk 3 billion and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years and targets company personnel.
During the 12th meeting, the committee decided to scrap criminal liability, and include corporate liability instead. The latest draft kept intact provisions for fines if the regulations were violated but removed the ceilings that were mentioned in the previous drafts. Instead, it just added that the ""fine should not be excessive"".
In addition, during the 12th meeting, the committee dropped the section in the previous draft that forced companies to circumvent end-to-end encryption and identify ""first originators"" of any content or message sent.
Ten days later, the committee met for the 13th time, and finalised the draft, leaving key concerns up in the air.
Ashish Kumar Kundu, the director-general (legal and licensing division), who signed the meeting minutes, told this newspaper that many stakeholders were consulted and met with before this draft was finalised.

""I think it was the best team performance this season.""You have seen today we are developing. You see how we want to play, we get better on the pitch every time. Spurs are a magnificent team so far this season, I said to the lads in the dressing room it was enjoyable to watch you.""It was a squad performance. What we have seen today, we have 11 players who defend and 11 who attack. I am pleased with that. I will not say that I am totally satisfied. That has to be the standard at Manchester United.""There was one negative for Ten Hag as unused substitute Cristiano Ronaldo walked down the tunnel before the final whistle, seemingly unhappy at not being involved once again this season.The United boss, however, did not want the incident to detract from their display.""I don't pay attention today, we will deal with that tomorrow,"" he added. ""I want to focus on this team, on these 11 players.""Against this Tottenham, you need good pressing, good counter-pressing, from there you can create chances. So you need good pressing players. Offensive wise you need that dynamic. That is what Marcus (Rashford) brings."""
/news/world/uk/news/liz-truss-downing-streets-briefest-incumbent-3148421,Liz Truss: Downing Street’s briefest incumbent,"Liz Truss is set to become the shortest-serving prime minister in Britain's history, after the public, MPs and the markets comprehensively rejected the self-styled heir to Margaret Thatcher.Truss succeeded Boris Johnson by selling to the Conservative rank-and-file a plan to turbo-charge economic growth through tax cuts, via increased borrowing.She accused her rival in this summer's Tory leadership race, Rishi Sunak, of ""scaremongering"" when he warned that such an approach at a time of rampant inflation would drive up interest rates for millions of Britons.But that is exactly what happened.Yesterday, Truss was forced to announce her own resignation, a week after firing her finance minister and ""ideological soulmate"", Kwasi Kwarteng, in a desperate bid to shore up her position.The Tories expect to have a new leader in place by October 28, meaning Truss will comfortably underperform 19th-century leader George Canning, who died in office after serving for 118 days.She is no stranger to screeching U-turns, having begun her political journey as the Liberal Democrat-supporting daughter of progressive parents. At that time, she also opposed the monarchy and Brexit.Her youthful calls to abolish the royal family ran headlong into her new role when Queen Elizabeth II died on September 8, only two days after appointing Truss.The new prime minister paid tribute to the late monarch, curtsied to King Charles III, and joined the queen's successor on a tour of his new UK realms.But her tribute from the steps of 10 Downing Street was widely seen as stilted, betraying the leaden oratory of Truss in comparison to the verbal theatrics of Johnson.Yet after scandal-ridden Johnson, Truss's unvarnished style and promises of a right-wing agenda found favour with the Tory membership.Johnson's former top aide Dominic Cummings likened her to a ""human hand grenade"", and some MPs accused her of excessive self-promotion.Truss grew up first in Scotland and then in an affluent suburb of Leeds, northern England.Her mother was a nurse, teacher and campaigner for nuclear disarmament who took her on protests, and her father was a left-wing maths professor.She went on to Oxford, where she graduated in philosophy, politics and economics.At Oxford, she was president of the university's Liberal Democrat branch. At the party's national conference in 1994, she gave a speech calling for the abolition of the monarchy.By her own admission, her switch to the Conservatives shocked her parents, but she says her beliefs had evolved.After university, Truss worked in the energy sector, including for Shell, and telecommunications before entering politics a decade later.She was a local councillor in southeast London for four years and became an MP in 2010."

/law-our-rights/news/what-do-if-you-have-been-sacked-while-maternity-leave-3148321,What to do if you have been sacked while on maternity leave,"A few months ago, Mita (not her real name), a pregnant garments worker, while giving an interview to a well-known newspaper, mentioned that she was sacked by her production manager when she was on her authorised maternity leave. According to her, the basis for her termination was a refusal to provide maternity benefits. This is merely one of many stories. If a pregnant employee is terminated owing to her pregnancy, this constitutes discrimination and unjust termination. Before delving into how pregnant workers can assert unfair dismissal, let us briefly review the pertinent legal provisions covering maternity leave and termination procedures in Bangladesh.Chapter IV of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006 addresses the issue of maternity leave. According to section 46 of the Act, women are eligible for a maximum of 16 weeks of maternity leave. They are required to receive the benefit eight weeks before and eight weeks after giving birth. Section 47 outlines the procedure for taking a leave of absence. It stipulates that any pregnant woman qualified for maternity leave may verbally or non-verbally inform her employer that she expects to be hospitalised within eight weeks. Within seven days of giving birth to a child, a mother who has not provided equivalent notification must disclose vital information to her employer. After obtaining the notification, the employer must grant the woman worker a leave commencing the day after the date of the notification. By interpreting these sections, it is evident that if the law requires an employer to give maternity leave, and the employee is terminated during the permitted leave, this constitutes an unjust termination.Then follows the clause about termination. Often, pregnant employees are terminated without explanation or notification. This termination is referred to as simpliciter termination under section 26. As per this section, the employer has unrestricted authority to terminate the employee. However, before terminating a worker's employment, the employer must provide a notice of 120 days in advance for month-rated permanent workers and 60 days in advance for other workers. For temporary workers, notice must be given within 60 days if the worker is paid every month and 14 days for other workers. This section also provides power to the employer to dismiss an employee without warning; nevertheless, he must pay salary for each completed year of service or gratuity, whichever is more, along with any other benefits to which the employee may be entitled the terms of the 2006 Act.Now let us return to the underlying issue of how a pregnant employee on maternity leave might claim unjust termination. In this context, section 33 of the Act can shield pregnant employees as the method outlined in this section, known as the grievance procedure, is applicable in the case of termination simpliciter. The whole procedure is outlined below:A written complaint to the employerAccording to this clause, any worker, including a pregnant woman who has a grievance over termination and aims to seek remedy must report their grievance to their employer in writing and by registered post within thirty days after learning the reason for their resentment.An investigation by the employer, hearing of the  pregnant woman and decision of the employerWithin thirty days of receiving a complaint, the employer must investigate, provide the employee with an opportunity to be heard, and convey the decision in writing to the employee.Submission of the written complaint to the Labour CourtIf the employer fails to offer a decision or if the worker is unsatisfied with the course of action, the pregnant worker has thirty days from the date of the decision to file a written complaint with the Labour Court.Notifying both parties and hearing before the courtUpon being notified of the complaint, the Labour Court will hear the parties after providing them with notice and issue any orders it deems reasonable and necessary.Remedies provided by the courtThe Labour Court may, among other remedies, order the complainant's return to service, with or without back pay.Appeal to the TribunalIf the pregnant worker feels aggrieved by an order issued by the Labour Court, she will have the opportunity to appeal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal within thirty days after the order, and the tribunal's judgment will be final.Compensation under section 286Apart from that, regarding compensation, section 286 of the Act stipulates that any employer who violates any condition of Chapter IV is subject to a fine of up to 25,000 taka. Furthermore, while giving a penalty under this section, the court may provide an order to pay all or a portion of the fine to compensate the woman for any loss or harm resulting from the violation.To conclude, maternity leave is a necessary precondition for working women. However, the unfair termination of a pregnant worker during maternity leave is becoming a growing concern among women in the workforce. Hence it is crucial to enforce the labour laws and keep an eye out for any signs of unjust actions by the employer. The writer is a Student of Law, Bangladesh University of Professionals."

/tech-startup/news/how-set-budget-greenscreen-home-3148266,How to set up a budget greenscreen at home,"A greenscreen is an indispensable tool in filmmaking. It is a simple technique that has been around for about 100 years, and in plain words, it only means layering one image on top of another. The process of using a green screen involves removing a single colour from a shot—often green or blue—leaving the subject on a transparent background that can then be blended with any other background. From fun TikTok videos to quick homemade short films—the uses of a greenscreen can be endless if you are looking to tinker with some rudimentary VFX. The good news is, you can create your own greenscreen by just using fabric from a craft store. Here's what to keep in mind:Any surface that contrasts with your subject and is a single, flat colour can be used. Brown ""sandscreens"", for instance, were used in making Dune. Although human skin tones contrast well against green and blue screens, any solid colour can be used in their place (depending on your shot).Getting that solid colour, though, can be trickier. The shot may be messed up by clothing wrinkles and poor lighting. This is a problem if you have painted walls in your house, which frequently have textures or can reflect light in some areas. As a result, more than just the colour is what you should look for in a greenscreen. You can get away with using a pop-up backdrop if you only need to shoot one subject that is standing still. You will need a larger screen for scenes involving more people or in larger settings. Remember that in order to prevent casting shadows, you must maintain a minimal distance between your subject and the screen.There are other options besides fabric, which is how most greenscreens are made. Options made of foam or spandex will resist wrinkles better than some fabrics. You can also paint rigid backdrops like cardboard or wood with a little effort. If you intend to shoot on location or somewhere else where the screen won't be against a wall, you might also want to use thick material to stop light from leaking through the back.Even lighting across the surface is crucial. Meaning, all parts of the screen should be equally lit). But if your greenscreen is overly reflective, it may be challenging to achieve. Any bright spots on your screen will become an issue later. This is especially noticeable on glossy surfaces like painted walls. Get materials with a more matte surface to make your lighting job easier.There are no such things as too many stands. They come in handy for hanging fabric screens and setting up lights, among other things. You can keep a variety of stands around the house as well. The best ones to choose will depend on the weight of the equipment you're using, the available space, and your financial situation.A few of the most popular (and affordable) options are tripod stands for cameras. These can be used to mount lights, clamps, or hold up backdrops because they have 1/4-inch screw tips. However, it is better to spend a little more money on a tripod that is more durable for your camera.Backdrop stands are more beneficial for larger screens. The photography stands are very similar to these, but they come in pairs, have longer screw tips, and have a telescoping crossbar from which fabric screens can be hung. Although they're still not very stable, these ought to work as long as you don't force your subject into the screen.C-stands are an option that is more robust. You might only need one for your heaviest equipment if you're trying to stay within your spending limit. These stands are stabilised by three independent legs, each of which can rotate up to 120 degrees. Furthermore, they are strong enough to support a telescoping arm by themselves. For supporting the large lights that you need to illuminate your green screen, these can be incredibly helpful.There are countless ways to light your subject and your screen. Your objectives will remain the same regardless of the type of lighting you use: light your screen evenly, prevent creating any shadows, and light it as independently of your subject as you can.This can be difficult, but you usually need at least a couple of big, bright light sources. Smaller lights will produce hot spots on the screen where the areas closest to the light will be much brighter than the areas farther away. This is especially true when the lights are placed close to the screen. Get some large lights or diffuse some smaller ones to solve this.Softbox photography lights come in handy in this situation. Softboxes reduce harsh shadows by spreading the light more evenly. It's convenient to have, and it's also helpful to light your greenscreen so that the key is more consistently applied to your subject. Softboxes have their own grids, which is the best part. Instead of spreading light outward, grids allow you to focus it in a specific area. When you want to light your subject and your green screen independently, this can be incredibly useful.You can also consider LED panels. These are becoming more and more common because many of them let you change the colour temperature (or even the RGB colour) of the light, which can be useful and prevent you from having to do additional post-production work. But they can be fairly expensive.The free video editor DaVinci Resolve has numerous chroma key tools built right in—but they still are not quite as good enough. Watch out for a detailed guide on video editing software in the next issue. For now, setting up and lighting your greenscreen correctly the first time is the best way to save time and effort while ensuring that your shots look their best."
/law-our-rights/news/some-reflections-the-icjs-judgment-preliminary-objections-the-gambia-v-myanmar-3148396,Some Reflections on the ICJ’s judgment on preliminary objections in The Gambia v Myanmar,"Law Desk (LD): What was your immediate reaction when you first read the ICJ's judgment on preliminary objections in The Gambia v Myanmar?Kawser Ahmed (KA): The preliminary objections judgment in The Gambia v Myanmar was not entirely unexpected in the sense that Myanmar already raised those questions before the ICJ during the provisional measures hearing. The Court also addressed those questions, albeit briefly in its order. It appears that Myanmar in one way or another reiterated the same arguments that it made during the provisional measures hearing at the preliminary objections stage. A careful reading of the preliminary objections judgment also suggests that the Court followed the same line of reasoning as it did in the provisional measures order.LD: How would you compare the Court's judgment on preliminary objections with the provisional measures order?KA: Before the ICJ indicates provisional measures, it always checks if it has prima facie jurisdiction to deal with the case. Only if the Court is satisfied that it has prima facie jurisdiction, it may consider issuing the provisional measures order.During the provisional measures hearing, Myanmar based its jurisdictional objections on two grounds, namely, the non-existence of any dispute and its reservation to article VIII of the Genocide Convention. Notably, Myanmar's argument that The Gambia acted as a proxy on behalf of the OIC was presented in connection with the non-existence of a dispute. On top of that, Myanmar made an additional argument that The Gambia did not have locus standi to bring a case before the ICJ as it was not directly affected by the alleged genocidal acts of Myanmar against the Rohingyas.At the preliminary objections stage, the Court treated the aforesaid proxy argument as a separate preliminary objection. As a result, the total number of Myanmar's preliminary objections rose to four.I have already pointed out that the Court followed the same line of reasoning in the preliminary objections judgment as it did in the provisional measures order. Moreover, the ICJ has dealt with Myanmar's preliminary objections more elaborately in the judgment. For example, the Court, in the provisional measures order, mainly relied on the meaning of the expression 'call upon' in article VIII of the Genocide Convention to reject Myanmar's argument that The Gambia could not seise the Court because of its reservation to the aforesaid article. Now, in the preliminary objections judgment, the ICJ has provided additional reasoning based on the expression, 'competent organs of the United Nations' to hold that the meaning of this expression does not include the Court itself.It should be mentioned that the ICJ's judgment on preliminary objections, as opposed to its provisional measures order, has the effect of res judicata.LD: Would you please clarify the difference between a jurisdictional objection and an objection to the admissibility of the application?KA: The jurisdiction of the ICJ comes from the consent of the litigant states. The distinction between a jurisdictional objection and an objection to the admissibility of the application is that while the former denotes a lack of consent of the party, the latter signifies that there are reasons for the ICJ not to proceed with a case even if it has jurisdiction.In the case of jurisdiction, the ICJ examines if the litigant state parties have given consent to settlement of a dispute by the Court. On the other hand, a preliminary objection to the admissibility of the application informs of the existence of a compelling legal reason as to why the Court should decline to hear a case even when it has jurisdiction [Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v Serbia)].It may be noticed that the Court dealt with jurisdictional objections first in this case, and when it was satisfied that it had jurisdiction, it then proceeded to address the objections to the admissibility of the application.LD: What do you make of the ICJ's reasoning in the preliminary objections judgment?KA: On the whole, the Court has maintained a consistent and predictable approach in dealing with Myanmar's preliminary objections. However, I think the Court should have elaborated on a few points connected with the first and second preliminary objections.For example, let's take Myanmar's first preliminary objection that The Gambia was not a real applicant and brought the case as a proxy of the OIC. While addressing this objection, the Court should have independently assessed whether there existed any dispute between the OIC and Myanmar regarding the interpretation and application of the Genocide Convention. Because Myanmar's objection only makes sense in the backdrop of such a dispute which The Gambia reportedly has taken over from the OIC. Besides, if there exists any such dispute between the OIC and Myanmar, the Court for the soundness of its decision should discuss the legal implication thereof, although it may be argued that the Court need not go this far to determine the question of jurisdiction – what matters most is the existence of a dispute between The Gambia and Myanmar. Given this context, such an exercise, if were undertaken by the ICJ, might have allowed it to consider whether the first preliminary objection of Myanmar was of exclusively preliminary character. If yes, the Court then, instead of dismissing this preliminary objection, could decide to deal with it at length later at the merits stage.As regards the second preliminary objection, Myanmar submitted that The Gambia's Application is not admissible for lack of standing before the ICJ. In short, Myanmar argued that the right to invoke state responsibility under general international law and the issue of standing before the Court are not synonymous per se. As a result, a non-injured state party to the Genocide Convention (The Gambia) may have the right to invoke another state party's responsibility (Myanmar) for violations of the Convention, but this would not necessarily entitle the non-injured state to bring a claim before the Court. In Myanmar's view, only the states which are specially affected by an internationally wrongful act have standing before the Court. (¶ 94)In response to Myanmar's submission, the ICJ opined that the responsibility for an alleged breach of obligations erga omnes partes under the Genocide Convention may be invoked through the institution of proceedings before the Court even in the absence of any special interest or injury suffered, otherwise in many situations no State would be in a position to make a claim. Relying on its judgment in the Case concerning Questions Relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v Senegal), the Court held that Myanmar's purported distinction between the entitlement to invoke responsibility under the Genocide Convention and standing to pursue a claim for this purpose before the Court has no basis in law. (¶ 108)In Belgium v Senegal, the Court held that a state may invoke the responsibility of another state for the latter's failure to comply with its obligations erga omnes partes and make claims concerning the cessation of the alleged breach (¶ 69). On this basis, the Court concluded that Belgium had standing to invoke the responsibility of Senegal for the alleged breaches of its obligations under the Convention against Torture (¶ 70). Hence, it appears that the Court in Belgium v Senegal took a conceptual leap overlooking the distinction among the invocation of state responsibility, claiming cessation of and reparation for the internationally wrongful act, and standing before the Court. Interestingly, the Court did not explicitly refer to article 48 of the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) in its judgment, although it borrowed therefrom some of the aforesaid expressions. A careful reading of paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 48 of ARSIWA reveals that these expressions entail different meanings and stages of the course of action. The ICJ in its judgment on the preliminary objections in The Gambia v Myanmar could have engaged with the conceptual nitty-gritty and bridged the gap.The preliminary objections judgment in The Gambia v Myanmar gives an impression that the Court adopted a minimalist approach in analysing the legal and factual issues concerning the preliminary objections of Myanmar.LD: In your opinion, how would the judgment on the preliminary objections in The Gambia v Myanmar influence the jurisprudence of the ICJ?KA: Compared to the preliminary objections that were raised in the previous genocide cases i.e., Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia v Serbia, Myanmar's preliminary objections in The Gambia v Myanmar are quite different in the sense that the sustainability of these preliminary objections has not been tested earlier before the ICJ in relation to disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the Genocide Convention. Therefore, the Court's reasoning in this preliminary objections judgment will bear significance for many of the future cases before the ICJ.For example, the proxy argument of Myanmar in the first preliminary objection is the first of its kind. If the facts of a case ever happen to allow a litigant state to raise the proxy argument as a preliminary objection in the future, the Court as well as the counsels will surely consult the preliminary objections judgment rendered in The Gambia v Myanmar. Also, the Court's interpretation of article VIII of the Genocide Convention, in particular, the reasoning that reservation to article VIII does not bar a state from seising the Court is worthy of note. One cannot but notice that the judgment sheds new light on the requirements for establishing the existence of a dispute (degree of particularity and mutual awareness) and the locus standi of non-injured states.However, we have to bear in mind that any decision of the ICJ has no binding force except for the parties to a case only.LD: Will Bangladesh's reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention constitute a bar if it decides to intervene in the case in future?KA: In Legality of Use of Force (Yugoslavia v United States of America), the ICJ noted that the Genocide Convention did not prohibit reservations and accordingly, the USA's reservation to article IX thereof had the effect of excluding the application of this provision between the USA and Yugoslavia. The Court concluded that article IX did not constitute even a prima facie basis of jurisdiction in this case. Ultimately, the Court dismissed Yugoslavia's application in limine litis.At the time of acceding to the Genocide Convention on 05 October 1998, Bangladesh made a declaration on article IX- which sounds similar to the aforementioned reservation of the USA. Objectively speaking, Bangladesh's declaration is a reservation indeed. However, Bangladesh's reservation to article IX should not be an obstacle in case it wishes to intervene as a 'non-party' in The Gambia v Myanmar provided that conditions of articles 62 or 63 of the Statute of the ICJ are satisfied as the case may be.LD: Thank you.KA: You are welcome."

However, it must be kept in mind that the health ministry can only provide treatment, not kill Aedes mosquitoes. Zahid Maleque, Health minister
Dengue has still not loosened its grip on the country, as infections keep piling up. Cases this year reached 28,698 yesterday, the second highest since 2000, when the country witnessed the first-ever outbreak. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
According to Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), at least four dengue patients died, while 896 were hospitalised across the country in 24 hours till yesterday morning.
 








Experts fear the situation will persist throughout this month, but cases may start decreasing from the beginning or middle of November.



According to DGHS data, of the total 28,698 cases, 12,606 were recorded in just 20 days of October, while 55 out of the 110 deaths were witnessed during the same period.
A total of 1,01,354 people, the highest ever, were hospitalised and 179 died in 2019.
When the first outbreak occurred in 2000, 93 died and 5,551 were infected.



Entomologist Manzur A Chowdhury said the government will have to conduct a massive campaign to destroy Aedes-mosquito breeding grounds and kill adult mosquitoes.
""Everyone will have to spray insecticide in their homes twice a day. Every citizen of the country, not only residents of Dhaka, will have to remain cautious, so that mosquitoes don't bite them,"" Manzur said.
Rainfall is still being witnessed, so daily dengue infections may not decline till mid-November, he said.
Entomologist Kabirul Bashar said it is essential to conduct crash programmes to control Aedes mosquitoes across the country.
Using mosquito nets is crucial, no matter whether it is day or night, he said, adding that children will have to wear full-sleeved clothes.
Meanwhile, Health Minister Zahid Maleque yesterday said the authorities are sufficiently prepared to provide dengue treatment if cases increase further.
""We have readied Dhaka North City Corporation Hospital, the new wing of BSMMU and Lalkuthi hospital,"" he said  at a programme at Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute.
However, it must be kept in mind that the health ministry can only provide treatment, not kill Aedes mosquitoes, the minister said.
Stressing the need for city corporations and municipalities to kill mosquitoes, Maleque said dengue patients will go down when the Aedes-mosquito population goes down.
At a programme in Dhaka yesterday, Nazmul Islam, director of DGHS' disease control wing, said they are expecting dengue cases to decrease from early next month.
He said many factors are behind the high dengue cases. ""This year, the monsoon came late. There has been intermittent rain, barely any torrential rain, then regular rain due to low pressure. These issues have played a very important role.""
""We believe no one person can deal with all the impacts of climate change; everyone in the country has to deal with it together… Each citizen has a responsibility to keep the city clean. If we are aware, then of course, breeding areas of mosquitoes will go down, and so will their population,"" added Nazmul.
Dhaka North City Corporation started a seven-day, anti-mosquito crash programme on Wednesday, which will continue till Tuesday.
Dhaka South City Corporation also started an initiative in five vulnerable wards -- 6, 2, 3, 56 and 15 -- on October 16, which continued till yesterday.
""We are also taking special measures besides the routine work, which include drives around houses of dengue patients,"" said Md Abu Nasher, public relations officer of DSCC.

Once the bridge is opened to traffic, it will connect Baufal, Galachipa and Dashmina upazilas with the district headquarters, locals said.Private firm China Harzone Industry Corporation Limited got the work order to construct the steel structure, with a cost of Tk 21.17 crore.Dashmina's Betagi-Sankipur Union Parishad Chairman Moshiur Rahman Jhantu said in the absence of a bridge, thousands of people of nearby areas have to go to the district town by crossing the Lohalia on boats. "

Both sides of the footpath on the Patgodam road in Mymensingh have been occupied by vendors, mostly selling old tyres and similar products. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Locals said the business has created a public nuisance, as they cannot use the walkway anymore.
Not just this one, many of the city's footpaths remain occupied by vendors as they continue to run their businesses there in full swing.



Ahmed Ali, a city dweller, said the place is near the busy Shambhuganj Bridge, which is an entrance to the city's important areas.
He said there is always heavy traffic on both sides of the bridge. ""Previously, we used to get off our vehicles and walk to our destinations whenever there were gridlocks. But we cannot even walk peacefully as the footpaths are occupied,"" he lamented.
Echoing the same, local Shukur Chand said there are often altercations between pedestrians and vendors over the matter.



The encroachers are mostly backed up by politically influential people, claimed Abdul Hye, a restaurant worker.
Advocate Nazrul Islam Chunnu, convener of Jonouddhogh Mymensingh, a citizens' forum, shared the same sentiments.
""A sustainable plan should be taken to evict such illegal businesses from the city footpaths,"" he added.
Nurul Amin Kalam, secretary of Mymensingh Nagorik Andolon, said Surja Kanta Hospital (SK Hospital), the only diarrhoea hospital in Mymensingh, is near the place.

/opinion/views/blowin-the-wind/news/walking-the-city-3148596,Walking in the city,"Sunil Gangopadhyay once authored a poem urging the then Indian premier Indira Gandhi not to visit a flood-affected Gujarat on a plane, giving a surprising excuse. He thought that seeing the image of the overturned sky reflected on the floodwater that devoured everything except for a few surviving rooftops and tall trees, Gandhi might be filled with a gush of appreciation and exclaim, ""How beautiful!"" October 23 marks the 10th death anniversary of Gangopadhyay, one of the most celebrated Bangalee writers. Great writers have the gift of transcending their time and space. They invite us to join a realm of imagination where national and historic boundaries become immaterial. The limit of their language becomes a springboard to venture limitless possibilities. Revisiting the poem ""To Indira Gandhi"" ahead of his death anniversary reminded me of the danger of looking at reality from a safe distance. In a world where optics provided by drones are encompassing our imagination, we often learn to detach ourselves from the ground reality and find satisfaction in having a broader view of things. ""To Indira Gandhi"" made me think of a fascinating essay by French philosopher Michel de Certeau. In ""Walking in the City,"" included in his 1980 collection The Practice of Everyday Life, de Certeau contrasts his experience of seeing the city of New York from the height of the World Trade Center and walking through the city. For him, those who have the view from the top assume a power position to control what is below. In contrast, the pedestrians make their own rules in scripting their escape from the city's regulatory schemes. On Thursday, when a middle-aged woman jaywalked across Airport Road near Banani and was saved only by the auto-brake of my car, I thought of the efficacy of de Certeau's subversive proposition. For de Certeau, a pedestrian makes new meanings of the paces by redefining their assigned purpose. The one who stands in the middle of the road to hurry the bus to the spot, the one yelling at someone on their phone, the one sipping from a green coconut while standing in the middle of the footpath, the one stopping you to ask for charity, the dog taking a day nap on a footpath, the graffiti on the wall, the ads on the lampposts, the litters, the missing manhole lids, the hawkers – they all form a lived narrative that can only be reduced as a view when seen from the above. The stories come alive when you walk in the city and meet the faces that form the mass. I thought of the middle-aged burqa-clad woman who nearly had an accident with my car. I tried to imagine her story. From the comfort of my car, am I in a position to judge her recklessness, confusion or desperation to cross the street in a city that shows no mercy to pedestrians? The negligence shown towards pedestrians in Dhaka is evident even at a policy level. The government shows no remorse in landing the stairs of the foot overbridges or metro stations in the middle of the footpaths. Local politicians and policemen have no hesitation in allowing peddlers and swingers to occupy the footpaths meant for walkers. Landlords and shop owners have no qualms over marking their territory in public space. Pedestrians are a class that can be easily ignored. They do not have the united face that appears on the poster of a trade or worker's union. With no collective representation, they move like an abstract mass treated as nothing more than a nuisance by those on wheels.Sunil Gangopadhyay and Michel de Certeau thronged my Friday musings while thinking of the need for a skywalk to separate motorists from pedestrians to improve walkability in Dhaka city. Having lived in Manila and Bangkok for some time, I have fond memories of ambling along the skyway, also known as a sky bridge – an elevated pedway that connects two or more buildings or zones. Usually, these footbridges are covered to shelter pedestrians from the weather. In Seoul, they have created urban skyways as linear parks designed for walking or recreational purposes. With the pillars of the metro rail standing tall all over the city, there is a new contender for the section of the road. The space for pedestrian mobility is being squeezed by the minute. With our development projects focusing on mass transit, we've forgotten one minor thing: there would be pedestrians who would have to negotiate through the pillars to reach the stations. Especially in major junctions like Shahbagh, where we will have punters of different needs going to adjacent hospitals, universities, museums, malls, hotels, and parks, we will need a network of the pedestrian platform. They can be either in the form of a skywalk or a subway. We need to make room for pedestrians and ease their walkability. The drone view of Dhaka will indeed give a scenic picture where the metro rail and elevated roads run through it, but we need to create a space for the pedestrians, or else they will start making their own rules, which is never a good omen for any ruler. Dr Shamsad Mortuza is a professor of English at Dhaka University."

And Tk 206 crore more would be required to carry out awareness campaigns on EVMs, on voter education, and training officials. The rest will go towards administrative costs.""There was no feasibility test as we do not have that much time for completing all kinds of preparation for the next national election [in early 2024],"" said EVM Project Director Syed Raquibul Hasan, who was involved in the process of the DPP preparation.He said EVMs were used in six constituencies in the last parliamentary polls in December 2018. The EC has used EVMs in 900 other elections to local government bodies and several by-elections to parliamentary seats. ""We have the knowledge about feasibility of EVMs in election.""Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in several Ecnec meetings over the last couple of years, has, however, directed officials to invest in projects after conducting feasibility studies.The EVMs would be used in a maximum of 150 parliamentary constituencies during the 12th national polls. The EC currently has 1.5 lakh EVMs that can be simultaneously used in 70-80 constituencies.The EC sent the DPP to the finance ministry in September. The new EVMs would cost Tk 3.30 lakh each, including VAT and taxes. In 2018, the EC bought each machine for Tk 2.45 lakh.This time, the cost has increased due to the weak taka, Raquibul Hasan said.The DPP of the five-year project proposed setting up 10 warehouses in 10 regions. Each warehouse would have fool-proof security, firefighting equipment and thermostats for proper preservation of the machines.The Election Commission has chalked out a massive campaign to promote the use of EVMs among people and to educate them on how to vote using the machines.According to the DPP, the EC has planned to involve eminent citizens in the campaign to combat negative perceptions surrounding EVMs. It has also planned to create a mobile game to promote the positive sides of the EVMs.The EC is planning to use Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Imo, and WhatsApp, etc. as part of the campaign.The DPP also said that positive sides of the EVMs should be highlighted on bus and launch tickets, and at bus, rail, and launch stations and at schools, colleges, universities, madrasas, mosques, tea stalls, barber shops, super shops, drug stores, and other places people frequent.The EVM issue came to the fore especially after Hasina at an Awami League meeting on May 7 said voting machines should be used in all 300 constituencies."

/world/europe/news/failed-economic-plan-truss-quits-after-6-weeks-uk-pm-3148071,Failed economic plan: Truss quits after 6 weeks as UK PM,"British Prime Minister Liz Truss yesterday announced her resignation just six crisis-filled weeks after taking office, becoming the shortest-lived premier in UK history.Her Conservative party detailed a rapid process to elect a new leader on October 28, setting a high bar of 100 nominations among its MPs for candidates -- which might block any comeback by former premier Boris Johnson.The race will be effectively limited to three candidates at the start, before the 357 Tory MPs vote on their preferred candidate on Monday.Party members will then get an online vote, in an accelerated timetable that avoids the drawn-out contest in which Truss defeated Rishi Sunak over the summer following Johnson's resignation.Truss admitted she ""cannot deliver the mandate"" on which she was elected by the members, after her right-wing platform of tax cuts disintegrated and as many Conservative MPs revolted.Labour leader Keir Starmer, whose opposition party has surged in opinion polls on the back of Truss's short, eventful tenure, demanded a general election ""now"".""This is not just a soap opera at the top of the Tory party,"" he said, warning of ""huge damage"" to the UK economy, although the pound surged against the dollar after Truss's dramatic announcement.Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, Truss said she would stay on as prime minister until a successor was chosen to serve as Tory leader.""We've agreed that there will be a leadership election to be completed within the next week,"" she said, after senior backbench MP Graham Brady told her the game was up.""This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plan and maintain our country's economic stability and national security.""The new leader will be in place in time for new finance minister Jeremy Hunt to deliver a crucial budget statement on October 31.Hunt has already thrown out nearly all of debt-fuelled Truss's tax promises, which Sunak had warned would bring about higher inflation and market turmoil.Sunak's warnings were vindicated, and the former finance minister quickly emerged as the bookmakers' favourite. But he remains held in deep suspicion by Johnson loyalists.Johnson himself was eyeing a comeback, the Times and Telegraph newspapers reported, despite remaining deeply unpopular with many Tory MPs and the electorate for the many scandals that brought him down.Another potential runner is senior cabinet member Penny Mordaunt, who narrowly failed to make the Truss-Sunak runoff this summer.The end for Truss came after a key minister resigned and many Tory MPs rebelled over an important vote in chaotic scenes at the House of Commons late Wednesday.By yesterday morning, more than a dozen Conservative MPs had publicly urged Truss to resign, after her tax-cutting plans caused a market meltdown during an already severe cost-of-living crisis.Many more were reported to have submitted letters to Brady calling for Truss to be removed, although party rules would have forbidden another leadership campaign for 12 months.""The prime minister acknowledges yesterday was a difficult day and she recognises the public wanted to see the government focusing less on politics and more on delivering their priorities,"" her official spokesman told reporters.Barely two hours later, she quit, and will fall well short of Tory predecessor George Canning who served 118 days as prime minister in 1827 before dying in office.Amid Russia's war in Ukraine and growing economic problems, Britain's allies have been observing the tumult with concern, with political instability recurrent since the country voted in 2016 to quit the European Union.US President Joe Biden vowed to ""continue our close cooperation with the UK government"" on shared challenges including Ukraine.""It is important that Great Britain regains political stability very quickly, and that is all I wish,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said.For its part, the Russian foreign ministry said Britain has ""never known such a disgrace as prime minister"".Events reached a head after what right-wing tabloid The Sun called ""a day of extraordinary mayhem"" on Wednesday.Interior minister Suella Braverman left, apparently at Truss's demand after she sent a government document in a personal email.But Braverman, an arch right-winger who enjoys strong support among the Tory membership, used her resignation message to attack Truss in blistering terms.There then followed farcical scenes in parliament as many Tory MPs rebelled against the government's demand that they drop the party's manifesto commitment to maintain a ban on fracking."

Wari then took a 2-1 lead overall, with Emon beating Imran Hossain Rridoy 3-1 in the third match.

/opinion/the-third-view/news/will-free-media-be-harassed-the-name-data-protection-3147976,Will free media be harassed in the name of data protection?,"While Bangladesh is facing all sorts of challenges and our prime minister is regularly warning us about the food crisis that lies ahead, our government's relentless pursuit of putting impediments on the functioning of the free media continues unabated. Nothing appears to either slow the pace or dim the enthusiasm among a section of bureaucrats and policymakers, who appear to see nothing good in free media and miss no opportunity to shackle them under this pretext or another.The hugely restrictive and controversial Digital Security Act (DSA), which has already caused havoc to the free media in Bangladesh, has suddenly re-emerged with another set of restrictive initiatives that has us all in the media extremely worried. In a gazette published on October 2 by the ICT Division, 29 institutions have been declared as ""critical information infrastructure""(CII) under Article 15 of DSA.Protecting critical information infrastructure is the government's duty, and we are fine with it. From the media, we will be happy to raise public awareness in the area of cybersecurity. Here, the government and the media are on the same page, and we would be happy to work together.However, the problems start when we see the vague formulations and lack of clarity of the CII notification and the names of the institutions covered by it. Of the 29 listed bodies – the whole rationale remains unclear – the ones whose inclusion are most likely to hamper the work of journalism include the Bangladesh Bank and state-owned banks such as Sonali, Janata, Agrani and Rupali, the National Board of Revenue (NBR), Bridges Division, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges, and the Department of Immigration and Passports, just to mention a few.When an institution like Bangladesh Bank is designated as a CII without clearly mentioning whether the whole building is a ""critical information infrastructure"" or only its digitalised operating system, then of course journalists are left confused and worried. So when the next time a journalist enters the Bangladesh Bank, does he or she risk being accused of ""illegally"" entering a CII facility? Will that journalist then be prosecuted? The question is obviously of access to cover these institutions. Can a journalist now enter the premises of Biman, or the BPDB or even the two stock exchanges to carry out his or her duties?Let's examine the case of one institution: our national airlines. We can understand that the digital network that controls air traffic, the ticketing system, security for the planes, etc needs to be protected. But what about stories that deal with passenger services, Biman's profitability, its staff qualifications and performance, its commercial operations, its inflight services, etc? To cover these and similar stories, journalists need and must be given access to these institutions and the relevant officials. Being listed as a CII installation and without any clarification as to what is covered by it will definitely result in limiting our access, which may even be denied if sought frequently.Equally of concern is the dire possibility that the concerned officials will become more and more reluctant to share their insights with the media as the whole environment will be driven by restrictions. In time, we will be told that we can only deal with the public relations officer (PRO) of these institutions, and access to other officials will be denied. We might as well stop sending reporters and wait for the press releases from these bodies. We are afraid this new gazette will reduce journalism to ""public relations"" and prevent us from doing ""public service,"" which is why we exist.Then there is the issue of punishment that ranges from seven to 14 years in prison and a fine of up to Tk 5 crore. This high level of punishment together with the vagueness of the provisions makes it almost forbidding for journalists to carry out their professional tasks out of fear. Even life imprisonment is on the table for a crime whose mere definition we do not know.Supervising the whole process is a director-general whose power is enormous. The DSA states, ""If the director-general has reason to believe that any activity of an individual regarding any matter within his jurisdiction is threatening or detrimental to any critical information infrastructure, then he may, suo moto, or upon a complaint of any other person, inquire into the matter."" His conclusions may entail anything and, being a government servant, is not likely to reflect the media's point of view. Hence punishment can well be the result.As if to mock freedom of expression and all of us who demand it, on Wednesday, the government finalised the draft regulation for digital social media and OTT platforms that empowers the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) to block, take down or remove any content that ""threatens the secrecy of the government."" So, are we to understand that everything that a government does has to be considered a secret? It is the old ""official secrets act"" in a new bottle. What about the media's primary role of keeping the government accountable by revealing to the public the workings of their elected executive? Will any government voluntarily reveal that their projects are riddled with corruption or that they have failed to provide good governance? Such a provision will directly work against independent media, especially investigative reporting. The final draft clearly states that all the restrictive provisions will apply to ""publishers of news and current affairs content or a publisher of an online curated content."" The law may be vague in other aspects, but in restricting the media, it is amply clear.Over the last few days, with the gazette notification of ""critical information infrastructure"" and the final draft of the OTT rules, we have two new legal formulations meant to restrict the working of the free media.Are these in preparation for the coming election? We don't want to draw conclusions yet, but are finding it increasingly difficult not to. Pablo Neruda wrote, ""You may cut all the flowers, but you cannot keep spring from coming."" We say, ""You may prevent us from saying what we think to be right, but can you prevent us from thinking what is right?""Mahfuz Anam is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.

/business/economy/news/world-cups-fuel-demand-large-screen-tvs-3148371,World cups fuel demand for large screen TVs,"The demand for large-screen and premium-branded televisions has picked up in Bangladesh as sports-loving fans are gearing up to watch cricket and football world cups.    However, the sales of general TVs have not kept pace since a majority of consumers across the country have been feeling the pinch of economic pressure for several months because of the higher cost of living.Television sales in Bangladesh usually treble during world cups, whether it is cricket or football.Ritesh Ranjan, head of business at Transcom Digital, says the demand for high-end TVs has gone up for a week after the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup kicked off in New Zealand.Bangladesh's national cricket team is taking part in the tournament.High-end TVs usually are introduced targeting the higher-middle and high-income groups. TVs with sizes between 55 inches to 98 inches are considered premium brands.Transcom Digital sells 800 to 1,000 units of premium-branded TVs annually. ""But I believe sales will rise three times when the Fifa Football World Cup kicks off,"" Ranjan said.Md Shariful Islam, chief manager (product planning) of the consumer electronics division at Samsung Electronics Bangladesh, said the sales of premium TVs have increased by around 80 per cent in the last two months.The demand for the general segment TVs has gone up by 40 per cent during the period, he said.Mostafa Nahid Hossain, chief business officer of Walton Television, said the sales of Walton-branded TVs centring the T20I Cricket World Cup and the Fifa World Cup have increased remarkably.The 43-inch to 55-inch Walton TVs have huge demand, he said.According to industry people, general customers are yet to move to bring in any new TV set to their drawing room although the 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup has started, while the Fifa World Cup is just a month away. So, the festive mood among TV manufacturers and retailers is not visible yet.Still, manufacturers and distributors of TV companies such as Samsung, Sony, LG, Singer, Toshiba, Walton, Vision, Transtec, Jamuna, Sharp, Konka, and Minister have launched several new models of big-screen TVs to entice sports lovers.They have also introduced various offers, including cash incentives, equated monthly instalment (EMI) facilities and exchange offers.Transcom Digital, which retails Samsung and Transtec-branded TV at its outlets aiming to cater to the middle class to higher income people, is offering six to 36 months of EMI facilities to attract customers with credit cards from 34 banks and non-bank financial institutions.Recently, it started selling Sony televisions as well as those of ROWA, a TV brand in China.Samsung Electronics Bangladesh plans to introduce some special gifts and cash discounts throughout the Fifa World Cup.Walton is going to release some new models of the high-end premium series and looks to unveil special offers centring the World Cups.Esquire Electronics, the sole local distributor of Japanese electronic brands General and Sharp, has introduced promotional offers for the two events.""TV sales are almost the same as in normal times,"" said Md Manzurul Karim, general manager of the company.""We normally sell five sets a day whereas, during World Cups, it goes up to 11 to 12 units. But sales are poor this time.""The demand for TVs with sizes from 32 inches to 43 inches is yet to pick up as the middle class is cautious when it comes to spending owing to economic uncertainty, caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.The middle-income groups have been forced to put their purchases of luxury items largely on hold as their incomes have eroded by the persistently higher inflation and the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.Consumer prices have been rising since the beginning of the war on February 24. Inflation in Bangladesh surged to a multi-year high of 9.5 per cent in August and 9.1 per cent in September, forcing the people to tighten their belts as the war shows no sign of coming to an end.Industry people claim that 52 per cent of the country's television market is controlled by local manufacturers, with Walton topping the list with more than 25 per cent stake.Singer holds a 9 per cent share, Minister 4 per cent, Vision 3 per cent, and Jamuna 2 per cent.The rest 48 per cent of the market is controlled by foreign companies such as Samsung, Sony, LG, Sharp, Toshiba, and Xiaomi.Although there is no credible data on the TV market, industry insiders have put the annual demand at around 27 lakh, worth Tk 10,000 crore, or $1 billion. It was $636 million in 2020.Retailers expect the annual sales to cross 30 lakh units thanks to the Football World Cup."

However the Catalans played their way into the game as De Jong pulled the strings, and with Lewandowski up front, goals are never far away.- Soothing the pain -Just after the half-hour mark Jordi Alba guided Pedri's finely-weighted pass to Lewandowski, whose turn sent two defenders flying out of the picture, and a third flung himself in vain to try and block as the Poland international fired home.Lewandowski won an award for his scoring exploits on Monday at the Paris gala too, and combined with Kopa Trophy winner Gavi for the second goal.After being fed by the 18-year-old, voted the best under-21 player in the world, Lewandowski took his time on the edge of the box before arcing a superb strike out of Geronimo Rulli's reach and into the net.The third was quick to follow, with Ferran Torres setting up Fati, who hit the post with his first attempt but flicked the rebound home from virtually on the goal-line.Villarreal had let in three goals in their first nine games, then three more goals in an eight-minute spell at Camp Nou, as Barcelona offered a riposte to their critics.""We made rotations because the team had to be 100 percent to press high, not to single anybody out,"" said Xavi. ""It's not easy to be a Barcelona player, you have to be very emotionally balanced.""Former Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde returns with Athletic Bilbao on Sunday, before the Catalans host Bayern Munich, by which point they might be out of the Champions League, depending on Inter Milan's result against Viktoria Plzen.Fans chanted Xavi's name in support of the coach, after he had readily admitted his head would be on the chopping block if the club didn't win a trophy this season.More pain seems inevitable in the Champions League, but this victory at a canter ensures second-place Barcelona remain on Madrid's tail and firmly in the title fight.""(The attendance) tells me that the fans' hope is still intact,"" added Xavi.

Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers, who was Gerrard's manager for a time at Liverpool, said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" at the news.""It seems every day a manager loses his job or their job is under threat. I think stability and patience seems to be running out,"" Rodgers said. ""I believe with time and patience he could have got to where that football club wants to go.""Gerrard is the fourth Premier League manager to lose his job this season after Scott Parker (Bournemouth), Thomas Tuchel (Chelsea) and Bruno Lage (Wolves).Villa captain John McGinn said the players needed to take responsibility for the situation.""It's embarrassing to be part of. We've let the travelling fans down, the manager down. It's a bad night for us,"" he said.""It doesn't matter who's in charge of that team. It's nothing to do with the manager - the players have to look at themselves in the mirror.""Former Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur and Paris St Germain manager Mauricio Pochettino has emerged as an early favourite to take over from Gerrard."

Inspired by what he had learnt, Hossain collected six hens of three breeds before returning home in 2016.The 46-year-old now has 40 different breeds of chicken at his farm, which earns him a profit of between Tk 25,000 and Tk 30,000 per month.""I had to stop studying by the seventh semester of my diploma course on engineering due to poverty. I then went to the Maldives for work on borrowed money from relatives in 2011,"" he said.Hossain had returned home after five years and soon tried to leave for Europe but ultimately settled on rearing chickens after being cheated by a human trafficker.""Now I can make good profit by selling chickens and eggs,"" he added.Hossain had brought a pair of Brahma Chicken, Silkie Chicken, Milli Chicken from Chennai spending Tk 25,000 before returning to Bangladesh in 2016. He initially kept all the chicken in a corner of his living room.""I have always loved keeping animals and birds as pets and even trained under the Jubo Unnayan Department in 2007 on poultry farming,"" he said.""At first I thought I would just keep the chickens as pets rather than a commercial production but now, I earn a lot from the business,"" Hossain added.The 40 breeds of chicken now available at Hossain's farm with the pricier ones selling for between Tk 5,000 and Tk 70,000 per pair. He collected the chicken by visiting various countries, including Nepal, Bhutan, Vietnam, Indonesia.However, most of the breeds came from India, said Hossain, who spent five years to set up the farm.""I have already invested Tk 18 lakh in the business and can earn about Tk 50,000 per month excluding expenses by selling chickens, chicks and eggs,"" he added.However, Hossain went on to say that he struggled a lot in the past as he owed about Tk 20 lakh to different people, including relatives.""But the profit from this farm has helped me pay all debts and also build two houses at a cost of about Tk 12 lakh,"" he said.Hossain then said that people from all over the country personally contact him for chickens while he also has a webpage called, ""Ittadi Agro and Hatchery"".People of different ages, but mostly young men, come to Hossain for advice on how to build up a farm like his.""My target is to fulfil the demand of those people who collect different varieties of chickens from abroad. I sold one chicken for Tk 1.5 lakh a few months ago,"" he added.Md Nazmul Islam of Subidpur village under Faridganj upazila of Chandpur, said he has been buying different varieties of chicken from Hossain for the past one-and-a-half years and selling them in his own area.""I have been making good profit by selling these breeds, which people mostly buy as pets,"" he added.Islam then said he bought two three-day-old chickens from Hossain for Tk 1,000 and Tk 1,500 per piece.""After three months I can sell each for Tk 2,500 and Tk 15,000,"" he added.Mazran Sharif, a student of class 12 of Pangsha Government College, said he bought seven pairs of chicken from Hossain after seeing his video on YouTube.""I want to build a farm like him so that I can earn beside my study,"" Sharif added.Similarly, others have been inspired to follow in Hossain's footsteps as Md Joy from Satkharia collected 10 pairs of chickens from the farmer for Tk 50,000 about one year ago.""Now, all of my chickens have started giving eggs, some of which I hatch to expand my farm.

/business/economy/news/why-we-make-wrong-decisions-instant-gratification-3148346,Why we make wrong decisions – instant gratification,"One of the things that I learned while dealing with professional marketeers is that instant gratification is very important for any successful product promotion. But I often wonder why people prefer instant gratification.  It reminds me of my sons' childhood days when we would struggle in shopping malls to resist their desire to buy toys. They would demand and nag and at one point, start to cry refusing all our efforts of negotiations.At times we would even promise to get them something better just to manage the situation at hand. I am pretty sure that most parents have had similar experiences although there may be an exceptional few who may have managed their children without the usual tantrums. But what amuses me is that most of these children haven't changed much in their behaviour even as adults. You don't agree? Let's find out.In the last article, we discussed errors in comparison. The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time. Psychologists and behavioural economists have discovered that people use two simple rules: more is better than less, and now is better than later. Let me take three tests to explain!Test 1: You can have Tk 6,000 now or Tk 5,000 now. Simple, you all answered it right. All of us prefer more money as we understand more is better than less.Test 2: You can have Tk 6,000 today or Tk 6,000 after a month. Again, an easy decision, because we all know that now is better than later.Test 3: You can have Tk 5,000 now or Tk 6,000 after a month. Now, this has you thinking for a moment as two rules are conflicting.Most of you may have preferred the instant benefit of Tk 5,000. Why? By and large, people are enormously impatient. Popular research also suggests the same.Let's play with people's impatience here. Let's assume you can have Tk 5,000 after 12 months or alternatively Tk 6,000 after 13 months. Most of you would be happy to wait and grab Tk 6,000 after 13 months. The simple logic here is: if one can wait 12 months, he/she can also wait 13 months.The moment we bring a conflict into the two rules, dropping a variable, unexpectedly it gives rise to a dynamic contradiction, bewildering everyone. We suddenly find people opting to leave with Tk 5,000 instead of waiting a month unless if the wait time is reduced.Let's understand it better. Let's visualise a father with a height of six feet and his young daughter with a height of five feet, standing side by side.From a close distance, the height difference will be apparent. Seen from a hundred metres, the difference will be less visible and from further afar, the height difference will not be visible at all. But that does not mean that the actual height difference is not there. You can see Tk 5,000 now more clearly than Tk 6,000 after a month!Humans are the best creatures on earth and yet we have psychological inconsistencies which lead us to make wrong decisions. As humans, we underestimate the odds of our future pains and overestimate the value of our present pleasures. And this is the key reason behind biased decisions.The author is a telecom and management expert."
/sports/cricket/news/australia-gamble-without-back-keeper-better-balance-3148456,Australia gamble without back-up keeper for 'better balance',"Australia skipper Aaron Finch admitted they were taking a risk after not calling up another wicketkeeper for their Twenty20 World Cup defence starting on Saturday. The hosts lost back-up keeper Josh Inglis in bizarre circumstances this week after he badly cut his hand when the golf club he was playing with snapped.Australia replaced him in their squad with talented all-rounder Cameron Green, leaving them with no specialist replacement for first-choice gloveman Matthew Wade.The skipper said that veteran David Warner would most likely step up and take the gloves if need be and had done a bit of practice on Thursday.""We're taking the risk and not going with the extra keeper, which obviously has a degree of risk to it,"" said Finch on the eve of their clash in Sydney against New Zealand, a repeat of last year's final.Green is mainly in as cover and will not play against New Zealand in the first match of the Super 12 stage, Finch said, adding: ""We feel as though Cam gives us a little bit better balance to the squad.""Finch admitted that Australia were resistant to the idea of not having a reserve keeper and that it was a case of ""touch wood"".""That's definitely a risk, there's no doubt about that,"" said Finch, who will open the batting against New Zealand but put off naming his team.Finch said that he was with the 27-year-old Inglis when he badly hurt his hand on Wednesday, in what was supposed to be a relaxing round of golf for the squad.""That was a freak accident,"" he said. ""I was playing in Josh's group and I feel so bad for him.""We didn't realise the club broke, we just thought he hit it poorly, and he looked down and there's blood everywhere.""It was pretty distressing there for a little bit.""There is a high chance of rain for the match on Saturday but Finch said that would not fluster the hosts.""You do put so much time and effort into planning for all scenarios and you have to be flexible,"" he said.""The thing about rain is how much it affects the game -- if it's two overs it doesn't make much of a difference.""If it's a five-over game that makes a huge amount of difference."""
/news/bangladesh/news/nsu-land-procurement-former-trustees-intentionally-paid-tk-304cr-extra-3148386,NSU land procurement: Former trustees intentionally paid Tk 304cr extra ,"The members of a former board of trustees of North South University and a real estate company showed an inflated price of land on records and misappropriated about Tk 304 crore when it was purchased by the university, according to an investigation.The then board members showed on records that they had paid about Tk 535.19 crore to Ashaloy Housing and Developers for the land between 2016 and 2021, according to a probe report of the Anti-Corruption Commission.The actual price of the land was about Tk 231 crore.The real estate company deposited about Tk 91.5 crore to the trustees' personal bank accounts in bribe, reads the report written by ACC Director Farid Ahmed Patwary.ACC Secretary Mahbub Hossain yesterday said charges were pressed against the suspects.On May 5, the ACC sued former trustee board chairman Azim Uddin Ahmed and members MA Kashem, Benajir Ahmed, Rehana Rahman and Mohammed Shajahan, and Ashaloy Housing and Developers Managing Director Amin Md Hilaly.The real estate company's Chairperson Omar Faruk, and directors Anwara Begum and Syed AK Anwaruzzaman were added in the list of accused during the investigation.According to the charges pressed, the NSU made an agreement with the company for buying land in Jangir, Gutiab and Pitolganj mouza of Narayanganj's Rupganj.The university paid the company Tk 500 crore for 8,250 decimals of land in 2016. The university paid Tk 35.19 crore for another 846.88 decimals of land in the same mouzas between 2019 and 2021.Analysing the selling price of adjacent pieces of land of the same mouzas, investigators found that the university paid the extra amount of about Tk 304 crore to the company.According to the Private University Act 2010, the trustee board is the highest authority of a university, which, as per rules and regulations, is a non-profit organisation.Without the consent of the university's syndicate, University Grants Commission and education ministry, the board of trustees illegally paid Tk 304 crore extra for a campus on the 9096.88 decimals of land.NSU, the first private university in Bangladesh, was established in 1992 as a charitable, non-profit, non-commercial, and non-political organisation."
/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/media-can-help-navigate-bilateral-issues-3148261,Bangladesh-India ties: Media can help untangle complexities,"The proactive, collaborative roles of media in Bangladesh and India can help address the complexities in their bilateral ties, said senior journalists from the two countries.They observed that many a time, misreporting or not pointing out problems leads to tension between the two neighbouring countries, whose relationship is special because of their common history and culture, and owing to India's contribution in Bangladesh's fight for independence.Therefore, the ties are more people-to-people, which should be nurtured. This is where the critical role of journalists comes in to enhance the ties. To do this, they should not become victims of politics.The observations were made at a seminar titled ""Role of Media in Bangladesh-India Relations: Challenges and Prospects"", organised by Jatiya Press Club at its premises yesterday, marking the golden jubilee of Bangladesh's independence and 68th founding anniversary of the club.Addressing the inaugural event virtually, Jatiya Sangsad Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury said Dhaka and Delhi have taken the relationship to new heights in the last decade, by addressing maritime and land boundary issues as well as improving connectivity and trade.The two countries can solve the complexities through dialogue and play an essential role in regional integration. Media can play an important role to this end, she said.In his speech as guest of honour, The Daily Star Editor and Publisher Mahfuz Anam proposed that Bangladesh establish a specialised centre, like a ""India Study Institute"", to explore all potentials of Indo-Bangla ties. India can also set up a similar institute on Bangladesh.These centres can provide intellectual guidance on how to further deepen the relations.He also suggested that the institutes be funded by the private sector.Anam said the bilateral ties between the two nations are deep, but there are many complexities as well, which need to be addressed through a friendly, cooperative approach.One of the major concerns for India was security in its north-east, which was rightly addressed by Bangladesh, and such cooperation should continue, he said.Anam said although the two countries signed the Ganges Agreement in 1996, the water-sharing issue has not evolved smoothly. The Teesta deal remaining unsigned is frustrating for Bangladesh.Besides, he requested the Indian journalists not to look at Bangladesh through its relations with any other country.Stressing on water sharing, Indian Journalists' Union President Geetartha Pathak said Bangladesh, as a lower riparian country, has the right to get sufficient water from the 54 common rivers, but that is not being ensured.Bangladesh suffers from both flooding and drought, he said. ""I hope journalists of both countries will focus on this issue.""He said in Assam, so-called ""illegal infiltrators from Bangladesh"" have been made into a big issue because of power politics. If political parties' motives go against human rights, the media should highlight it.Pathak said if a society is dominated by its religious identity, there is a high risk that the society will be divided. Journalists of the two countries should work on these issues.Prothom Alo Joint Editor Sohrab Hossain said political leaders face various obstacles, as they need to make their voters happy, but the media should not give into those forces. They should report objectively.However, the media sometimes play the religion and nationality card, he said, calling upon journalists to have more collaboration and cooperation.Press Club of India President Gautam Lahiri said water scarcity is shown as a reason for not signing the Teesta deal. ""But I think whatever water is there should be shared because it is a right of Bangladesh.""He said the Citizens Amendment Act (CAA) -- which was enacted to give citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan -- could not be implemented yet because of media pressure.When Lahiri talked to the Hindu community in Bangladesh, they said they want to solve problems in their own country, not take shelter in India, taking advantage of the CAA, he said.Lahiri said border killing has been a thorny issue, but the media has not properly reported on it. He suggested the media of both countries take a joint initiative of investigation for such issues.Ekattor TV Editor-in-Chief Mozammel Babu, GTV Editor-in-Chief Syed Ishtiaque Reza, Bhorer Kagoj Editor Shyamal Dutta, Indian journalist Mohua Chatterjee, Jatiya Press Club General Secretary Elias Khan, Dhaka Union of Journalists President Sohel Haider Chowdhury, senior journalist Monjurul Ahsan Bulbul, and Dhaka University International Relations Prof Imtiaz Ahmed also spoke at the event, chaired by Jatiya Press Club President Farida Yasmin."

/sports/cricket/news/red-ball-assignment-view-who-will-take-charge-3148006,Red-ball assignment in view but who will take charge?,"India will arrive in Bangladesh for their first tour since 2015 to play three ODIs and two Tests on December 1, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said on Thursday.While a majority of the red-ball players are in Australia to play the T20I World Cup, a few stalwarts such as Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mominul Haque are playing in the ongoing National Cricket League (NCL) to gear up for the assignment against India.However, Russell Domingo, relinquished of T20I duties and told to focus on ODI and Tests, is yet to arrive in the country to gauge NCL performances. Domingo was set to travel to Dubai with the A team before that tour was scrapped.Later, the BCB XI, a side featuring Test stars Mominul and Mahmudul Hasan Joy, saw their tour of India to play Tamil Nadu postponed. It was learned that the BCB XI would tour India on October 22 for two four-day and three one-day matches as the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association finally managed the go-ahead from the union ministry. However, Domingo will not be part of that tour either.Domingo had said during a press conference in August that he would attend NCL games in mid-November. A BCB source yesterday informed that, as per schedule, Domingo would be in Bangladesh for the NCL. The last round of matches is slated for November 14-17, but another source, a BCB higher-up requesting anonymity, informed that they were 'still looking but it is likely someone new will be appointed as solution' when asked whether Domingo would be staying on.Domingo's future remains pretty much up in the air still and it is a possibility he may not attend NCL matches. Past that, he may be replaced as head coach although his contract with BCB runs through to the ODI World Cup in India.Dhaka will play host to the three ODIs against India, scheduled for December 4, 7 and 10th while the two Tests, part of the World Test Championship, are slated to be played from December 14-18 and December 22-26 with the first in Chattogram and the latter in Dhaka.India, currently fourth in 2021-2023 WTC cycle, will place importance on the two Tests as it will factor heavily into their hopes of qualifying for the final. Thus, bar one or two shake-ups, a near full-strength squad is expected to arrive in Bangladesh.The last time Bangladesh hosted India in 2015, the lone Test in Fatullah ended in a draw. This time, a majority of the players are in Australia. The Super 12 stage ends on November 6 and, barring any unprecedented results, Bangladesh are likely to head back after that stage. But it still gives very little time for the rest of the Test squad to prepare for the India tour.The players playing in the BCB XI tour and the NCL will get much-needed preparation for the series but how the majority of the pace stars return to the red-ball format will be crucial to Bangladesh's chances in the home series. Without Domingo, the plans for the series and who will guide the team remain cloudy at the moment.Itinerary for India tourDec. 4 - First ODI - MirpurDec. 7 - Second ODI - MirpurDec. 10 - Third ODI - MirpurDec. 14-18 - First Test - ChattogramDec. 22-26 - Second Test - Mirpur"
/business/economy/news/rising-living-cost-could-drive-many-poverty-cpd-3148376,Rising living cost could drive many into poverty: CPD,"Many households in Bangladesh are at risk of falling into poverty due to soaring food and non-food prices, warned the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) yesterday.The caution comes as inflation reached 9.52 per cent, a 10-year high, in August before coming down slightly to 9.1 per cent in September, compounding the hardship for the low-income families, who were trying to recover from pandemic induced income losses.Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020, the poor and low-income group has been facing challenges as the cost of living has climbed.But their struggle has become harder as higher commodity prices, exacerbated by the Ukraine-Russia war and several domestic factors such as the hike in the prices of petroleum, an expensive dollar, and the market distortion by a few dominating businesses, continue to persist.As a result, the average monthly cost of a basket of 19 common food items increased from Tk 17,530 on January 1 of 2019 to Tk 22,421 on October 16 this year for a household of four persons in Dhaka city, the CPD said in its review on challenges faced by Bangladesh amid the slowdown in the global economy.The think tank shared its observation at a press briefing at its office.It said the cost rose to Tk 9,059 from Tk 6,541 if the household accepts a compromised diet with no fish, mutton, beef, or chicken on their plates.Food prices rose to 9.94 per cent in August before decelerating to 9.13 per cent in September, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.""As the burden of rising prices weighs heavily on their meagre incomes, these households continue to struggle,"" said CPD Executive Director Fahmida Khatun.""Apart from the high price of basic food items, the escalated price of non-food items is putting a huge burden on households.""Non-food inflation rose to 91.3 per cent in September.""So, maintaining even a modest standard of living is becoming prohibitively expensive for households in Dhaka,"" the CPD said, adding that out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare for a household also increased in the absence of support from the government.The CPD thinks the existing minimum wage for workers in all industries would not be sufficient for affording a regular diet for a family of four even if it is assumed that workers got a 5 per cent annual increment of their basic wages.Bangladesh maintains a poverty rate of 20.5 per cent estimated in December 2019 and the government has not published any poverty data assessing the impact on the poor although non-government studies found a spike in the number of poor people.Citing a Food and Agriculture Organisation report, the CPD said seven million people, mostly residing in rural areas, in nine districts in Bangladesh's northeast, were badly impacted by two waves of disastrous flash floods in May and June.Nearly 93 per cent of the impacted people were compelled to adopt at least one negative coping technique such as missing meals, succumbing to debt, and depleting productive assets as a consequence of the abrupt loss of livelihoods and supplies of food, it said.It said inflation could have been contained better had the government removed import tariff and taxes on 29 essential food items that currently face a high tax incidence.""Thus, a fiscal policy which is highly dependent on indirect taxes propagates economic inequality in society and forces the government to trade off revenue generation in the face of high inflation,"" said the CPD.""The import tax and duties should reduce.""The CPD found that several necessities, whether they are produced locally or imported from a more developed country, are more costly in Bangladesh than in other developing or developed nations.For example, it said, the price of a piece of bread weighing 500 grammes is higher in Dhaka than in Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India and Nepal.""The current inflation figure is not painting the real scenario of people's plight,"" said Fahmida.Towfiqul Islam Khan, a senior research fellow of the CPD, said Bangladesh could have been in a better position if the government had undertaken reforms.""As the reforms did not take place, the tax-to-GDP ratio is still low in the country.""""If the ratio goes up, the fiscal space of the government will widen. Then, the government will be able to support the poor."""
/business/economy/news/govt-looks-cut-trade-gap-malaysia-3148361,Govt looks to cut trade gap with Malaysia,"The potential of Bangladesh's exports to Malaysia remains untapped due to the high duty imposed on goods sent from the country, according to Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi.Meanwhile, the value of imports from Malaysia more than doubled in the last fiscal year, indicating that bilateral trade is heavily tilted in favour of the southeast Asian nation.So, Bangladesh has already sent a list of goods for duty waiver in a bid to export more products to Malaysia and thereby reduce the large trade gap between the two countries.""If a duty waiver is provided on those products, then the trade gap may narrow to some extent,"" Munshi said after meeting with Haznah Md Hashim, the high commissioner of Malaysia to Bangladesh, at the minister's secretariat office in Dhaka yesterday.As Bangladesh imports vegetable fat and palm oil in bulk from Malaysia, the balance of trade between the two countries is heavily tilted towards the latter, he added.Bangladesh imported goods worth $3.28 billion from Malaysia in fiscal 2021-22 while exporting goods worth $337.81 million at the same time, according to data from the commerce ministry.In fiscal 2020-21, the value of Bangladesh's imports from Malaysia stood at $1.57 billion while exports totalled $306.57 million, the data shows.Apart from vegetable fat and palm oil, Bangladesh imports petroleum products, vegetable products, prepared foodstuffs, wood and articles of wood, and chemicals from Malaysia.On the other hand, Bangladesh exports mainly garment items, jute yarn and twine, raw jute, leather and footwear, shrimp and engineering products to the island nation.Hashim said the popularity of Malaysian cars has been gaining worldwide but Bangladesh cannot import them in large volumes due to the country's high tariff on motor vehicles.With this backdrop, the high commissioner demanded a reduction in the import duty levied on cars from Malaysia.She also said that there is ample opportunity to increase bilateral trade, which is something Malaysia wants to do."
