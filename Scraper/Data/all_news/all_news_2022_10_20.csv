The court also rejected remand and bail prayers sought for the 22 in the same case.Dhaka Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate passed the order after Sub-Inspector Md Golam Hossain Khan of Shahbagh Police Station, also the investigation officer of the case, appeled for a senday-day remand.In the forwarding report, the IO said all the 24 accused, including several unnamed people assaulted the complainants and their associates.Moreover, the accused threatened them while leaving the place of occurrence. That is why they need to be remanded to find out correct names and addresses of other fugitives responsible for carrying out the attacks, he added.Defence, however, submitted separate petitions, seeking bail along with cancellation of the remand prayers on grounds that their clients were allegedly attacked by BCL men mercilessly.But the victims, who were supposed to file cases against the actual attackers, were instead sued, arrested, and sent to jail, the lawyer of the accused said.Upon hearing both the sides, the magistrate turned the defence pleas and placed Akhter and Akram on a one-day remand for quizzing about the incident. The rest 22 were sent to jail after rejecting both the remand and bail petitions.The court fixed October 25, for hearing on a seven-day remand prayer in another attempted murder case filed by another BCL man.On October 11, another Dhaka court rejected the bail petitions submitted by the accused, who said they were attacked by Chhatra League men on the Dhaka University campus on October 7.Nazim Uddin, organising secretary of BCL, and its activist Aminur Rahman filed the two attempt-to-murder cases at Shahbagh Police Station, accusing 25 named and 140-150 unnamed people.On the day of the attack on October 7, police detained 24 of the accused from Dhaka Medical College Hospital and other nearby areas in connection with the incident.Among the detainees were several who were receiving treatment for their injuries from the attack."
/business/economy/news/misuse-industrial-plots-spotted-rajshahi-bscic-3147371,Misuse of industrial plots spotted at Rajshahi BSCIC,"Abdul Malek was allocated a plot inside an industrial estate of the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) in Rajshahi back in the 1970s.Since then, he has managed to lease an additional six plots totalling 18,000 square feet in area to expand his food, textile and dying units, the latter two of which deal with producing Rajshahi silk.It was not always smooth sailing for Malek though as his business began to crumble when the comparatively pricey Rajshahi silk started to lose out to cheaper alternatives in the 1980s.In order to survive, he handed over one of his plots to a fellow businessperson, and closed his textile and dying factories while continuing with his food industry in a small scale.However, Malek's luck turned around when he happened to become general secretary of the BSCIC Industry Owners Association.He allegedly started misusing his authority to illegally sub-let industrial plots, at least one of which was used to establish a light engineering workshop.In addition, he has been using a plot as a residence with his family, which goes against regulations in this regard.Malek is not alone though as earlier this year, authorities of the BSCIC industrial estate in Rajshahi found that at least 14 other businesspeople have been using their plots for residential purposes or renting them out illegally for the past three decades.Upon being warned thrice, nine of those businesspeople eventually moved away but the remaining five, including Malek, have never paid any heed.The five units that continue to flaunt rules are: Keramat Rice Mills, Raj Metal industries, Rasa Bakery and Shamim Engineering Workshop.""They [the five industrialists] want to stay at the estate at any cost and argue they have no alternative,"" Zafar Wazed, deputy general manager of the Rajshahi BSCIC said.Wazed was head of the committee that spotted the illegal activities of plot owners for the first time in the last 35 years.He said their investigation revealed that the estate was developed in 1962 mainly focusing on the thriving silk businesses.""Authorities insisted that businesspeople who receive these industrial plots engage in the silk businesses,"" he said.Later, when the situation changed and business methods were transformed, many plot owners failed to adapt and ultimately succumbed to bankruptcy, Wazed added.On the other hand, Malek has other views.""The BSCIC authorities collect a yearly service charge of Tk 3,500 for each 1,000 square feet but they don't provide any service,"" he said.Asked about his illegal residence at the industrial plot, Malek said he is staying there for security reasons.""Incidents of theft are occurring almost every night due to the lack of security,"" he added.However, BSCIC officials says there should be no plea for flouting the rules as most plot owners are abide by them.Some other plot owners also reported various crises at the estate, including mismanagement, and said that industries there cannot not grow due to the lack of facilities.For example, there is no boundary wall at the estate while most roads are damaged and the drainage system is in dire condition.Besides, uninterrupted power supply remains a challenge while the gas supply is costly, making it difficult for industry owners to maintain a low production cost.Industries at the Rajshahi industrial estate have long been demanding a separate power line but to no avail, and several industries have had to manage gas connections on their own initiative.Most factories are not applying for gas connections considering the high connection costs and so, they demand the installation of a common gas pipeline to reduce this expense.Liaqat Ali, president of the Rajshahi BSCIC Industry Owners' Association, said the transportation of raw materials is another problem due to the lack of direct railway, waterway or air cargo facilities.""We have been raising our demands in different forums for a long time but we don't see any improvement,"" he added.Rajshahi BSCIC Deputy General Manager Wazed said the authorities have started implementing some development projects to improve the roads, drainage and other facilities.As the demand for industrial plots has increased, the authorities have initiatives to identify sick projects, providing them support and handing over vacant plots to promising entrepreneurs, BSCIC officials said.Keramat Rice Mills was allotted two plots in the 1970s but after the introduction of auto rice mills in the late 1990s, older units like this one have stopped operations.When its owner Keramat Ali died, his nine inheritors started living at the plots instead of doing any industrial production.Later when the BSCIC authorities sent them notices, they stopped staying at the plots but rented them out to three other families who installed oil, chanachur and plastic factories in a small scale.BSCIC officials said they have proposed cancelling the plot allotments to those who have been violating rules despite repeated notices.A decision on the proposal is likely to come in a couple of weeks, they added."

This includes telecom service providers, network service providers, internet service providers, social media firms, web hosting services, search engines, online payment sites, and online markets.The final draft empowers the government to issue take-down orders to individuals or entities, within or outside of Bangladesh.If the order is not complied with, Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) could order access to the content be blocked.All these provisions are also applicable for ""publishers of news and current affairs content or a publisher of an online curated content"".While granting the government indemnity, the draft states, ""If any person is affected by any order or instruction issued under the provisions of this regulation [...] in good faith, then he may not file any suit for compensation against the minister or an employee of the government, or the chairman, other commissioners, or any officer, employee or consultant of the commission.""The draft regulation did not define ""in good faith"".It also states that the commission will not be liable for any loss or damage incurred by stakeholders.The final draft of the regulation states that all intermediaries must keep a team on the ground to liaise with law enforcement round the clock and coordinate with the BTRC to ensure compliance with the regulation.All intermediaries providing such content must be registered, and the registration depends on their adherence to these regulations, and the commission harbours the power to revoke or deny registration. All registrations are valid for five years at a stretch.The latest draft kept intact provisions for fines if the regulations were violated but removed the ceilings that were mentioned in the previous drafts. Instead, it just added that the ""fine should not be excessive"".Speaking at a meeting at the home ministry, chief of the cabinet committee on law and order and Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque said the government was preparing to clamp down on rumours being spread from abroad.""Such cyber criminals can't be controlled as they all live overseas. We will be examining how they can be identified and how steps can be taken against them,"" he said.In July 2020, Supreme Court lawyer Md Tanvir Ahmed submitted a writ petition to the HC saying that several over-the-top (OTT) platforms contain questionable and obscene content and films from Bangladesh and India that cause moral degradation of people.The HC bench of Justice JBM Hassan and Justice Razik-Al-Jalil fixed November 29 for passing any further order on this matter. On that day, the Ministry of Information too will be submitting an updated regulation on OTT platforms."

Commencing their venture from 17 June, 2022, Yatai has made its mark significantly in the food scene in only three months.Upon our entrance, we were moved by the classy decor illuminating a beautiful colour combination around the place. They had a mini book-shelf, a live kitchen and an angelic wall (literally). Overall, the premises looked cosy but conventional at the same time; enumerating a picturesque view for both formal office lunches or just a casual hang out with friends.""The initial response really surprised us. We were optimistic but did not expect such overwhelmingly positive feedback; that too, without involving influencer marketing or anything of that sort. I guess that is because satisfying quality and customer service is what everyone seeks at the end of the day, it is the best form of marketing,"" shared Tanjir Rahman Arnob, the owner of the restaurant.Arnob is an MBA graduate from North South University who began his journey with Yatai (a word for shop stand in Japanese) in Rajshahi. He chose the distant area of Rajshahi instead of the bustling Dhaka city then, as he identified the market gap for many job holders who reside there but are not accommodated with the right place to dine in. Over time, Yatai emerged victorious there and finally made itself a new home in the capital.Our feast began with the serving of colourful Maki Rolls as appetizers: Volcano, California, Fried Prawns, Chicken Teriyaki and much more — all prepared in front of our eyes in the live kitchen. The rolls tasted delish, given that the chefs tried to incorporate a hint of local taste in the dish; delivering a perfect blend of spices, sweet and savoury. Next was the tummy-filling Classic Bento Box — consisting of all items that a bento usually offers. Starting from rice, chicken nanban, tempuras, katsu chicken, etc. accompanied by flavourful honey mustard and soya sauce — all arranged together. Although the tempuras seemed a little under-fried as per our taste, the other items provided in the bento box were top notch; both in times of quality and quantity. Also, the menu exhibited other varieties of soup, dumplings and bento boxes too:  seafood, supreme and Yatai special that we have plans of endeavouring in our next visits. ""I realized the Bangladeshi youth is versatile. They will try to adapt to anything new that we offer them at affordable prices,"" added Arnob.Next, the bill came in with the pre-ordered seasonal fresh fruit juices, energizing our bloated tummies to a great extent. Indeed, what Arnob said was true. The youth is actually happy to try new food at reasonable prices, as the total bill amounted to around Tk 1800-2000 for a fulfilling meal for two, including palatable sushi items (which are usually so pricey elsewhere in the capital).Finally, as we were done with our shares of the aesthetic photo session, we stood up to leave. Just then, a voice echoed behind our backs.""Ma'am, please wait. Here's a complimentary dessert for you! A gesture for our loyal customers, as we hope for you to be.""We felt like happy children on cloud nine as we devoured the creamy, smoking brownie topped with vanilla ice-cream as a finish to our amazing experience at Yatai."

""I told the team it was very enjoyable to watch.""The Red Devils had 28 shots on goal against a Tottenham side that been beaten only once in their opening 10 league games of the season.Signs of progress for United since losing their opening two games of the campaign have been hampered by a lack of killer instinct up front.But they finally got their rewards in front of a delighted full house when Fred's deflected effort found the bottom corner two minutes into the second half.Bruno Fernandes then doubled United's lead with his first club goal since August.Tottenham could have moved to within a point of leaders Arsenal with victory, but their performance had Antonio Conte questioning whether they can compete for the title. ""I think we need time,"" said the Italian. ""In only 10 or 11 months you cannot pass from ninth place to become, the year after, a title contender.

/sports/football/news/benzema-target-madrid-crush-elche-3147491,Benzema on target as Madrid crush Elche,"Karim Benzema celebrated his Ballon d'Or win this week with a goal in Real Madrid's comfortable 3-0 win over Elche on Wednesday night, in which they also had three strikes disallowed for offside.Fede Valverde and Marco Asensio scored the other goals as the La Liga leaders cruised to victory.Benzema, though, was the star turn: he hit the back of the net three times in total but had two scratched off while David Alaba also had an effort ruled out.It has been a spectacular week for Carlo Ancelotti's side. They sealed qualification to the Champions League last 16, beat Barcelona in the Clasico, saw Benzema crowned the world's best player, and then moved six points clear at the top of La Liga with this comfortable victory.Fresh from the glitzy Paris gala on Monday night, reigning champions Madrid brought that same swagger to Spain's east coast and bottom-of-the-table Elche never stood a chance.""The team played well, they were very good in attack. We had a lot of mobility,"" said Ancelotti.""It's an important moment in the season, the team is doing well, we don't have doubts, we don't have problems.""Benzema appeared to send Madrid ahead in the sixth minute after a slick team move but Vinicius Junior had edged offside in the build-up and it was disallowed.Los Blancos did not have to wait long for the opener, with Valverde continuing his own superb form by blasting home from the edge of the box.Madrid had picked Elche apart and only a desperate block denied Benzema, but the visitors kept the move alive and when the ball broke to Valverde, he netted his sixth goal of the season across all competitions.The Uruguayan netted in Sunday's Clasico win over Barcelona and has become a key offensive weapon for his team, even though on this occasion he was deployed in midfield, instead of on the right wing.Ancelotti had previously claimed he would tear up his coaching license if Valverde did not score at least 10 goals this season, and the Uruguayan said he did not want that to happen.""I am concentrating on making it happen, it's a nice pressure and I don't want to be blamed for him retiring as a coach, it gives me the desire to go looking for goals,"" Valverde told DAZN.Alaba had a goal ruled out later on in a half in which Madrid dominated, but Elche started the second period strongly, with Lucas Boye slapping a volley narrowly over.At the other end Benzema bit back with a long-range strike which Edgar Badia beat away. The Elche goalkeeper has made more saves than any of his counterparts in La Liga, and this was another busy night.The officials in the VAR booth were kept busy too, with Benzema seeing another goal disallowed for offside. After 75 minutes Benzema eventually got one which counted, his fifth of the season in La Liga, set-up by a sweet backheel from Rodrygo to complete a one-two.Madrid substitute Marco Asensio wrapped up the victory in the final stages with a hooked finish from Rodrygo's cross.Elsewhere Mikel Merino's strike earned Real Sociedad a 1-0 win over Real Mallorca to help the Basque side displace Atletico Madrid and move third.Imanol Alguacil's team have won eight consecutive games between La Liga and the Europa League, despite losing striker Alexander Isak to Newcastle and then his replacement Umar Sadiq to a bad knee injury for the season.However the match was overshadowed by the news that a Real Sociedad supporter had died. A man was taken away from the Reale Arena on a stretcher before the game started, with the club later confirming he passed away.Real Betis, fifth, could only draw 0-0 at 19th place Cadiz, while Real Valladolid thrashed Celta Vigo 4-1."

We have given special cards to one crore people to purchase food at a fair price and are providing food free of cost to the people unable to purchase essentials,"" she said.The prime minister said her government would be able to face the present situation as they have successfully overcome the challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic.""We know many people can criticise, but we don't need to pay heed to their criticism, rather we will discharge our duties for the country and its people,"" she said.After inaugurating the RPV installation, Sheikh Hasina said, ""Today is a very important day for us and we feel very proud as we have been able to reach Bangladesh to another height through the installation. The day will be written in Bangladesh's history as a day of achievement.""Expressing her gratitude to the Russian government and its President Vladimir Putin for extending help to set up a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh, she said Bangladesh has set an example by ensuring that nuclear power is meant for peace and development.The prime minister said the first unit of the nuclear power plant will supply 1,200 MW of power in 2023 while the same amount of electricity will be available from the second unit in 2024.She said the electricity would be greatly beneficial for the socio-economic advancement of the people, particularly of North Bengal which was once known for Monga and famine."
/business/economy/news/global-cereal-prices-stable-two-weeks-3147356,Global cereal prices stable for two weeks,"The agricultural and cereal price indices have remained stable for the past two weeks and are only one percentage point higher from a fortnight ago, said the Food Security Update of the World Bank.  Cereal prices were relatively stable, while wheat prices increased by 3 per cent and maize prices by 4 per cent, while rice prices, which have remained relatively stable, fell by 0.2 per cent.Average wheat, maize, and rice prices in October 2022 are, however, 18 per cent, 27 per cent, and 10 per cent higher than in October 2021, respectively. Meanwhile, wheat and maize prices are 38 per cent and 4 per cent higher, respectively, and rice prices are 21 per cent lower than in January 2021.The war in Ukraine has altered global patterns of trade, production, and consumption of commodities in ways that will keep prices at high levels through the end of 2024 exacerbating food insecurity and inflation, said the WB.High food prices have triggered a global crisis that is driving millions more into extreme poverty, magnifying hunger and malnutrition.The number of people who are experiencing acute food insecurity and will need urgent assistance is likely to climb to 222 million people in 53 countries and territories, said a report of the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.According to a paper of the International Monetary Fund, $5 billion to $7 billion in further spending is needed to assist vulnerable households in 48 countries most affected by the higher food and fertiliser import prices. An additional $50 billion is required to end acute food insecurity over the next 12 months.The global food crisis has been partially made worse by the growing number of food trade restrictions put in place by countries with the goal of increasing domestic supply and reducing prices.Following the start of the war in Ukraine, trade-related policies imposed by countries have surged. As of October 10, some 21 countries have implemented 26 food export bans, and eight have implemented 12 export-limiting measures, said the WB.After some brief relief in the summer of 2022, fertilizer prices are beginning to rise again. In addition to increasing energy prices, policy measures such as export restrictions have limited global fertiliser availability."

/news/asia/news/xi-would-be-sinner-not-winner-chinese-if-attacks-island-taiwan-3147511,"Xi would be “sinner,” not winner for Chinese, if attacks island: Taiwan","Chinese President Xi Jinping would become a ""sinner"" of all Chinese people if he attacked Taiwan and would not win a war as he would face international sanctions and diplomatic isolation, Taiwan's top security official said on Thursday.China has ramped up military and political pressure against democratically governed Taiwan over the past two years as it seeks to assert its sovereignty claims, which the government in Taipei strongly rejects.Opening a twice-a-decade congress of China's ruling Communist Party on Sunday, Xi said it was up to the Chinese people to resolve the Taiwan issue and that China would never renounce the right to use force but still strive for a peaceful resolution.Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of parliament, Chen Ming-tong, head of Taiwan's National Security Bureau said Xi would face disaster if he followed through on his threats of ever attacking Taiwan.""There is no possibility of winning in using force to attack Taiwan,"" Chen said.China would face international sanctions and diplomatic isolation for doing so, he added.""Xi would forfeit the so-called great rejuvenation of the Chinese people, and become a sinner of the Chinese people,"" Chen said, using a term that refers to those who are ethnically Chinese rather than of Chinese nationality.Taiwan's government says only the island's 23 million people can decide their future, and that as Taiwan has never been ruled by the People's Republic of China its sovereignty claims are void.
""It's very clear that the two sides should respect each other and develop separately, which is the way that will bring happiness to the people,"" Chen said.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly offered to resume talks with China based on the principles of equality and mutual respect, but Beijing has rebuffed those advances insisting she must first acknowledge that Taiwan is part of China.Tsai is overseeing a military modernisation programme to respond to China's growing threat, which in August included war games carried out near the island as Beijing angrily responded to a visit to Taipei by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi."
/sports/football/news/prosecutors-appeal-blatter-platini-acquittal-fifa-fraud-trial-3147616,"Prosecutors appeal Blatter, Platini acquittal in FIFA fraud trial","Swiss prosecutors said Thursday that they had filed an appeal against the acquittal of former football chiefs Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini over a suspected fraudulent payment.Blatter and Platini, once the chiefs of world and European football respectively, were cleared on July 8 by the Federal Criminal Court in a trial following a mammoth investigation that began in 2015.The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG) told AFP that it had filed the appeal before the deadline was reached Wednesday night, confirming a report in L'Equipe.Switzerland's top prosecutor ""has applied for the full annulment of the first-instance judgement,"" a spokeswoman for the Office of the Attorney General wrote in an email.The prosecutors reportedly had 20 days to make their intentions clear after the reception of the full verdict from the Federal Criminal Court, based in the southern city of Bellinzona, on September 29.Former FIFA president Blatter, 86, and Platini, 67, were cleared of the allegations that shook world football and torpedoed their time at the top.The Federal Criminal Court rejected the prosecution's request for a suspended prison sentence of a year and eight months.The trial revolved around payment for Platini's work as an adviser to Blatter between 1998 and 2002.Platini was accused of having submitted to FIFA in 2011 an allegedly fictitious invoice for a claimed debt still outstanding for his advisory work.They signed a contract in 1999 for an annual remuneration of 300,000 Swiss francs, which was paid in full by FIFA.But the pair were tried over a two million Swiss franc ($2.06 million) payment in 2011 to Platini, who was then in charge of European football's governing body UEFA.Blatter told the court the pair had actually struck a ""gentleman's agreement"" for Platini to be paid a million Swiss francs a year.Both were accused of fraud and forgery of a document. Blatter was accused of misappropriation and criminal mismanagement, while Platini was accused of participating in those offences.The court concluded that fraud was ""not established with a likelihood bordering on certainty"", and therefore applied the general principle of criminal law according to which ""the doubt must benefit the accused""."

Three energy facilities were destroyed by the enemy today,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Wednesday night video address.""We are preparing for all kinds of scenarios in view of the winter season. We assume that Russian terror will be directed at energy facilities until, with the help of partners, we are able to shoot down 100 percent of enemy missiles and drones,"" said Zelenskiy, who earlier in the week said a third of his country's power stations had been hit by Russian air strikes.The mayor of the western city of Lviv said on television that it would take months to repair power substations that have been damaged.Ukraine had so far shot down a total of 233 Iranian-made drones used by Russia, including 21 on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said.Reuters witnesses said five drones hit the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv early on Thursday, but it was unclear where they had exploded or how much damage had been done.Ukraine accuses Russia of using Iran-made Shahed-136 ""kamikaze drones"", which fly to their target and detonate. Iran denies supplying them and the Kremlin also denied using them.The United States, Britain and France raised the issue of Iran's alleged transfer of drones to Russia at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.Russia will reassess its cooperation with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and his staff if Guterres sends experts to Ukraine to inspect downed drones that Ukraine and the West assert were made in Iran, Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy told reporters.In Kherson, the only regional capital Russian forces have captured since their invasion eight months ago, the Russian-appointed administration prepared an evacuation.Images of people using boats to flee the strategic southern city were broadcast by Russian state TV, which portrayed the exodus on the Dnipro river as an attempt to evacuate civilians before it became a combat zone. About 50,000 to 60,000 people would be moved out in the next six days, said Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed chief of Kherson.Staff at Kherson's Russian-backed administration were also being relocated to the eastern side of the Dnipro, Saldo said, although he said Russia had the resources to hold the city and even counter-attack if necessary.Kherson is arguably the most strategically important of four regions Russia claimed to have annexed in recent weeks. It controls both the only land route to the Crimea peninsula Russia seized in 2014, and the mouth of the Dnipro, the 2,200 km-long (1,367-mile) river that bisects Ukraine.In eastern Ukraine bordering Russia, Moscow's forces focused their main attempts to advance on the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a statement on Wednesday night.Bakhmut is the focus of Russia's slow advance through the Donetsk region. Forces trained tank and artillery fire on at least 10 towns in the area, including Bakhmut, Soledar and Bilohorivka, the Ukrainian statement said.Reuters was not able to verify battlefield reports.Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded an all-Russia war effort and declared martial law on Wednesday in areas of Ukraine occupied by his forces.A package of moves, including boosting the security powers of all of Russia's regional governors, was the latest intensification of the war by Putin to counter a series of major defeats at the hands of Ukrainian forces since the start of September.It was far from clear, however, how fast or how effectively the new measures might bolster Russia's military position on the ground. The U.S. State Department said Russia was resorting to ""desperate tactics"". A Ukrainian official said it would change nothing.Meanwhile, the United States imposed new sanctions on Russia, targeting a network that Washington accused of procuring military and dual-use technologies from U.S. manufacturers and supplying them to Russian users."
/news/bangladesh/transport/news/alarm-vehicle-fitness-clearance-7-year-low-3147216,Alarm as vehicle fitness clearance at 7-year low,"While registration of vehicles saw a sharp rise over the last fiscal year, the number of fitness clearances has dropped to a seven-year low, raising further concerns over road safety.At least 5.42 lakh registered vehicles have been operating on the roads  without the mandatory fitness clearance, which happened mainly due to poor monitoring by the authorities.Officials concerned said a rise in advance income tax amount from July 1, 2021, and the decision to give fitness clearances to only three types of private vehicles biennially, instead of annually, from January 2020, are major reasons behind the poor number of vehicles with fitness clearance.Apart from vehicles that have been registered but lack fitness clearance, there are thousands of unregistered vehicles whose fitness status is anyone'sguess.Unfit vehicles are one of the major reasons behind road crashes, due to which the number of lives lost is growing.At least 3,186 people were killed and 3,500 injured in 3,776 road crashes in the first eight months of this year, according to police reports.The numbers, however, were much lower than the estimates made by other non-government organisations.Till June this year, 52.92 lakh vehicles, mostly motorbikes, were registered with Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). Of them, 5.23 lakh got registered in last fiscal year, and 4.24 the fiscal before.All registered transport, except for motorcycles, are required to be cleared for fitness.However, new cars, SUVs and microbuses are not required to have it in the first five years. After that period, they need to get fitness clearances once in every two years.Only 5.64 lakh vehicles got fitness clearance in the last fiscal year, which is the lowest number since 2014-15, shows BRTA data.Even in 2020-21 when BRTA offices remained closed due to Covid-19 pandemic, the number of vehicles with fitness clearance was 6.75 lakh.A top BRTA official said the amount of advance income tax a vehicle owner has to pay for fitness clearance saw around 50 percent rise since July 1, 2021.He added the owner of a vehicle, between 1501cc to 2000cc, now has to pay Tk 50,000 now as AIT. The amount was Tk 30,000 before.""This may be a key reason for the sharp fall in the number of vehicles taking fitness clearance,"" he told this correspondent, seeking anonymity.Another BRTA official, preferring not to be named, said there are some types of vehicles, like human hauliers and trucks, whose owners have to bribe law enforcers and transport sector influentials even if they have fitness clearance. This discourages them to take any clearance test.He said cars, SUVs and microbuses had to take fitness clearances annually.Since January 2020, they have to take the clearance once in two years. The number of vehicles seeking the clearances has fallen due to this too.In this situation, the number of vehicles without fitness clearance is gradually increasing, shows BRTA data.Around 5.42 lakh registered vehicles, which are eligible for fitness test, did not renew their documents till October 15. The number was 5.08 lakh till January this year and 4.79 lakh till July 2019.However, the actual number of registered but unfit vehicles may not be that high because many of 5.42 vehicles may not be in operation anymore, another BRTA official said."

""We estimated how much oil will be needed in the upcoming days and made the proposal to the cabinet committee.""Replying to a query, he said, the figure might increase by next year and that prices would be fixed based on the S&P Platts' rate, before including the shipment costs, premium and so on.Bangladesh's transport sector is the main user of petroleum, accounting for 63 percent of the total annual consumption of oil, followed by irrigation, electricity generation, and the industrial sector, according to the BPC.Bangladesh uses roughly 65 lakh tonnes of petroleum annually and imported fuel accounts for 90 percent of the total requirement, according to BPC data.The rest is made up of gas produced locally."

/business/economy/news/fourth-industrial-revolution-and-our-financial-sector-3147386,Fourth industrial revolution and our financial sector,"It is very true that, with the passing of time, mankind has searched for new and better ways to live, and as a result, three industrial revolutions have taken place, drastically altering our way of life.  The fourth industrial revolution (4IR), which has arrived, is based on innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), digitalisation, robotics, augmented reality (AR), genome editing, 3d printing, and other fields.The financial sector of Bangladesh has already felt the considerable but varied effects of the 4IR. Blockchain, AI and other innovations have had an impact on the financial sector as well.THE IMPACT OF 4IR ON OUR FINANCIAL SECTOR4IR will have a major impact on the financial sector in Bangladesh. A complete transformation of banking and financial institution technology has resulted in more transactions being processed in a given time period and more services being provided.Properly implemented AI can make risk management easier and more effective. In addition, the combination of these technologies will allow us to perform better analytics, making forecasts easier and more accurate and we can provide services at low cost.Digital currency is one of the parts of the 4IR though the central bank of Bangladesh does not allow crypto trading as it violates the country's financial regulations. With many developed and developing countries recognising its potential, blockchain technology has become the future of the world in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.CHALLENGESThere are many challenges in our financial sector because of the 4IR. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of technical skills in developing countries like Bangladesh.Before embarking on the revolution, it is necessary to prepare a large number of skilled workers. The need for highly qualified workers is also increasing.Cybersecurity is the main concern of the financial sector. Since data is stored on servers, adequate security is required. Banks and financial institutions must, therefore, implement sufficiently secure systems before embracing the revolution.The 4IR poses a significant threat to unskilled and low-skilled workers who may lose their jobs as technology may replace them. Therefore, there is a need to create alternative employment opportunities.Young people are open to technologies and innovations. However, there are people in their 40s and 50s who do not want changes. When witnessing such tremendous changes in this field, they may not be ready to accept them immediately and some hurdles have been created.Competition among financial institutions in Bangladesh is fierce. Customers always expect better service, on-demand support, and more. However, it is true that the 4IR and its technologies can have not only negative but also positive impacts on society.Therefore, when deploying these new technologies, we must also prepare for adverse consequences. However, since the technology is still in its infancy, significant technical and regulatory risks and hurdles will need to be resolved before it can be widely adopted.The author is a researcher at the University of Bolton, UK  "
/news/bangladesh/news/independent-journalism-face-more-pressure-3147181,Independent journalism to  face more pressure  ,"The gazette declaring 29 government agencies and institutions as ""critical information infrastructure"" will create new pressure and obstacles in pursuing independent journalism, Sampadak Parishad (Editors' Council) has said.In a statement yesterday, the council voiced concerns over the gazette published in this regard, urging the authorities to remove ambiguities from it.Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Division made the declaration in line with section 15 of the Digital Security Act-2018 to safeguard ""sensitive"" information and data from cyberattacks, reads the statement.""Journalists' right to access to information has been hampered due to the declaration of the 29 government bodies as critical information infrastructure,"" reads the statement.Because of the issuance of the gazette, there will be no scope for getting information on any failure of the organisations concerned in providing services, the council said, adding this would pose a threat to independent journalism.At the same time, the gazette will encourage internal corruption, irregularities and a lack of accountability within the institutions concerned, it further says.The council issued the statement after a meeting on Tuesday.The authorities need to clarify the gazette declaring the 29 organisations as critical information infrastructure, since the Right to Information Act says access to information is a fundamental right, it noted. The organisations include the President's Office, the Prime Minister's Office, the National Board of Revenue, Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission, Bangladesh Bank, Bridges Division, immigration and passport department, national data centre, Bangladesh Computer Council, national identity card wing, the Election Commission Secretariat, Biman, Power Development Board, Titas gas company, and Bangabandhu satellite company.According to section 16(1) of the DSA, the director general of the digital security agency will visit, if necessary, the important information infrastructure from time to time to see if the rules of the law are being followed properly. Illegal entry to the important information infrastructure is a violation of the law and there is a provision for seven years' imprisonment or a fine of up to Tk 25 lakh or both.Harming or attempting to harm the infrastructure after entering it illegally can be punished by 14 years in prison or a fine of up to Tk 1 crore or both. A repeat offender can be punished by life imprisonment and a fine of no more than Tk 5 crore or both.The DSA is already obstructing social media, freedom of speech and free thinking. Journalists, legal experts, rights activists, representatives of the civil society, and multiple ministers and parliament members continue to make recommendations to change or revise the law.According to the DSA, critical information infrastructures are those that control, process, circulate or preserve any information, data or electronic information that if damaged or critically affected, may adversely affect public safety, financial security, public health, national security or national integrity, and sovereignty.Besides, the council earlier voiced concern over a move to amend the Press Council Law without stakeholders' suggestions.The meeting was presided over by its President and The Daily Star Editor and Publisher Mahfuz Anam. It was attended by Prothom Alo Editor Matiur Rahman, Manabzamin Editor Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, New Age Editor Nurul Kabir, Inqilab Editor AMM Bahauddin, Jugantor Editor Saiful Alam, The Financial Express Editor Shamsul Huq Zahid, Samakal acting editor Muzammil Husain, Desh Rupantor acting editor Mostafa Mamun, Sangbad Executive Editor Shahriar Karim, and the council's General Secretary and Bonik Barta Editor Dewan Hanif Mahmud.

/nrb/news/awami-league-leader-arrested-sent-jail-over-rape-us-3147996,"Awami League leader arrested, sent to jail over rape in US","A Massachusetts court in the US has arrested an Awami League leader in the US and sent him to jail on charges of raping an American black woman and strangulating her.The accused is Asif Ahmed Chowdhury aka Asif Babu (62), a resident of Medford near Boston and the vice-president of New England (Boston) Awami League. He is also former president of Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE) based in Boston, New England. He hails from Kattali village under Pahartali Police Station of Chattogram district.Judge Thomas Drechsler of the Superior Court of Salem City, Massachusetts on Friday, October 14, revoked Babu's bail on serious charges including rape and strangulation and arrested him pending sentencing before sending him to jail.Following the week-long judicial process, he was ordered to be remanded in custody. According to court sources, Asif Babu will be given the final sentence in the case on November 8.The incident of rape allegedly took place in September 2020.The victim, who has been living in the emergency shelter on Federal Street in Salem with her then 9-year-old daughter after she lost her job due to the pandemic and was unable to pay her rent, testified under questioning by prosecutor Kate MacDougall.While staying there, she searched for a place to live in Medford so her daughter could return to the school she was attending before the eviction, the woman testified, adding that she responded to an ad on Facebook Marketplace for a single room, placed by Chowdhury, and planned to take the room.Several days later, on September 17, 2020, Asif Babu visited the woman in Salem so she could sign a rental agreement. During that meeting is when the assault took place, the woman testified.The woman's daughter told jurors that she was awoken by the sounds of ""a lot of chaos"" and peeked out of the bedroom to see a man standing over her mother. ""She couldn't get up at all,"" the girl told jurors. She backed into the bedroom and called 911 emergency hotline.Salem Police Officer Jonathan Springer was the first to arrive at the shelter and found Asif Babu struggling with the woman near the door. He separated the two.Officer Keegan Stokes then arrived and spoke with the woman, who he said was crying hysterically. Stokes told jurors that he noticed that the kitchen of the shelter apartment was in disarray and found Asif Babu's glasses on the floor.Defense lawyers Syrie Fried and Benjamin Brooks sought to highlight inconsistencies in the woman's account to police, her testimony to a grand jury and her testimony at the trial, and pressed her with questions about Facebook Messenger exchanges in which Babu used heart emojis and paid her compliments.They also suggested the woman started the fight during a dispute over the amount of rent she would pay. ""You became angry and hit him,"" Fried suggested in a question. ""No,"" the woman responded.Fried showed the woman a photo of Asif Babu with scratches on his neck, and the ripped shirt he wore that night.""I was trying to get him off of me,"" the victim responded.Earlier, on November 9, 2019, during the biennial election of the Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE) in Boston, Asif Babu, a candidate for the president from one panel, and his associates beat up a candidate from a rival panel, leaving him seriously injured. When the help of the police was sought to control the situation, the police reached the spot and stopped the polling. Based on the said incident, Khoka-Nabi-Sami Parishad sports secretary candidate SM Sajjad Hossain filed a case against Asif Babu with the local police. A few weeks later, the case was settled with the intervention of some alleged community leaders in Boston.Despite allegations of widespread irregularities in that election, Asif Babu was elected president of the Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE) for a two-year term. This year, he appointed his wife Parvin Chowdhury as the president of BANE. Noman Sabit is a freelance journalist based in New York, US"

/shout/news/conversation-team-bangladesh-battle-minds-2022-3146021,In conversation with Team Bangladesh – Battle of Minds 2022,"Battle of Minds (BOM) started its journey in Bangladesh in 2004. It was created with the aim of bridging the gap between institutional education and the corporate world and has evolved into a global platform since 2018.In the 19th edition of BOM, after multiple rounds of ideation, teamwork, and resilience, ""Team Drogo"" from Institute of Business Administration (IBA), University of Dhaka came out victorious as the champions of the Bangladesh chapter. The team composed of Syed Shadab Tajwar, Tasmim Sultana Nawmi and Sadid Jubayer Murshed have already pitched their winning idea on October 18 in the Global Finale, where they represented Bangladesh amidst top 9 teams selected from the 25 countries that participated.In this interview with SHOUT, the champions tell us more about their experience throughout the competition.What motivated you to compete in BOM 2022?Sadid Jubayer Murshed: BOM has always been regarded as the most glamorous business competition around and we wanted to compete in it to bring out our best and win the trophy.Tasmim Sultana Nawmi: What piqued my interest was that BOM had activation rounds, where we had to showcase practical demonstrations of our idea. That challenge made me even more interested to do it.Syed Shadab Tajwar: As a business student who likes participating in competitions, BOM is a no brainer as it is the most prestigious competition. The concept of pitching your very own sustainable business idea to experts from the corporate world and the chance to get direct mentoring from them was too big an opportunity to pass on.When you first registered for the competition, did you think you would end up winning the title?Sadid: Our end goal was always to win. We thought we had a fairly good shot since we were seasoned in such competitions. This competition has had multiple winners from our institution in the past, so this strong culture of success motivated us throughout.Tasmim: Shabab and Sadid kept pushing me to believe we had what it took to win. So, we entered the competition with that mindset. With every stage we thought we have to give it our best to get to the next level.Shadab: We were always confident we had a solid idea, but our confidence grew as we went further. Each round gave us a taste of how real businesses work, we incorporated these learnings which made us feel like we had a genuine business to pitch.What was it like being in the competition and making it to the finals?Sadid: The finals were probably more nerve wracking for us since the director of our institution was going to be in attendance and we wanted to make him proud.Tasmim: Our experience started with the bootcamp, and those days were quite exciting, yet draining as we had to work through the rounds throughout the day. Once we got a hold of the idea and what we needed to do, things got easier. The highlight was probably the activation challenge we had to do in Savar. The scenario was completely different from what we had expected.Sadid: There were three broad challenges – governance, workplace digitisation in a post pandemic world and circular economy. We chose the ""circular economy"" category because we were more familiar with it. Our idea was to use textile waste and bamboo to make sanitary pads, since we observed a great need for it in the market. Even though we were aware that a lot of people would choose this category, we were confident that our product would stand out.Shadab: The final stage was one of the reasons why the journey was exciting for me. All eyes are on you and it's your turn to make it or break it.How do you think this competition gears students for the challenges of the business world?Shadab: The way the competition is designed, it actually prepared us in a lot of aspects. Firstly, if anyone wants to launch their business, this is a great place to gain hands-on experience. The bootcamp round in particular helps to understand how one can handle a brand through activations, focus group discussions etc.Sadid: Something I hadn't done before, even in other competitions, is bring out a product to reality. Especially for people like us who don't always have to interact with people on the ground and document their experiences.Tasmim: At every stage of the competition, I was speaking out more and getting more comfortable in my own element. I learned how to navigate through talking to people. Do you think it's feasible to implement this idea in real life?
Sadid: I think this is a feasible idea. This idea has tremendous impact in the context of Bangladesh, because not only are we helping the environment by reducing plastic waste, but we would also be introducing a sanitary pad that is backed by research and is safe for women.
Tasmim: When we conducted focus group discussions with women aged between 18 and 26, we found some common problems they were facing, like rashes or itchiness. We designed our product keeping in consideration the concerns they had, which made it far more formidable.
Finally, how have the last few months been after winning the competition? What does it feel like to represent Bangladesh on a global stage?
Shadab: The past few months have been a roller coaster ride. While the feeling of being BOM Champion is unmatched, the task of representing Bangladesh is something we are taking very seriously.
Tasmim: The first few months after winning were filled with excitement. But we also prepared extensively for the global round. We have worked on making our pitch as clear as possible for the global round judges and are excited to present it.
Sadid: We have constantly been refining our ideas and diving into the minutiae of execution. We are thoroughly well prepared for our global finals and excited to present our vision to the whole world.
A message from Saad Jashim, Head of Human Resources, BAT Bangladesh: 
What truly makes BOM a journey to remember is the opportunity it offers by getting graduates to roll up their sleeves and get hands on experience. We dream bigger and bigger each year. By keeping ourselves contemporary, we ensure the most experiential journey for our participants.

/environment/natural-resources/energy/news/gas-crisis-no-end-plight-anytime-soon-3147166,Gas Crisis: No end to plight anytime soon,"""Our production has dropped by 55 percent, and we don't know when the situation will return to normal. We are at risk of losing our buyers."" Md Khorshed Alam Chairman of Ashulia-based Little Star Spinning Mills Ltd
The acute gas crisis, which has been plaguing the industrial sector and households, is unlikely to see a drastic improvement anytime soon.
A part of the transport sector that heavily depends on gas has also been hit hard with the filling stations struggling to supply gas to CNG-run vehicles.  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Officials put it down to a huge gap between the supply and demand for gas.
The situation started getting worse in July when the government decided to stop purchase of liquified natural gas (LNG) from the international spot market due to a massive price hike.



It forced the authorities to ration the available gas to domestic and commercial consumers.
On October 16, state-run Petrobangla could supply 2,621 million cubic feet (mmcf) of gas per day to the national grid against a demand for 3,760 mmcf. The average shortfall in gas supply has been around 1,000 mmcf per day over the last few months, according to its production data.
Meanwhile, the arbitrary rationing has aggravated the sufferings.



Take, for instance, the plight of Jummatul Bida, a domestic gas user, in the capital's Gandaria area.
""For the last two months, we are not getting any gas from 8:00am till 7:00pm. I have to wake up at 5:00am to prepare breakfast as well as lunch before the gas supply stops,"" said Bida.
She further said the crisis has upset her daily routine such as taking her children to school on time.
""If I can't get up very early in the morning, we either have to starve or buy food from restaurants.""
Not only Bida, many others in in the city's Mohammadpur, Kazipara, Shewrapara, Jigatola, Banasree, Badda, Postogola, Hazaribagh, Keraniganj, Gazipur, Savar and Manikganj have complained of acute gas crisis.
The power sector that consumes 42 percent of the total gas supply had to reduce power production at around 30 gas-fired plants due to the gas crisis in July.
As power production at gas-fired plants has fallen to 5,000-5,500MW from 11,162MW per day, load-shedding across the country, according to Bangladesh Power Development Board data, has gone up to six hours a day.
INDUSTRIES SUFFER
Production at Little Star, a spinning mill in Ashulia, has slumped by more than half from its daily capacity of 12 tonnes of yarn due to the gas crisis for the last three months.
""Our production has dropped by 55 percent and we don't know when the situation will return to normal. We are at risk of losing our buyers,"" Md Khorshed Alam, chairman of Ashulia-based Little Star Spinning Mills Ltd, told this newspaper.
He said they have two spinning mills -- one in Ashulia and the other in Bhulta. Gas is needed to run the boilers of both mills for dyeing and printing fabrics.
""The Bhulta factory was hit by the gas crisis one and a half months ago ... At times, gas pressure falls so much so that the machines shut down.
""Sometimes, it takes four to five hours to get the required gas pressure again to resume production. If this crisis persists for long, it will be difficult to keep the business afloat,"" he added.
According to Bangladesh Ceramic Manufacturers & Exporters Association (BCMEA), the industry has seen a fall in production by 10 to 30 percent due to the ongoing crisis of gas.
""We need gas for a burner to produce ceramic products. The gas crisis is hampering our production. Besides, most of the goods inside a burner get damaged if there is a sudden fall in gas pressure,"" said Irfan Uddin, Director of FARR Ceramic Ltd.
""We are falling behind schedule and also losing many orders from foreign buyers due to the disruption in gas supply.""
Irfan said three of the six burners in his tiles factory in Gazipur remain shut due to the gas shortage.
Taslim Shahriar, senior assistant general manager of the Meghna Group of Industries, said production of consumer goods in their factories in Narayanganj has dropped by 50 percent due to the gas crisis.
SHORTAGE OF CNG SUPPLY
The government, as part of gas rationing, shut all CNG stations for four hours a day in September last year. The shutdown has been extended by another hour since March this year.
Farhan Noor, general secretary of Bangladesh CNG Filling Station and Conversion Workshop Owners Association, said the government decision to shut the pumps for five hours hurt the businesses badly.
""Besides, the filling stations are not getting sufficient gas pressure,"" he said.
The situation has gone from bad to worse despite the government's assurance that things would improve in three months, he added.
The gas crisis has also affected fertiliser production, as three of the four state-run urea fertiliser factories have remained shut since the last week of June.
In September, farmers staged demonstrations in Jamalpur, Rangpur and several other districts, demanding uninterrupted supply of fertiliser.
The government, however, gave assurances several times that there would be no shortage of fertiliser in the coming days, as it has enough stocks and already signed deals with several countries to import fertilisers.
WAIT TILL WINTER
Petrobangla Chairman Nazmul Ahsan said there has been 10 percent shortfall in gas supply to the national grid since the government stopped importing LNG from the spot market due to its massive price hike in the global market.
""The whole world is in a crisis right now. We will have to work together to get out of this,"" Ahsan told The Daily Star.
He, however, hoped the situation would improve in the coming winter.
""The demand for electricity will fall in the winter. Besides, some coal-based power plants will come into operation by the end of this year,"" he said, adding that it would allow them to reduce production in some gas-based power plants and supply more gas to the industries and other sectors.
In reply to a query, he said the existing system doesn't give them the option for letting the consumers know in advance about the gas supply situation like the schedule for load-shedding.
""Our production has dropped by 55 percent, and we don't know when the situation will return to normal. We are at risk of losing our buyers."" The acute gas crisis, which has been plaguing the industrial sector and households, is unlikely to see a drastic improvement anytime soon.
A part of the transport sector that heavily depends on gas has also been hit hard with the filling stations struggling to supply gas to CNG-run vehicles.  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Officials put it down to a huge gap between the supply and demand for gas.
The situation started getting worse in July when the government decided to stop purchase of liquified natural gas (LNG) from the international spot market due to a massive price hike.



It forced the authorities to ration the available gas to domestic and commercial consumers.
On October 16, state-run Petrobangla could supply 2,621 million cubic feet (mmcf) of gas per day to the national grid against a demand for 3,760 mmcf. The average shortfall in gas supply has been around 1,000 mmcf per day over the last few months, according to its production data.
Meanwhile, the arbitrary rationing has aggravated the sufferings.



Take, for instance, the plight of Jummatul Bida, a domestic gas user, in the capital's Gandaria area.
""For the last two months, we are not getting any gas from 8:00am till 7:00pm. I have to wake up at 5:00am to prepare breakfast as well as lunch before the gas supply stops,"" said Bida.
She further said the crisis has upset her daily routine such as taking her children to school on time.
""If I can't get up very early in the morning, we either have to starve or buy food from restaurants.""

A thief has called police seeking help.Police today (October 20, 2022) said they received a call from a thief to save him from possible mob beating as he was stranded inside a shop in Barishal town after committing theft.Yeasin Khan, 41, entered a shop in AR Khan Bazar area of Sadar upazila and got stuck inside the shop on Wednesday morning after sensing presence of people in the market, said Asaduzzaman, officer-in-charge (OC) of Metropolitan Bandar police station.The man called 999 for help fearing that he might be beaten up by the locals if caught, the OC added.When police asked him why he is not coming out of the shop, Yeasin told them that it took him a long time to pack the stolen goods and when he completed it is already morning and people started gathering in the market.""In this condition, if Yeasin came out, he would be beaten up by the mob,"" said OC Asaduzzaman.Shop owner Jhantu said he did not know that a thief entered his shop and packed goods in his bag.Later, police arrested Yeasin from the spot after rescuing him from the shop, said the OC."

We will be seeing how the dismissal of Roe v. Wade will impact projects and lives in Bangladesh for a long time to come.We chose this topic for the October 19 online reading of Sister Library because we felt that we were in a safe enough position to.We have spoken to several group owners who have experienced mysterious moderation from Meta/ Facebook of posts related to abortion. One such group is a women's only support group where members can ask anonymous questions. The 'disappearance' of information on safe abortions, after care, health issues related to abortion, is strange, unaccounted for, and dangerous.According to a study funded by WHO, almost 90 percent of abortions in countries with liberal abortion laws are considered safe, compared with just 25 percent of abortions in countries where abortion is banned, or permited under certain circumstances. This does not take into account the suicide deaths that are caused by fear or lack of after-care.For women looking for answers in Bangladesh, the choice is meagre. Abortion is not legal, but menstrual regulation is. You will face questions about your marital status. You might be turned away if the status is not right. You might be turned away without your husband. If you make it past the screening and get the procedure, don't wait for aftercare. Don't expect support. Go home. Don't tell anyone.Lucy Burns, the author of Larger Than An Orange (Penguin, 2021), captures the physical, mental and spiritual impact of an abortion on her, which lasted over two years. Her painful diary is speckled with compulsive-obsessive behaviour and self-destruction. It is a very hard read, and Sister Library will only be reading parts to illustrate how difficult this experience is, even in countries where there are robust medical systems, free mental health care and acceptance of female sexuality.The reading, led by Shaveena Anam and Syeda Samara Mortada, is an effort to support female autonomy and safety.Syeda Samara Mortada is a feminist activist, and a SRHR expert currently working as the partner-Coordinator of Bonhishkha, a feminist organisation in Bangladesh that works towards achieving equality of genders. Shaveena Anam is a feminist, facilitator and trainer, currently working with Acumen Academy Bangladesh. We hope to create a resource bank in Bangla of links, articles and references to support women as they face the decision, make the choice and recover from it.Katerina Don is the curator of HerStory Foundation."

Less than 14 percent experienced an increase, while for 10 percent, it remained the same.Around 57.8 percent of the respondents saw a decrease in funds provided by international development partners, while 37.3 percent experienced declining funds from the government, and 33.7 percent witnessed a decrease in philanthropic funds.Among the top three areas for which funds have decreased, 45.8 percent of funds decreased in poverty alleviation, 22.9 percent in quality education and 20.5 percent in gender equality.Only 2 percent of the CSOs experienced no impacts of decreased funding, while some 65.10 percent had to cut down their workforce; 47 percent shut down their operations, and 42.20 percent had to reduce the salary of their workforce.Only 20 percent of the surveyed NGOs faced no difficulty in obtaining funding from the government and its agencies.Around 66.19 percent of CSOs had to go through a cumbersome process of attaining funds, while 39.4 percent had to face competition for limited funding from similar organisations, and 29.4 percent reported discriminations in funding.While presenting the findings of the study, Debapriya Bhattacharya, convenor of Citizen's Platform for SDGs, said the government should prepare a comprehensive strategy document on the role of the civil society for smooth and sustainable LDC graduation.Farah Kabir, country director of ActionAid Bangladesh, suggested reducing dependency on foreign funds for running CSOs.While moderating the discussion, Shaheen Anam, core group member of Citizen's Platform, said fund inflow to small NGOs has been declining gradually.Shaheen Anam, also executive director of Manusher Jonno Foundation (MJF), said MJF had to stop funding 120 small NGOs, while many small CSOs are about to shut down for lack of funding.Nazneen Ahmed, country economist for Bangladesh, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), suggested a long transition policy for CSOs and NGOs up to 2041 to overcome the middle-income trap after LDC graduation in 2026.Khushi Kabir, member of the board of trustees of Centre for Policy Dialogue; Badiul Alam Majumdar, member secretary to Shujan; Md Abdus Shahid, chairman of Committee on Estimates in Bangladesh Parliament; Nesar Ahmed, international trade expert of the finance ministry; Hosne Ara Hasi, chief executive of Jago Nari; and Md Shahid Uz Zaman, founder and executive director of Eco-Social Development Organisation, spoke at the event among others."

/business/economy/news/rescheduled-loans-too-turning-bad-3147416,Rescheduled loans too turning bad,"The Bangladesh Bank's policy that allows defaulters longer repayment tenures and easy terms and access to fresh funds has appeared to have failed to make major inroad in bringing down bad debts as rescheduled loans are even turning sour. In 2019, the central bank issued a relaxed policy on loan rescheduling and offered a one-time exit policy to address the long-standing issue of bad debts.Under the facility, clients can regularise defaulted loans by repaying a lower amount of their NPLs as a down payment than usually required.As a result, the amount of rescheduled loans swelled: a record Tk 52,770 crore was rescheduled in the year.Banks regularised defaulted loans to the tune of Tk 12,380 crore in 2021, of which 19.8 per cent has slipped into the bad loan category once again, data from the central bank showed.The ratio of defaulted rescheduled loans stood at 18 per cent in 2020 when lenders collectively regularised NPLs of Tk 13,470 crore.In December last year, defaulted loans in the banking sector totalled Tk 103,274 crore, which was 7.93 per cent of the outstanding loans.Anis A Khan, a former managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, says the upward trend of the defaulted rescheduled loans is not a good sign for the banking sector as willful defaulters usually misuse the facility.In July, the central bank relaxed the rules related to loan rescheduling to a large degree.Under the new policy, defaulters who took term loans are now allowed to pay back the funds in six to eight years compared to the previous tenure of nine to 24 months.Term loans, which are repaid in more than one year, are usually given out to businesses to set up new industrial units and expand the existing ones.Besides, defaulters are now permitted to give only 2.5-6.5 per cent of their NPLs as the down payment instead of the previous 10-30 per cent.Before July, defaulters had to pay up to 30 per cent of their NPLs down to reschedule bad loans. In many cases, habitual defaulters had their loans rescheduled by making a lower down payment than the requirement with prior approval of the central bank.And after becoming a regular borrower, the willful defaulters had taken on new loans from several banks, but they did not repay the funds later, sending the volume of the classified loans in the banking sector higher.""The relaxed policy did not bring any good for the banking sector. Rather, it has weakened the financial health of many banks,"" Khan said.He urged banks not to extend any rescheduling facility to delinquent borrowers and said such clients rather should be brought to book in order to restore governance in the banking sector.""The new policy will weaken the health of banks further,"" Khan warned, adding that banks should serve legal notices to the willful defaulters and file lawsuits against them in order to recover funds.Rescheduled loans are considered stress assets as banks generally face difficulties in recouping them.Many weak borrowers don't make sincere efforts to improve the condition of their businesses despite securing easy repayment terms and accessing fresh funds.""This makes them defaulters once again,"" said Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank.Some banks rescheduled defaulted loans by relaxing rules and regulations during the coronavirus pandemic since the business slowdown hit borrowers hard.""But many of the borrowers have recently become defaulters. So, the ratio of the defaulted rescheduled loans might have increased last year,"" said Emranul Huq, managing director of Dhaka Bank.According to a paper of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, NPLs are a burden for both lenders and borrowers, contract credit supply, distort the allocation of credit, worsen market confidence, and slow economic growth.""The economies that actively seek to resolve NPLs do comparably well,"" it said.  "
/shout/news/open-space-final-frontier-3147061,Open Space: A final frontier?,"II spent my formative years in Jahangirnagar and Cambridge University where I took space for granted. In both these university towns, there were pockets where I could escape and watch life pass by. Or I could just gaze up to the heavens asking: is there anything out there? Or I could hum the lyrics of songs or compose couplets of poems.There were green fields and water bodies. There were trees where birds would sing, or squirrels run up during the day. At night, owls would look with wise eyes. I could tell the change of seasons simply by smelling the air. Be it rain, sun, clouds, or snow, I was always close to nature. Open space shaped my inner soul. Sadly, our happiness never lasts forever.In August 1998, my father completed his tenure as the Vice Chancellor of Jahangirnagar University. That month we moved back to our homestead in Dhaka at New Elephant Road. I was abroad at the time, but I didn't entertain the thought of settling in Dhaka. To this very day, I still don't.IIDhaka officially became a mega-city in 2000, passing a population of 10 million (1 crore). Today, Dhaka is the second most populous city in South Asia, behind only Delhi. This population has no logical reason to reduce in the foreseeable future. There will be tremendous competition for space. History suggests, policy makers will focus on housing and transport infrastructures. Sadly, they will probably not focus on open space. Less open space will be available as fields or parks. Waterbodies will be filled to meet housing or transport demand. Gardens and roadside trees will turn to grey concrete or black pitch.Open space is a neglected dimension of exterior and interior architecture in Dhaka. This was never the case with Dhaka. If you look at Mughal architecture, you will see and feel the concept of (open) space within and outside buildings. The Mughals constructed their cities and buildings based on open space. Dhaka was like that in the past. It no longer is.III
I don't foresee Dhaka accommodating open space soon. So, I try to make the best of what I can do. I go to Dhaka University, which is within walking and cycling distance from my house. I love the open space there. Having grown up in open spaces, I now appreciate the access to the free open space of Dhaka University, BUET and Dhaka Medical College campuses.
I'm no longer young enough to find a private tree for myself. However, I'm not too old that while I'm in this open space, I can't watch life pass me by in a city where I live, not because I love it, but because I have no other choice.

Anisur stopped speaking after the DCs raised a ruckus at the meeting.Addressing the event yesterday, former chief election commissioner Justice Abdur Rouf said, ""If the national election is held with a political government in power, the DCs and SPs would follow the instructions of the government, not the commission.""Immediate past CEC KM Nurul Huda said the gap between the EC and the DCs and SPs should be removed, according to meeting sources.The statement that the DCs and SPs don't listen to the EC is not correct, he added.Former commissioner Brigadier General M Sakhawat Hussain (retired) told reporters that he suggested installation of CCTV cameras at polling centres instead of purchasing EVMs in order to hold free and fair elections.""It's very easy to find out even if ballots are stolen. You have a voter list with photos. What you have seen in the EVM is delicate manipulation.""According to meeting sources, another former election commissioner Kabita Khanam said a fair election is not possible without coordination with the field-level administration.Ex-commissioner Shah Nawaz said the manner in which the DCs behaved in the recent meeting with the EC is ""not desirable"".Former EC secretary Helaluddin Ahmed said, ""It will be difficult for the EC to handle a situation if persons other than DCs are made returning officers in the parliamentary election.""Speaking to The Daily Star, ex-EC secretary Muhammed Sadique said the DCs and SPs are team members who hold an election smoothly. ""It will be difficult for the EC to hold a better election unless the teamwork clicks.""CEC Kazi Habibul Awal told The Daily Star said that they would look into coordination with the field-level officials.Former commissioner Sakhawat Hussain told this newspaper that he recommended the commission rethink its decision of using EVMs in maximum 150 parliamentary seats in the national election."

In several ways, they are mirror images of each other.For years afterwards, Johnson turned down offers to play a superhero as his eyes were fixed on his passion project.The wrestler-turned-actor and producer later grew to believe each character deserved a standalone origin story.He fought to hive off Black Adam from the Shazam project. In a tweet, he said a solo movie would prevent his character's ""ruthless, violent tone"" from being diluted by the sunny, comedic slant of the Shazam movie.Johnson's campaigning worked.Shazam, played by Zachary Levi, went on to be the focus of the self-titled solo movie in 2019, with a sequel, Shazam! Fury Of The Gods, coming in 2023.Johnson has confirmed that Adam and Shazam will meet in a future project.But do not hold your breath if you are hoping for a Batman-Black Adam crossover.Given the current fractured state of the DCEU, it is not known if the Justice Society of America or Black Adam will connect with other DC characters, even though in lore at least, they all live in a connected multiverse. "

These handles, which will exist alongside the YouTube channel name, will be a new way for YouTube users to mention and interact with each other. According to YouTube, every channel will have a unique handle - which will be especially helpful for content creators as they can be mentioned by their fans in community posts or comments using these handles. Essentially, this will be the same as how the 'tagging' and 'mentioning' function works on Facebook and Twitter, but using handle names instead of the full channel name. Users are already receiving email which notifies that the handle feature is being released. YouTube states that those who have received the first mail will receive another email and a notification in YouTube Studio, after which the user can choose their own unique YouTube handle name. If your YouTube channel already has a personalised URL, YouTube will be reserving the name in that URL as the automatic handle. Users will be able to change that reserved handle if they wish. Even if your YouTube channel doesn't have a personalised URL, you can still choose a handle for your channel when the feature is released for everyone. If you already didn't have a personalised URL for your channel., YouTube will also create a personalised URL as well when you create your handle.According to YouTube, if you haven't selected a handle for your YouTube channel by November 14, 2022, you will be automatically assigned a handle. You will still be able to change that automatic handle in YouTube Studio anytime later."
/shout/news/why-we-dystopian-novels-so-much-3145976,Why we like dystopian novels so much,"1984, Fahrenheit 451, A Brave New World, The Handmaid's Tale, Divergent, and Animal Farm are titles most highlighted on the internet when discussing novels. From tweets and Tumblr posts, to Instagram bios on edgy kids' profiles, dystopian novels have gained notoriety within readers and non-readers alike for being juggernauts of social commentary.Surveillance states, totalitarian regimes, environmental catastrophes, mass poverty, and oppression are a few of the usual key elements that make up a formulaic dystopian novel. The plots usually take place in a post-apocalyptic world with an antagonistic government holding too much power over the civilians, and a driven protagonist who actively challenges authority.Recently, this new wave of obsession with dystopian novels took the world by storm. Reading about oppressive systems became tantamount to being a ""woke"" individual. Soon enough, people started comparing real-world situations to those in the novel. Since references from these novels keep popping up as literary or cultural references all the time, people start reading them out of fear of missing out.In 2013, The New Yorker published an article titled So Are We Living in 1984?, highlighting the massive power the NSA holds over USA's citizens by collecting data and maintaining constant surveillance. Novels like these spark conversation amongst people about the road society is taking, and with that, we fear whether these novels are mere warnings or prophecies. So, why DO we gravitate towards pessimistic depictions of the future so much?One feature of dystopian novels that makes them so compelling is the portrayal of real-world problems in an exaggerated manner. The Handmaid's Tale gives us foresight on the horror that follows abortion bans and forced births, something a lot of right-wing conservatives down play as not-so-bad side effects. Similarly, Fahrenheit 451 showcases the harm of censorship and forced ignorance, which is exemplified in the United States banning books on gender, race, and sexuality in 2022.Another key factor that attracts readers, particularly teenagers, is the rebellious nature of the protagonist. We love to see ourselves in them: staunch, courageous, convicted, and contrarian. Teenagers live vicariously through these characters, and the authoritative antagonists of these stores often act as an analogy to authority in their lives, i.e. parents, teachers, etc. In fact, one of the reasons why generation Z is more ready to fight the power and lead the charge than any other generation is because they have been fed a steady diet of dystopian novels. Ironically, dystopian novels provide hope for the future, since we learn to recognise oppressive patterns and giveaways in the real world from these books. This allows us to draw parallels from the book to the lives we lead.Dystopia helps us understand, identify and empathise with social evils better. Being familiar with dystopia makes us feel socially and intellectually aware. While the thrill we get from reading about post-societal worlds is gratifying in and of itself, learning to actually absorb the lessons and signs the authors tried to warn us about is something we should not forget to do whilst we're submerged in these fictional worlds of ash, dust, and bone.Koushin Unber is worried about losing her childlike wonder.

/shout/news/what-students-can-expect-major-architecture-3147036,What students can expect from a major in Architecture,"""Drawing, colours, paint, and art fascinated me from a young age. I studied science during my O and A-levels hoping to pursue a medical degree. However, I have been intrigued by architecture since the sixth grade. Being the perfect amalgamation of art and science, this choice came very naturally to me,"" says Nuzhat Shama, a Research Assistant at the Center for Inclusive Architecture and Urbanism, BRAC University, and an Executive Architect at Interform Studio RANCON.Like Nuzhat, many out there are captivated by the field of architecture and all that it has to offer in terms of academics and as a career. What most of these aspirants do not know, however, is that architecture is a lot more than just drawing buildings and designing interiors. Thus, it is a major that many want to enrol in, but only few are aware of what to truly expect from it.One of the first things you will notice when enrolling in a Bachelor of Architecture program is that the number of credit hours needed for this degree is significantly higher than most other undergraduate programs. Where most undergrad degrees require somewhere between 130 to 160 credits, you have to complete around 200 credits for a B.Arch. degree, but there is good reason for that.""Building and structure design is the art and science of architecture. The understanding of physics, engineering, and mathematics is needed to produce designs that are both aesthetically beautiful and structurally sound. For developing comprehensive plans for entire cities and regions, many architects also collaborate with landscape architects, interior designers, and urban planners. So, we also need to learn the basics of landscaping, interior designing and urban planning. Thus comes the need for so many courses and therefore, so many credit hours,"" says Pantha Shahriar, an Associate Architect at Triangle Consultants.""Project management is also something we must learn about,"" adds Pantha. ""Architects are the ones overseeing entire projects these days including costs and materials. We also have to learn the basics of electrical connections and plumbing that run inside the structures we design, making the curriculum more extensive.""The architecture curriculum often consists of courses covering topics like history, art, music, environment and ecosystem, etc. For someone with little to no idea about the curriculum, this may come as a surprise. They might even think that these courses are unnecessary and are only adding to the burden of completing the already huge curriculum. Of course, that's not the case. These courses are vital for anyone studying architecture as Nuzhat explains.""When you are an architect, you are responsible for creating the environment which shapes human beings including their habits, mindsets, cultures, lives, leisure, memories, and so on,"" says Nuzhat.""You are essentially directing their destinies. Architecture continues to contribute to city skylines and entire urban landscapes. Tunnel vision leads to projects which are bound to fail eventually. Objectivity and critical thinking are of utmost importance. An architect needs to be a well-rounded professional, which is why such courses are so important and contribute so much to the making of an architect.""Then there are the classes themselves. Apart from the typical theory and lab courses, architecture students also have to attend studio courses.""Studio courses are extremely unconventional by nature,"" Nuzhat explains. ""You apply learned-knowledge in the studio during the course of five years. You are encouraged to treat the studio as your own home. You can picture it as a workshop with flickering lights from desktop PCs, cutting mats, NT cutters, papers, and countless other materials strewn everywhere.""Lectures and lessons aren't confined to just classrooms and studios. Architecture students often have to go on site-visits to explore various types of architecture. From historical monuments to modern residential buildings, these students take these trips to get a better understanding of how practicality comes into play when bringing an architectural design to life.On top of that, architecture students these days also have to focus on sustainability and how to ensure it in their work, which they also get to understand through taking field trips and more importantly, through completing an abundance of projects during their undergrad life. Perhaps the biggest project and challenge they take on is their undergrad thesis.Working on your undergrad thesis is a daunting experience irrespective of your field of study. In the case of architecture students, however, the experience is a lot more unpleasant.""What makes our thesis defence so nerve wracking is definitely the sheer volume of work,"" says Nuzhat.""Every single line you draw has to be done deliberately. Every millimetre of material has to be taken into consideration. It is normalised to create and lead teams of juniors and/or seniors to help you out with the workload. From my experience, I had my team working on the project over the course of three months at my place.""""During the last month, we were pulling in 12-16 hours of work,"" adds Nuzhat. ""We had to finish drawing the building blueprints, buying materials, distributing workloads, post processing imagery, creating videos, composing sheets, and building the physical models during this time.""The thesis project runs alongside multiple other projects and models that these students have to work on. What this does is increase the pressure on architecture students as well as drive up the costs they need to bear.""Besides the tuition fees, there are some hidden costs in studying architecture that many are unaware of,"" says Pantha.""Majority of the cost is generated from the materials for the models, but there are other significant investments an architecture student may need to make, like buying a high-end PC for visualisation, 3D modelling, rendering, and animation. Expensive and rare stationery items for hand drawing, drafting, and graphical rendering are also necessary. Moreover, there is a significant amount of cost generated from sheet printing for architectural jury and presentations.""The difficulties don't end there. There is nothing conventional about the way Architecture is taught. Normally, for most undergrad courses, you study for a course, attend a few lab classes, and give exams – that's not the case here. Architecture is somewhat of a lifestyle. The abnormal workload is also something you have to deal with and eventually normalise if you want to continue studying in this field. Nuzhat's advice for those looking to study architecture sums up the whole experience perfectly.""If you love yourself, don't study architecture,"" she says.

/opinion/views/news/want-save-biodiversity-look-locally-led-approaches-3147516,Want to save biodiversity? Look to locally-led approaches,"There is overwhelming evidence by now that climate change and biodiversity losses have already put the lives and livelihood of the world's population at serious risk. Scientists and practitioners are working hard to tackle these challenges and advocating for a combined approach of legal and social interventions. Rightly so, they often call for revising policies and regulations to prevent climate- and biodiversity-adverse activities from a legal perspective. At the same time, they suggest employing a community-focused approach to halt the ongoing climate and biodiversity degradation by involving local communities thought to be responsible for the problem. Such a holistic approach has gained significant momentum in tackling manufactured environmental disasters worldwide, including in Bangladesh. Unsurprisingly, policy dialogues and community-focused interventions remain central to most of Bangladesh's recently completed, ongoing, or forthcoming biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation projects. However, while the community-focused approach often meets with success in the short term, the sustainability of such success remains questionable and thus needs serious rethinking.To understand the problem, let me clarify that the traditional idea of community-focused biodiversity conservation or climate change adaptation relies on two simple assumptions. First, external government or non-government agencies will motivate, train, and provide initial logistics for climate change adaptation or biodiversity-friendly activities to the local communities. Second, local communities will continue the suggested practice after the external support is renounced. The idea is elegant. So, different national and international NGOs picked it up quickly and started implementing community-focused conservation and adaptation projects throughout Bangladesh from the early 90s.As the practice has been taking place for about 30-plus years, we can now look at some old project sites. Unfortunately, we may discover that what has been hailed as a successful intervention in the short term can no longer be treated as successful. Local communities often abandon the suggested activities soon after the project support ends. But why so? Perhaps, the problem lies in how we plan and implement a community-focused project. Matching biodiversity conservation or climate change adaptation activities in line with the local community's preferences and culture are well-known challenges. Whether the scheduled activities offer short-term livelihood benefits to the local community also matters. Although planners draw from their experience or consult the locals to determine conservation or adaptation interventions, the local community's livelihood interests, preferences, and culture are rarely considered fully. As a result, local communities rarely own the project and discontinue the suggested activities.Project evaluation fails to identify this discrepancy because assessment is usually conducted at the final stage of a project when external support is still in place. Such a problem is not limited to any particular area or implementing organisation; it is widespread, and we must address it.One way to address this problem is to apply a local community-led approach, popularly known as the ""locally-led approach (LLA)."" Although the concept of LLA is often discussed for climate change adaptation, the idea is equally applicable to biodiversity conservation. Nevertheless, the LLA is community-focused but differs from our traditional practice in several ways. For example, external agencies play a prominent role in the conventional community-focused approach. In contrast, the local community plays a central role in the LLA. As the term ""locally-led"" implies, the local community's preferences, culture, and livelihood benefits are considered, and the community owns the project. So, the LLA can potentially overcome the common problems of our traditional conservation and adaptation interventions and may succeed in the long run. The floating vegetable garden in central Bangladesh and the community-led dam-building and mangrove-planting in southwestern coastal areas are examples of locally-led climate adaptation and biodiversity conservation.Most of those ideas are championed by respective local communities. Subsequent projects in those areas extended the age-old practice and showed promising results. However, we must note that any successful intervention in one place may not be successful everywhere. For example, the locally-led floating vegetation garden idea is effective in central Bangladesh, but we cannot be sure that the coastal communities would equally prefer the concept. So, project planners should better consider the situation-specific locally-led approach.That being said, complications could arise depending on the property rights/land tenure issue. Most often, community-focused approaches are suitable for government or community-owned land. However, individual preference matters most if the conservation and adaptation project targets an individual's land. In such a scenario, an individual-focused conservation or adaptation project is perhaps most suitable. Although many projects rent individual land and set up community-focused interventions, the strategy usually fails at the end of the project and should be avoided. Instead, the success of the individual-focused approach followed by the Department of Agriculture Extension in promoting agriculture and horticulture crops can be streamlined in climate change adaptation and biodiversity conservation. Brac recently piloted such an idea of individual-focused intervention under the ""My Forest"" project in Bagerhat and Patuakhali. Although the intervention shows initial promise, its long-term performance can be monitored.Meanwhile, our traditional approach may still be helpful if the project is implemented on government land and proper monitoring and logistical support continue for a long period of time. The social forestry programme of the forest department in Bangladesh is such an example, and the programme is successful in achieving its overarching goal of reducing deforestation. However, we may not call the social forest programme a genuinely community-focused approach, but a participatory approach.To conclude, community-focused biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation strategies have been widely employed in Bangladesh for quite a long time. Still, most methods do not seem as sustainable as expected. So, we must recognise the problem in the first place and then find what is going wrong. We also need to understand the fine line separating the recently advocated locally-led approach from the traditional one. Then, depending on the context, we may go for a locally-led or an individual-focused method to ensure the sustainability of our biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation interventions. Only this way can we build a climate-resilient, biologically diverse, and green Bangladesh, wherein we can live and prosper in harmony with nature. Dr Shekhar R Biswas is a professor of ecology at East China Normal University in Shanghai.

/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/the-return-90s-makeup-3147736,The return of 90s makeup,"For many of us, the 90s symbolised the best of everything — the best creative content, the most beautiful icons, and the daring makeup trends. It was a time of unmatched energy and it gave makeup icons such as Bobbi Brown, Pat McGrath, and Pati Dubroff the perfect springboards to launch their careers. Dubroff continues to reign supreme and as films and TV shows like Pam & Tommy and Spencer, as well as a modern spin on the decade's trends in euphoria brings fresh nostalgic pangs for the 90s, here are some of the 90's most iconic makeup trends, that have been tweaked by the artist to sneak into your looks now.The 90s was the time of dramatically structured and squared brows. Then came the time of almost no brows and then it was the thinnest of lines that ruled the game. Dubroff mentions that one must adopt the current style and keep it looking natural. She suggests filling the eyebrows with a thin pencil and then setting it with a pigmented brow gel on the hairs, rather than the skin beneath.Even if warm, nude tones are in now, it was the cooler tones, especially blue and pastel shades that made up the classic 90s eye. While traditional shades like the 90s browns and taupes are still firm favourites, icy blues and pale greys can be slightly tricky to pull off. The makeup maestro has a way out. ""Keep the skin looking fresh when doing a cooler eye, and make sure to soften the edge of the shadows and liners to make them more flattering,"" Dubroff advises. For deeper skin tones, she prefers a simple wash of colour across the tip lid, with a pop of the lightest shade in the middle.The 90s were more about fuller faces and powdered looks. Dubroff has a trick for faces that use a cooler colour on the lids. ""I try to give the skin a bit more of a flush,"" she says. Towards the later part of the decade, Dubroff recalls how Drew Barrymore and Liv Tyler went for warmer, more sculpted looks, with some shimmer around the eyelids and nose bridge and bronze work around the cheeks, forehead and chin. This look sits much better with the modern sculpted face and can easily make a comeback.The 90s was the age of lip liners and Dubroff advises going for shades like deep browns and taupes regardless of what colour the lips will be filled in with. Draw along the lip line and fill in the outer corners a little bit. Finally, use a finger to blend the pigment into the lips. Top the job with a sheer lip balm that's not too glossy and mattify it with your fingers to reduce the sheen."

/tech-startup/news/rolls-royce-spectre-the-fully-electric-super-coupe-3147696,Rolls-Royce Spectre: The fully-electric super coupé,"The popular British automaker Rolls-Royce Motor Cars recently announced their brand new Rolls-Royce Spectre, which is being hailed as the world's first ultra-luxury electric super coupé. Spectre is almost 5453 mm long and 2080 mm wide, which is bigger than the new Wraith Coupé. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the Spectre Coupé is the replacement for the Wraith Coupé, for it doesn't have the big 6.6-litre v12 that the Wraith has.Coming to the design, Rolls Royce said that they have taken inspiration from the Phantom Coupé for the Spectre, which is why they call it ""a spiritual successor to the Phantom Coupé"", a 2008 release of Rolls-Royce. The headlights do reminisce of the Phantom Coupé with the daytime running lights and projector lights. The huge grill makes the car stand out as it is the widest grill ever to fit in a Rolls-Royce - it also illuminates using 22 individual LEDs to add more dazzle to its design. The overall design of the Spectre is quite minimalistic and smooth, with hardly any hard edges or sharp body lines, added with a flat underbody. Being an electric car, Rolls-Royce had to take drastic measures to make Spectre as aerodynamic as possible. Even the spirit of ecstasy was given a makeover to reduce drag - small details show how determined they were to make the car more aerodynamic. They were able to achieve a drag coefficient of 0.25 CD which is the best they ever achieved in a production car. The 23-inch wheels in the Spectre are the biggest wheels ever to be fitted in a Rolls-Royce as well. In the back, the minimalistic design continues - the tail lights consist of 2 led bars so that it goes with whichever colour the owner decides to paint in the future.The interior of the Spectre is quite identical to that of the Rolls-Royce Ghost. For example, the air vents, buttons and touchscreen graphics on the displays can be changed by the company to match the interior if they are asked to do so. The screen on the dash has a custom design for the Spectre. Also, the infamous starlight headliner can now be extended to the doors for the first time in any Rolls-Royce and can be customised to show any constellation you want. The rear seats are the masterclass seats of the Spectre, wrapped with supple leather that adds a sense of comfort to the overall look.The battery is located underneath which also makes the chassis more ridged, unlike many other cars. Moreover, the battery itself helps in sound deadening. Though Rolls-Royce is still working on the car and hasn't officially announced anything about the range yet, they said that the finished product should have around 320 miles/ 515 kilometres with all the latest tech - which is pretty decent. The Spectre has an electric motor on each axle which gives it All-Wheel Drive, as well as All-Wheel Steering. With all the motors combined, it should produce about 585 horsepower and 900nm of torque - enough to make the car launch 0-60mph in about 4.5 seconds despite being 2,975 kg. That is very fast for a car that weighs that much.Overall, the car seems to be almost 30% stiffer than any other Rolls-Royce ever produced, so stiff that they didn't give the wishbone dampers. However, the car does have anti-dampers and an anti-rolls system to help in tight corners. The All-Wheel Steering system should also come into play to make the driving experience much smoother. The Rolls-Royce Spectre comes with an exclusive app which will require the car's VIN number to use. You can also make presets of your car's settings and share them with other people who own the Spectre as well. According to Rolls-Royce, you can order the new Rolls-Royce Spectre for £300,000 and get it by December 2023."

/opinion/views/news/why-the-un-security-council-needs-reforms-3147706,Why the UN Security Council needs reforms,"Making the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) more representative, inclusive, and transparent is a hot topic that is being discussed all around the world. The Atlantic Charter was established in 1941 by the United States and Great Britain in response to Nazi Germany's invasion of Europe during World War II. In a sense, this document was essentially a step forward in the establishment of the United Nations. Representatives from 50 nations gathered in San Francisco in 1945 and decided to draft the UN Charter which was formally adopted on June 26, 1945, with a resolute determination to avert war and uphold international peace, stability, and security. However, in practice, it fell short of respecting the organisation's principles.A significant barrier in that regard has been the veto power of the UNSC's permanent members. Any resolution criticising Israel's misdeeds are blocked by the United States. On the other hand, China is applying its veto power to protect Myanmar from taking effective measures in resolving the Rohingya crisis. Given the circumstances, many countries are discussing the need to restructure the UN, particularly through the expansion of its Security Council.The ""Security Council"" consists of five permanent and 10 non-permanent members from among the 193 member countries of the UN. The winners of WW2 – the US, UK, Russia, China, and France – were granted veto power in the UNSC. A UN bill or resolution is void if any of these five nations exercise their veto power. The power can also be used to send military forces or impose sanctions on nations. The primary duty of the council is to safeguard global peace and security. But the veto power of its permanent members has gotten in the way of that. Despite the fact that the 10 non-permanent members are chosen every two years, the decisions of the permanent members are regarded as final – since permanent member countries have the veto power, which the non-permanent members don't.It is undeniable that the Security Council has failed to act timely in regards to various global crises, while carrying out the mandate given to it to settle disputes through peaceful means. Moreover, the veto-wielding nations have been abusing the UN to further their own agendas.The Security Council recently failed to come up with an effective solution to the Rohingya crisis, despite widespread global support for the Rohingyas. China and Russia, the two UN permanent members, supported Myanmar for their own political and economic interests. As of yet, no legal action has been taken against Myanmar for committing genocide against the Rohingya. The Council's unwillingness to act has emboldened the Myanmar military to commit even more crimes. Again, in spite of Israel's aggression in the Palestinian territories and the continuous violation of human rights in the past years, the Council continues to be unable to unanimously agree to take effective action.Article 39 of the UN Charter expressly forbids aggressive war. However, the US invaded Iraq in 2003 without the UN's approval and overthrew Saddam's regime, which was a violation of the UN Charter. Additionally, the US and UK launched airstrikes in Libya in 2011 under the pretext of ""interference in the protection of human rights."" Gaddafi was overthrown after the attack, and Libya is now essentially a failed state. In Syria, similar grievances have been raised. And Russia has recently invaded Ukraine, which the UN failed to prevent. These instances only show that a country's violation of UN policy increases with its power.The continent of Europe only makes up 6.6 percent of the world's total land area. Nevertheless, they are represented by 60 percent of the Security Council (three countries are permanent members). Twenty percent and 12 percent of the world's land respectively are in Africa and South America, yet neither continent has a ""permanent member"" in the UNSC. The Asian continent has a representation rate of under 20 percent, while having more than 60 percent of the world's population. Despite the fact that geographic and regional participation is crucial in many UN forums, it is missing in the UNSC.Since two-thirds of the General Assembly and all Security Council members would need to agree to any reform, increasing the number of permanent members would be challenging. However, given the current state of the world, it is now necessary to either reform the UNSC or increase the number of its permanent members.On September 17, 1974, Bangladesh became the 136th member of the United Nations. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said during the 77th session of the UN General Assembly that other institutional structures, including the UN, needed to undergo practical and essential reforms. Bangladesh, however, has not yet expressed a clear position on what those reforms should be.In that regard, Bangladesh must consider the fact that the Rohingya crisis has repeatedly stumbled due to the veto power. The third committee has approved a number of proposals on the Rohingya issue. But they have not been put into practice. So, Bangladesh needs to find out how reforming the UN may lead to a mechanism that allows for the demands of the UN General Assembly to be met.Seven and a half decades after the establishment of the UN, reforming the UNSC would be a sensible and necessary move to balance the geopolitics of the modern era. How can the UN talk about democracy and equal rights in every country, if there is no representation of global public opinion or equal rights in the UN itself?Kamal Uddin Mazumder is a researcher and security affairs analyst."

/shout/news/our-obsession-making-entertainment-educational-3147086,Our obsession with making entertainment educational  ,"Shah Rukh Khan once quoted Samuel Goldwyn, who famously said, ""Pictures are for entertainment; messages should be delivered by Western Union.""With the recent surge in fixation with messages in TV dramas or cinemas in Bangladesh, the quote somehow makes more sense than ever.With a boom in the entertainment industry coupled with changing audience preferences, the portrayal of characters has changed over the years. Creators are now bold enough to write characters that are more authentic, real, and human. That's when characters start to trot around the greyer aspects of humanity, in contrast to the black-and-white portrayals of protagonists and antagonists in the past.In recent years, accents on screen have become more authentic and natural. Sure, the authentic accent might sound ""uglier"" than the formal socially-accepted tone, but that's a compromise necessary for the sake of realism. If a director is dealing with characters from regions other than Dhaka, it is only fair that the characters will talk in the local dialect.When the character of Chan Majhi from Hawa, played by Chanchal Chowdhury, cusses his subordinates, it aids in building the world of fishermen in the Bay of Bengal and one that is honest to its roots. However, the dialogue was deemed to be crass and inappropriate for audiences, which resulted in backlash for the movie.Similarly, when a protagonist has anger issues or emotional baggage like that of Afran Nisho in Kaiser, the creator is not necessarily telling you to idolise these aspects of Kaiser. Rather, these are tools to make the character more compelling. These traits also help the audience to understand Kaiser's state of mind and sympathise with the character in his state of vulnerability.In the web series Mohanagar, OC Harun, played by Mosharraf Karim, is a corrupt police officer who is willing to compromise anything for the sake of his greed, until his morality stands in his way. The display of OC Harun's greed, hypocrisy, and evil intentions was necessary for the audience to realise the gravity of the decision he took in the climax. But the portrayal was met with some negative reception due to his obscene nature.That brings us to our blindness as an audience. Are we truly delusional enough to censor everything that portrays human beings as the vile and obscene species they are? If the characters are human, they are bound to have flaws, vulnerability, lust, greed, and everything evil that may be ingrained in human nature.  Maybe all forms of entertainment don't necessarily need to have a message in them.Additionally, the censor board should, for once, just be a board about film certification and not unfairly ban whatever goes slightly against societal sensibilities. If a movie is deemed to be inappropriate for the younger audience, it should be certified accordingly, rather than be censored or banned.Lastly, when it comes to entertainment not being watchable with the entire family, there's a very simple solution to it rather than wanting to cancel the show.Just don't watch it with your family.Remind Ifti to be quieter at hasiburrashidifti@gmail.com

It read:  ""Congrats NSU to become the #1 University of Bangladesh.
This email is mainly sent to awareness about the major security issue of this email which should be fixed."" From screenshots circulated by students of NSU, it is understood that the hackers sought to expose the major underlying security issues of the institution and urged the authorities to take care of the problem. This mail was sent following Times Higher Education (THE) publishing its global university rankings with NSU reportedly outranking all other universities within the country. A similar incident occurred in September when Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) announced that they would form committees in private universities. Students of BRACU reported that a group of hackers broke into the BRACU registrar's email and sent out a warning that advised against practising any form of politics within the campus. "

Anika stood in the middle of a strange place full of strange people and thought to herself, ""What am I doing here?""Everywhere around her, people exchanged courtesies and danced and squealed exuberantly. Anika couldn't read their facial expressions; everyone wore a mask since it was a masquerade ball. Even though she couldn't read their emotions, she guessed they must be over the moon, being invited to such an elite event.Her appearance at this extravagant ball didn't make any sense. If her life were a movie, she would be a background character whom nobody took notice of. No, if her life were a movie, she probably would be that background character whose scene got cut out in the editing room. She didn't fit in a place that was so obviously reserved for protagonists. Anika stood out like a plain loaf of bread stands out amidst a platter of gold-flaked pastries.She desperately wanted to put up an act, to pretend like she had it all. But she knew she could never fake it, everyone was so truly accomplished that they would whiff her out in an instant. She was not scared of being labelled a fake. After all, she had known it her whole life – rather she was just terrified of the aftermath. Unmistakably, they would make a spectacle of her. They would drag her under the spotlight and announce to the world what a con artist she was. Thinking about the consequences made her nauseous. Anika wanted to run away before anyone in the room could figure out that she didn't belong there. ""That wouldn't be too bad. I would drift away in the nothingness of the ocean. It would be so tranquil..."" she thought. ""Hey, Anika, right?"" she hadn't noticed that somebody had appeared in front of her.""Yeah,"" she tried to recall where she had seen him before, but her memory failed her.""Are you enjoying the party?"" he asked with a euphonious voice.""Um, yeah. It's terrific,"" she offered a smile.He looked at her with a bemused expression, like she had said something funny. ""He knows I'm a fraud. He's here to catch me before I slip,"" her mind raced. Before she could come up with an excuse to evade him, he reached his arm out. ""What's in his hands? Handcuffs?"" she asked herself.  Before her thoughts trailed any further, he spoke up, sparing Anika from spiralling into her head where would conjure up at least a thousand different ways to escape him.""Let's dance,"" he said earnestly.The next thing she knew, she was in the middle of the room, dancing with a person with sun-kissed hair, sparkly eyes, and a dazzling smile. He represented everything good and happy. Naturally, dancing with such a jolly spirit didn't make any sense, but surprisingly it didn't bother her. As she moved around the floor and twirled and dipped her head, the outside world began to blur. Anika didn't care that her steps were out of sync with the rhythm or that they were too clumsy. She was giggling, flailing her arms around carelessly, breathing in without trails of thoughts in between them.Anika felt relief. She was too burdened with everyone's expectations in her mind, too busy executing a version of herself that not even she recognized – she forgot what it was like to live in a world without worries. She soared through the air, thinking how beautiful it was to live but then the song came to an end.People left one by one, leaving her stranded in the middle of the room, making room for her worries to crawl back. For a moment, she let herself live in a fantasy. However, that fantasy had to fade away, like all good things in the universe.Anika wondered as she snuck out of the party, ""Why did I come here again?"""

/star-literature/news/monica-ali-writing-multicultural-london-3147501,Monica Ali: Writing on Multicultural London,"Born to a Bangladeshi father and British mother on October 20 1967, Monica Ali is best known in Bangladesh for her debut novel Brick Lane (2003). The unpublished manuscript of the novel paved way for her to be selected as one of the ""Best of Young British Novelists"" by Granta magazine. Later, Brick Lane was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. In 2007, the story full of literary depth was adapted as a film of the same name. Since then, Ali has published four more novels, the last of which titled Love Marriage was published earlier this year by Virago Press and became an instant Sunday Times bestseller.       Even though critically acclaimed, Brick Lane also provoked controversy within the Bangladeshi community in Britain. Some felt that Ali had portrait the Sylhetti community in a negative light as most people who live in the Brick Lane area are from the division of Sylhet in Bangladesh.       Monica Ali's second novel Alentejo Blue is about a small village community in Portugal. While with her first book, the author had announced her arrival in a literary scene, with her second, she did not quite make it. As a reviewer in The Guardian noted, ""given the expectations we already have of Ali, it's hard not to find this book a let-down."" At the same time, the characters of the novel are all minutely and beautifully sketched, but there is no story to hold them together.       Critics found Untold Story (2011) to be loosely woven around the life of the Princess Diana. It is almost a ""what if"" type narrative which addresses questions like ""what if the princess had not died, what if her death was orchestrated and she found a quiet life elsewhere. None of these books, however, held the charm of her first novel and Monica Ali herself in 2011 resolved never to write again. She claimed to have lost her spirit and confidence.       Then in February 2022, after a ten years hiatus, Monica Ali came back with Love-Marriage. Set in London, the story is about Yasmin Ghorami, a 26-year-old junior doctor, engaged to a fellow doctor named Joe Sangster. Tash Aw describes the book in Times Literary Supplement as ""rich, sensitive and gloriously entertaining novel...brimming with extremely funny moments of excruciating social comedy."" The novel also brings in the rich cultural diversity of Britain. Critical and cultural responses to this book have been very positive and Ali has already let the media know that the television rights to Love-Marriage has been sold to New Pictures and it currently being developed with BBC."

/round-tables/news/violence-against-female-sex-workers-dhaka-city-3147246,Violence against female sex workers in Dhaka city,"Sex Workers Network (SWN) organized a research findings dissemination session titled ""Qualitative study on violence among the female sex workers in Dhaka City, Bangladesh"" on September 22, 2022. The study was funded by CREA, an international feminist human rights organization. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.Furkan Hossain, Chairman and CEO, Research and Management Consultants Ltd.The Sex Workers Network (SWN) is leading the coalition of 29 community-based organisations of sex workers and, therefore, it is well-acquainted with the real scenario of violence experienced by sex workers.SWN recently conducted a qualitative study titled 'Violence among the Female Sex Workers in Dhaka City'. The purpose of the study was to understand various forms of violence that female sex workers experience in Dhaka City. The study also identified ways to prevent these violence and exploitation.Two types of data sources were used for the research -- primary and secondary sources. As primary sources, we took in-depth interviews of 40 female sex workers (FSWs) and conducted eight Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) with 49 female sex workers. The study team also did 15 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) to collect information about policy, key interventions and recommendations.Previous study reports such as Mapping study and size estimation of key populations in Bangladesh for HIV programs 2016, National AIDS/STD Control Programme (NASP), Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS) 2020, AIDS/STD Programme (ASP) were used as secondary sources.In 2016, the National AIDS/STD Control Program (NASP) divided female sex workers into several categories such as street-based, hotel-based and residence-based. The study team has tried to find out whether these categories have changed over time.From August 15 to September 5, 2022 the study team collected data in Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation. They focused on three categories of female sex workers: Street based Female Sex Workers (SBFSW), Hotel based Female Sex Workers (HBFSW) and Residence based Female Sex Workers (RBFSW). The study findings reveal that the settings/catagories of sex workers have changed significantly. Now, a FSW works in multiple settings in the city.  Among the 40 female sex workers, 31 received some sort of schooling, formal or informal, and 29 are below or 30 years of age. The study finds that most of the participants live in rented house. They generally live with their husbands or alone. 37 FSWs had their first sex under 17 years of age, and 55 percent of the study participants had their first sex against their will. 10 participants are now involved in various occupations such as housemaid and garments worker, besides being sex workers. 77 percent FSWs earn more than 15,000 Tk per month from sex work. However, 31 study participants shared that they were forced to give a share from their earnings to dalals (pimps), members of law enforcement agencies and babus.The study further reveals that 19 FSWs went outside Dhaka to have sex with their clients within the last 12 months. Most of them went to Cox's Bazar with their clients.Among the 40 participants, 27 became pregnant at least once and 17 of them at or under 17 years of age.  26 participants had abortions/MR and 76 percent of them had abortion/MR on their own will.55 percent of the study participants use smartphones, and among them, 95.5 percent use imo and 52.6 percent use Facebook. They face various types of online harassments by the clients such as blackmailing and threat of sharing of images and video online.The study reveals that all the participants faced violence while working outdoors; indoor workspaces were also not safe for most of them. The most common forms of violence they face are being beaten up by clients, threat of physical violence and rape attempt. Some of them were also raped by their clients.The dilemma regarding sex work as a profession prevailed among sex workers and key informants due to legal barriers. Some of them regret being sex workers as society doesn't accept them or their children. Schools don't allow their children to study, and therefore, the children go astray; boys become drug peddler or engage in petty crimes, and girls often choose their mothers' profession. FSWs struggle to find suitable housing and they have to pay high rent. They suffered greatly during COVID-19 due to the lack of savings, food and clients. They had to borrow money with high interest rates. They also faced police violence during the pandemic. Sex workers are in total darkness about the laws that can safeguard them. They also believe that the government wouldn't be able to bring the issue of their rights into a legal framework in Bangladesh.The doctors and male pharmacists, according to the female sex workers, don't treat them well. However, they get better treatments from the NGOs. 37 out of the 40 female sex workers received COVID-19 vaccines.The study made the following recommendations:Aroma Dutta, Member of Parliament and Member, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Welfare
Understanding the life of sex workers in Bangladesh is not easy. They lead a vulnerable life and face a lot of challenges such as harassment, violence and denial of basic rights. The study has done a recommendable job in finding out the problems faced by female sex workers in Dhaka city. However, the study has mentioned nothing about the class dynamics of FSWs which has a significant impact on their  life.
We need to ensure that all the sex workers get benefits of the social safety net programmes as a citizen of Bangladesh. They must be provided with NID cards. They should also be provided with technical training so that they can become entrepreneurs and find alternative livelihoods.
The SWN should identify the loopholes in the implementation of the laws regarding the protection and welfare of sex workers in Bangladesh.
 








Dr. Lima Rahman, Director, Health, Nutrition & HIV/AIDS Sector, Save the Children
We don't have much data regarding stigma, violence, and discrimination against sex workers. Although this research is not a national-level study, several of the indexes from this study are very useful. I would request data triangulation such as finding out the changing patterns of violence among sex workers and the reasons behind young married women coming to this profession. These additional data will help us choose a right direction and design our programs better.
 








Aleya Akhter Lily, President, Sex Workers Network
The study tried to understand the nature and magnitude of violence against female sex workers in Dhaka city. It also tried to find out some effective solutions to this problem. We are presenting the findings of the study to experts and activists to get their feedback and formulate an action plan to combat violence against female sex workers. We are seeking support from all of you since the Sex Workers Network would not be able to bring the change alone. We will enhance our engagement with all the relevant stakeholders, including decision-makers, concerned ministries, and donor organizations to carry forward the cause.
 








Dr. Rawnak Jahan, National Consultant, UNAIDS
Due to the lack of representation from sex workers in today's programme, we have missed the opportunity to know about their observation and demands. Although we have gained some significant insights, a larger sample size would have been preferable.
Sex workers typically lack savings, and they don't get support from the social safety net programmes. Many sex workers become dalal in order to subsist after retiring from their profession. Thus, it is crucially important to engage in advocacy with the relevant agencies to ensure social protection supports for the vulnerable elderly female sex workers.
 








Abdullah Al Hasan, Technical Coordinator, Advocacy & Capacity Building, CARE Bangladesh
The study followed the four settings mentioned in the National AIDS/STD Control Programme (NASP), 2016. However, the study should have included two more settings -- spa or massage centres and dance bars. The study only mentioned physical violence; we need to look at the psychological aspects of violence as well.
The government has taken a few good initiatives such as establishing one-stop crisis centres, shelter homes and a hotline number to combat violence against women. I don't think any special helpline for sex workers is required at this moment.
 








Jahanara Khatun, Assistant Program Manager, Naripokkho
The Sex Workers Network should have shared the findings with its affiliated organizations before public dissemination. It is important to inform sex workers about the study's findings because it is about the challenges they experience in their everyday lives. I always want them to lead the solution.
Instead of establishing new hotline numbers or services we should focus on increasing the efficiency of the existing one-stop crisis centres and help lines.
 








Nurun Nahar Begum, Sr. Program Officer, ActionAid
Sex workers are not aware of their fundamental rights. They also face various challenges due to the lack of formal recognition of their profession and the hostile attitude of the law enforcement agencies. Without protecting their fundamental rights, it is impossible to bring changes in the lives of sex workers. As citizens of this country, they must enjoy the rights guaranteed by the constitution. They should exercise their right to bargain collectively.
 








Md. Abdus Sobhan, Technical Specialist, Save the Children
We always ask sex workers about their problems not the solutions they want. Future studies on sex workers can consider this neglected aspect. I would like to request the Sex Workers Network to discuss the findings of this study with policy makers and inform them about the problems female sex workers face in their everyday lives.
 








Babul Kumar Adhikary, General Secretary, STI/AIDS Network of Bangladesh
In most cases, sex workers are not aware of the legal concepts of violence and harassment. It is the responsibility of the Sex Workers Network to educate and make them aware of these issues.  The Network should also work for reaching the findings of the study to the policy makers.
 








Joya Sarker, President, SomporkerNoyaSetu
Generally, we collect data to understand a problem. However, in this study, the problem is apparently absent. The study, for example, could have covered issues related to the reproductive health of female sex workers or the risk of HIV infection among female sex workers due to violence by clients.
I strongly feel that representatives from sex workers should have been invited to today's programme. They could have identified missing points and errors in the study better than us.
 








MD. Hafizuddin Munna, General Secretary, PLHIV Network (PN+)
In Bangladesh, a sizable portion of the sex workers are HIV positive. Sex workers and drug users are considered potentially risky groups in the government's HIV program because of the connection between HIV, sex, and drug use. The use of drugs is widespread among sex workers. Information about HIV-positive sex workers and risky sexual behaviour among clients could have been included in the study.
 








Shahdat Hossain, Member, Network of People Who Use Drugs (NPUD)
Building awareness is essential for combating violence against sex workers. Creating a separate helpline for sex workers can be an option since they are unwilling to seek help from the law enforcement agencies. The platform can also help build a strong collaboration between the government and the organizations who work for the sex workers.
 








Rabiullah Islam, Program & Resource Officer, SEHD
We published a study report in 2018 on the conditions of floating and brothel-based sex workers. I believe, we need to reach the voice of sex workers to the policy level to prevent violence against them. Sex Workers Network can play a big role in establishing communications between sex workers and relevant government bodies such as the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Department of Social Service.
 








Rajkumary, Volunteer, Oboyob
The study has produced a lot of data but lacks an intersectional approach. It, for example, doesn't give us a clear picture of the relation between violence and earning. It's not like that a sex worker can avoid paying to a dalal if she gives money to the police. They are often forced to share their earnings with dalals, members of law enforcement agencies and babus.  
 








Ivan Ahmed Katha, President,  Shacheton Shamajsheba Hijra Shanga
Sex workers generally have reservations about disclosing personal information. Therefore, this study holds critical importance since it analysed the experience of 40 female sex workers in Dhaka. If the recommendations of the study are implemented properly it will bring positive changes to the life of sex workers in Bangladesh.
 








MD. Niaz Morshed Khan, Sr. Research Investigator, icddr,b
The study followed a mixed methodology by combining both qualitative and quantitative data. Therefore, we must exercise caution in analyzing the findings of the study. While disseminating the study findings, it must be mentioned that the study selected a small sample size purposefully and the aim of the study was not to make a generalization. I am not sure whether the study got approval from any ethical board. If not, then, that should be mentioned in the limitation section of the study.  
Understanding the life of sex workers in Bangladesh is not easy. They lead a vulnerable life and face a lot of challenges such as harassment, violence and denial of basic rights. The study has done a recommendable job in finding out the problems faced by female sex workers in Dhaka city. However, the study has mentioned nothing about the class dynamics of FSWs which has a significant impact on their  life.We need to ensure that all the sex workers get benefits of the social safety net programmes as a citizen of Bangladesh. They must be provided with NID cards. They should also be provided with technical training so that they can become entrepreneurs and find alternative livelihoods.The SWN should identify the loopholes in the implementation of the laws regarding the protection and welfare of sex workers in Bangladesh.Dr. Lima Rahman, Director, Health, Nutrition & HIV/AIDS Sector, Save the Children
We don't have much data regarding stigma, violence, and discrimination against sex workers. Although this research is not a national-level study, several of the indexes from this study are very useful. I would request data triangulation such as finding out the changing patterns of violence among sex workers and the reasons behind young married women coming to this profession. These additional data will help us choose a right direction and design our programs better.
 








Aleya Akhter Lily, President, Sex Workers Network
The study tried to understand the nature and magnitude of violence against female sex workers in Dhaka city. It also tried to find out some effective solutions to this problem. We are presenting the findings of the study to experts and activists to get their feedback and formulate an action plan to combat violence against female sex workers. We are seeking support from all of you since the Sex Workers Network would not be able to bring the change alone. We will enhance our engagement with all the relevant stakeholders, including decision-makers, concerned ministries, and donor organizations to carry forward the cause.
 








Dr. Rawnak Jahan, National Consultant, UNAIDS
Due to the lack of representation from sex workers in today's programme, we have missed the opportunity to know about their observation and demands. Although we have gained some significant insights, a larger sample size would have been preferable.
Sex workers typically lack savings, and they don't get support from the social safety net programmes. Many sex workers become dalal in order to subsist after retiring from their profession. Thus, it is crucially important to engage in advocacy with the relevant agencies to ensure social protection supports for the vulnerable elderly female sex workers.
 








Abdullah Al Hasan, Technical Coordinator, Advocacy & Capacity Building, CARE Bangladesh
The study followed the four settings mentioned in the National AIDS/STD Control Programme (NASP), 2016. However, the study should have included two more settings -- spa or massage centres and dance bars. The study only mentioned physical violence; we need to look at the psychological aspects of violence as well.
The government has taken a few good initiatives such as establishing one-stop crisis centres, shelter homes and a hotline number to combat violence against women. I don't think any special helpline for sex workers is required at this moment.
 








Jahanara Khatun, Assistant Program Manager, Naripokkho
The Sex Workers Network should have shared the findings with its affiliated organizations before public dissemination. It is important to inform sex workers about the study's findings because it is about the challenges they experience in their everyday lives. I always want them to lead the solution.
Instead of establishing new hotline numbers or services we should focus on increasing the efficiency of the existing one-stop crisis centres and help lines.

The Sex Workers Network should have shared the findings with its affiliated organizations before public dissemination. It is important to inform sex workers about the study's findings because it is about the challenges they experience in their everyday lives. I always want them to lead the solution.Instead of establishing new hotline numbers or services we should focus on increasing the efficiency of the existing one-stop crisis centres and help lines.Nurun Nahar Begum, Sr. Program Officer, ActionAid
Sex workers are not aware of their fundamental rights. They also face various challenges due to the lack of formal recognition of their profession and the hostile attitude of the law enforcement agencies. Without protecting their fundamental rights, it is impossible to bring changes in the lives of sex workers. As citizens of this country, they must enjoy the rights guaranteed by the constitution. They should exercise their right to bargain collectively.
 








Md. Abdus Sobhan, Technical Specialist, Save the Children
We always ask sex workers about their problems not the solutions they want. Future studies on sex workers can consider this neglected aspect. I would like to request the Sex Workers Network to discuss the findings of this study with policy makers and inform them about the problems female sex workers face in their everyday lives.
 








Babul Kumar Adhikary, General Secretary, STI/AIDS Network of Bangladesh
In most cases, sex workers are not aware of the legal concepts of violence and harassment. It is the responsibility of the Sex Workers Network to educate and make them aware of these issues.  The Network should also work for reaching the findings of the study to the policy makers.

Generally, we collect data to understand a problem. However, in this study, the problem is apparently absent. The study, for example, could have covered issues related to the reproductive health of female sex workers or the risk of HIV infection among female sex workers due to violence by clients.
I strongly feel that representatives from sex workers should have been invited to today's programme. They could have identified missing points and errors in the study better than us.
 








MD. Hafizuddin Munna, General Secretary, PLHIV Network (PN+)
In Bangladesh, a sizable portion of the sex workers are HIV positive. Sex workers and drug users are considered potentially risky groups in the government's HIV program because of the connection between HIV, sex, and drug use. The use of drugs is widespread among sex workers. Information about HIV-positive sex workers and risky sexual behaviour among clients could have been included in the study.
 








Shahdat Hossain, Member, Network of People Who Use Drugs (NPUD)
Building awareness is essential for combating violence against sex workers. Creating a separate helpline for sex workers can be an option since they are unwilling to seek help from the law enforcement agencies. The platform can also help build a strong collaboration between the government and the organizations who work for the sex workers.
 








Rabiullah Islam, Program & Resource Officer, SEHD
We published a study report in 2018 on the conditions of floating and brothel-based sex workers. I believe, we need to reach the voice of sex workers to the policy level to prevent violence against them. Sex Workers Network can play a big role in establishing communications between sex workers and relevant government bodies such as the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Department of Social Service.

The study has produced a lot of data but lacks an intersectional approach. It, for example, doesn't give us a clear picture of the relation between violence and earning. It's not like that a sex worker can avoid paying to a dalal if she gives money to the police. They are often forced to share their earnings with dalals, members of law enforcement agencies and babus.  
 








Ivan Ahmed Katha, President,  Shacheton Shamajsheba Hijra Shanga
Sex workers generally have reservations about disclosing personal information. Therefore, this study holds critical importance since it analysed the experience of 40 female sex workers in Dhaka. If the recommendations of the study are implemented properly it will bring positive changes to the life of sex workers in Bangladesh.

/business/news/high-duty-obstacle-bangladeshs-export-malaysia-munshi-3147781,High duty an obstacle for Bangladesh’s export to Malaysia: Munshi,"The country could not harness the export potential of Malaysia because of high tariff imposed on Bangladeshi goods, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said today.The high tariff has been working as a deterrent factor on shipment of goods from Bangladesh to Malaysia, the bilateral trade is swelling towards Malaysia, he said.Munshi made the comments after a meeting with Haznah Md Hashim, Malaysian high commissioner to Bangladesh, at the minister's secretariat office in Dhaka.Bangladesh is one of the major importers of Malaysian vegetable fat and palm oil.For instance, Bangladesh imported goods worth $3.28 billion and exported goods worth only $337.81 million last fiscal year, according to data of the commerce ministry.Munshi also said Bangladesh has already sent a list of potential exportable items seeking duty waiver from Malaysia, but the latter did not respond to the demand, said a statement from the commerce ministry.Hashim said Malaysia wants to export Malaysian cars to Bangladesh but the high import duty is acting as a barrier here, the statement added."
/news/world/uk/news/who-will-replace-liz-truss-3148036,Who will replace Liz Truss?,"Liz Truss said on Thursday she would resign as British prime minister just six weeks after she was appointed.A leadership election will be completed within the next week to replace Truss, who is the shortest serving prime minister in British history. George Canning previously held the record, serving 119 days in 1827 when he died.1922 Committee chair Graham Brady set out some details on how the successor would be chosen and said he would give further information on the process later in the day.Given the divisions in the party there is no obvious candidate and any replacement would face a country likely heading into a recession. Leading names are below:Rishi SunakBritain's former finance minister was the most popular candidate among Conservative lawmakers at Westminster in a leadership contest earlier this year but, after getting through to a run-off against Truss, he lost out in a vote involving some 170,000 party members who made the final decision.Many members were angry when Sunak quit in July, helping to trigger a rebellion that eventually brought down Johnson. They also ignored his warning that markets could lose confidence in Britain if Truss delivered her unfunded tax cuts.The Telegraph reported on Thursday that Sunak was ""certain"" to stand in the leadership contest.Penny MordauntA former defence secretary, Mordaunt was a passionate supporter of leaving the European Union who only just missed out on the final two-place run off in the recent leadership challenge.Mordaunt won plaudits for her performance in parliament on Monday, when she defended the government even as it reversed most of its policies.One lawmaker has described Mordaunt as having ""broad appeal"", referring to her ability to find friends in the various tribes of the party.Jeremy HuntAfter Truss's economic programme collapsed and she fired her finance minister, she turned to Hunt, a former health and foreign minister, to put things right.A series of confident performances on television and in the House of Commons, as he ripped up Truss's economic manifesto, have already led to some Conservative lawmakers referring to Hunt as the ""real prime minister"".He has insisted he does not want the top job, despite entering two previous races to become prime minister, including in 2019 when he lost out in the final round to former prime minister Boris Johnson. Hunt does not have the obvious support of a large group of lawmakers in parliament.Ben WallaceBritain's defence secretary is one of the few ministers to have emerged from recent political turmoil with his credibility enhanced. Wallace, a former soldier, was defence minister for both Johnson and Truss, leading Britain's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Popular with party members, he surprised many earlier this year when he said he wouldn't run for the leadership, saying he wanted to focus on his current job. He told the Times newspaper this week that he still wanted to stay as defence secretary.Boris JohnsonFormer prime minister Johnson, a journalist, has loomed large over British politics ever since he became London Mayor in 2008. After causing trouble for leaders such as David Cameron and Theresa May, he finally became prime minister in 2019 and went on to win a landslide election victory.Johnson was the face of the Brexit vote and won votes in parts of the country that had never voted Conservative before. But he was forced out by a string of scandals.Some closest to him say at the moment he is more interested in making money on the speech circuit than returning to frontline politics.The Times reported that Johnson is expected to stand in the Conservative Party leadership contest. ""He's taking soundings but is said to believe it is a matter of national interest,"" Times Political Editor Steven Swinford said on Twitter."

As such, launching this programme at the university level ensures Bangladesh's youths and future human resources receive the necessary training prior to entering the job market.""This partnership is the first of its kind in Bangladesh, where a financial institution has co-created a certificate curriculum with a university to develop talent for an area that is important for the entire financial sector, it said.To this end, Standard Chartered Bangladesh and BRAC University signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at the bank's head office in Dhaka.Naser Ezaz Bijoy, chief executive officer of Standard Chartered Bangladesh; Vincent Chang, vice chancellor of BRAC University; and other executives were present for the MoU signing event.Addressing the event, Bijoy said, ""Tackling financial crime is an integral part of Standard Chartered's mission and operations. Working together with organisations to share knowledge and act swiftly in response to evolving threats better prepares us all to identify and thwart financial crime.""""Financial crimes are a significant ongoing challenge for institutions and individuals. This industry-academia partnership will help us better examine the extent and costs of the deceptions alongside major regulatory and criminal justice policy options,"" Prof Chang said.""Eventually, it can play a vital role in taking further measures that need to be in place to both protect institutions and individuals and achieve regulatory compliance."""

The incident has been a flashpoint for one of the boldest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution.""My counterparts and I will gather to send a clear message: the Iranian regime must end all forms of violence and persecution against the Iranian people, including their brutal aggressions against women in particular,"" Joly said.""Canada will continue to stand by the courageous Iranians who are fighting for their human rights and standing up for their mothers, sisters, wives and daughters. Women's rights are human rights,"" she said.
Foreign ministers from Germany, Chile, New Zealand and Norway are among the 14 who will join Canada, a government source said. France will join the call, but Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna will not be able to, said the source.During the meeting, officials will hear from women of Iranian heritage and discuss the state of women's and human rights in Iran, Joly's office said, adding that it would give them an opportunity to coordinate efforts and discuss ""ways to increase their collective support for the Iranian people.""
Canada had joined other nations, including the United States, in imposing sanctions on Iran.Joly announced additional sanctions on Wednesday over human rights violations in Iran, targeting four entities and six individuals, including Iran's Deputy Interior Minister Majid Mirahmadi. read moreWhile the current unrest does not appear close to toppling the Iranian government, the situation has raised international concerns as talks on Iran's nuclear capabilities appear at a stalemate and Tehran has moved to support Russia's invasion in Ukraine in defiance of the West.Iran has accused countries who have expressed support for the protests of meddling in its internal affairs.Amini, who hailed from Iran's Kurdistan region, died September 16 after being detained three days earlier by morality police in Tehran for her ""inappropriate attire"".Iran's religious leaders have tried to portray the unrest as part of a breakaway uprising by the Kurdish minority threatening the nation's unity, rather than a protest against clerical rule.Other countries expected to participate in the meeting are Albania, Andorra, the Central African Republic, Chile, Iceland, Kosovo, Libya, Liechtenstein, Mongolia and Panama."
/daily-star-books/news/can-city-hold-home-3147466,"Can a city hold a home? - Shagufta Sharmeen Tania’s short story, “What Men Live By”","""What Men Live By"" opens like a children's story—the way Matilda or most Roald Dahl books would start out—with simple, everyday events and straightforward descriptions. Eventually, though, one line caught my attention and I couldn't help but smile: ""Here they referred to weather like this as four seasons in one day"". It reminded me of my brief stay away from home in Melbourne—where they said the same.What I found out gradually was that there was more 'telling' in this story, as opposed to the expert-prescribed 'showing'. ""I was too young to understand the conflict between Safdar and my mother"", the narrator's child self reflects matter-of-factly. Presenting, perhaps to a foreign reader, the nuances of her native culture and ideas that we take for granted, she writes, ""Back in those days in our country, [insane people] were forced to marry to 'cure' their madness"". The distinction in the voice—one, that of the adult narrator and the other, of the child observer—comes through without hitches.The narrator's memories—and the makeup of the plot—revolve around a Mahua tree named Fuljharia, planted by her uncle, Safdar, in their Kalyanpur house. It disappoints and deprives the family for years by not ""flowering on moonlit nights, nor providing ghee or deworming medicine"". Parallels of the 'unfruitful' tree are drawn with Safdar whose marriage, mental health, and eventually Safdar himself ""[break] down"". However, the tree springs back to life and ""large cracks show in the grey trunk, like the passage of time"", restoring a silver lining of hope for the family, for the young narrator, and the readers.Upon being shortlisted for the Commonwealth Prize, Shagufta Sharmeen told The Daily Star that her ""story concerns the lost souls of a metropolis… those magnificent beasts that cannot find their places in a growing, sprawling cityscape"".In that vein, the narrative also highlights Madhu, a beautiful, big white rabbit with ruby eyes, who had been brought from Belgium for animal testing. Despite being wanted by the narrator, the rabbit's advances of friendship are rejected by the long term resident and housecat, Satin. Soon, ""members of our household became impatient with Madhu's ways"" of digging holes everywhere. The narrator's cousin eventually takes it home to a colony, where people come to visit it, even asking to adopt it.The writer's sentiment about lost souls shine through here—it projected onto my mind an image of a giant rabbit trapped in a maze of buildings and urban structures, looking for a home.I found the narrative to be poignant, having stayed away from home for some time. It invoked a sense of nostalgia: the setting of colonies, trees, pets; Kalyanpur felt known. An introspective piece written by a displaced adult shaped by the memories of home, from the perspective of a child trying to grasp at a carousel of events happening around her—there was a thread that bound her experiences to mine.Yet, the events that she wrote about, although familiar, felt distant. To satisfy my curiosity I ventured to read the original Bangla version, ""Manush Ja Niye Bache"". I then understood why I couldn't quite connect to them.Judging from its title, a native speaker would be able to tell that the English translation (done by the author herself) doesn't quite have the same impact as that of the Bangla; there is big disparity between the Bangla title and the gendered, implied meaning of the title in English. In Bangla the story sounds closer to home. The tone in the original is more poetic, the characters and events more wholesome and endearing. Maisha Syeda is a writer, painter, and the Sub-editor of Daily Star Books.

/environment/natural-resources/energy/news/the-russian-problem-new-us-nuclear-power-industry-3147926,The Russian problem of new US nuclear power industry,"US firms developing a new generation of small nuclear power plants to help cut carbon emissions have a big problem: only one company sells the fuel they need, and it's Russian.That's why the US government is urgently looking to use some of its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium to help fuel the new advanced reactors and kick-start an industry it sees as crucial for countries to meet global net-zero emissions goals.""Production of HALEU is a critical mission and all efforts to increase its production are being evaluated,"" a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said.The energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine has renewed interest in nuclear power. Backers of smaller, next-generation reactors say they are more efficient, quicker to build, and could turbocharge the shift away from fossil fuels.But without a reliable source of the high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) the reactors need, developers worry they won't receive orders for their plants. And without orders, potential producers of the fuel are unlikely to get commercial supply chains up and running to replace the Russian uranium.""We understand the need for urgent action to incentivize the establishment of a sustainable, market-driven supply of HALEU,"" the DOE spokesperson said.The US government is in the final stages of evaluating how much of its inventory of 585.6 tonnes of highly enriched uranium to allocate to reactors, the spokesperson said.The fact that Russia has a monopoly on HALEU has long been a concern for Washington but the war in Ukraine has changed the game, as neither the government nor the companies developing the new advanced reactors want to rely on Moscow.HALEU is enriched to levels of up to 20%, rather than around 5% for the uranium that powers most nuclear plants. But only TENEX, which is part of Russian state-owned nuclear energy company Rosatom, sells HALEU commercially at the moment.While no Western countries have sanctioned Rosatom over Ukraine, mainly because of its importance to the global nuclear industry, US power plant developers such as X-energy and TerraPower don't want to be dependent on a Russian supply chain.""We didn't have a fuel problem until a few months ago,"" said Jeff Navin, director of external affairs at TerraPower, whose chairman is billionaire Bill Gates. ""After the invasion of Ukraine, we were not comfortable doing business with Russia.""Nuclear power currently generates about 10% of the world's electricity and many countries are now exploring new nuclear projects to improve their energy supply and energy security, as well as to help meet goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.But with large-scale projects still challenging for reasons including huge up-front costs, project delays, cost overruns and competition from cheaper energy sources such as wind, several developers have proposed so-called small modular reactors (SMR).While the SMRs on offer from companies such as EDF (EDF.PA) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) use existing technology and the same fuel as traditional reactors, nine out of 10 of the advanced reactors funded by Washington are designed to use HALEU.Proponents say these advanced plants need less frequent refuelling and are three times as efficient as traditional models. Some analysts say this means they will ultimately overtake conventional nuclear technology, though the designs have yet to be tested on a commercial scale.The average levelised cost of electricity - the price needed for advanced projects to break even - is $60 per megawatt-hour compared with $97 for conventional plants, according to data from research group the Energy Innovation Reform Project.Some analysts say the price difference might be narrower at the moment, because the smaller advanced reactors using HALEU don't yet have economies of scale from mass production.Companies in the United States and Europe have plans to produce HALEU on a commercial scale but even in the most optimistic scenarios, they say it would take at least five years from the point they decide to proceed.And this chicken and egg conundrum is complicating the smooth development of HALEU supply.""Nobody wants to order 10 reactors without a fuel source, and nobody wants to invest in a fuel source without 10 reactor orders,"" said Daniel Poneman, chief executive of US nuclear fuel supplier Centrus Energy Corp (LEU.A).For firms interested in new advanced reactors, such as Washington state's public utility Energy Northwest, fuel supplies are certainly an issue in the decision making process.""A reliable HALEU supply is one of many factors under consideration,"" the company said in an emailed statement.The US government recognised years ago that Russia's monopoly on HALEU could hamper the development of the advanced reactors it hopes will provide low-carbon energy at home and also be exported to markets in Europe and Asia.The government awarded a shared-cost contract in 2019 to Centrus, the only company outside Russia which currently has a licence to make HALEU, to build a demonstration facility.While the facility was due to start making HALEU this year, production has been put back to 2023, partly because of delays in getting hold of storage containers due to supply chain issues during the global pandemic, Centrus said.Once the facility gets up and running, it will take five years before Centrus can start producing 13 tonnes of HALEU a year. But that's only a third of the amount the DOE projects will be needed for US reactors by 2030.TerraPower, for example, said it will need 15 tonnes of HALEU for the first fuel load of its advanced reactor.Other potential HALEU producers are further behind.French state-owned uranium mining and enrichment company Orano says it could start producing HALEU in five to eight years, but will only apply for a production licence once it has customers with long-term contracts.In a response to a DOE request for information about how to establish a programme to support HALEU production, Orano said it would be down to the US government to kick-start the industry.""Orano's assessment shows that the single most important factor enabling success is the DOE guaranteeing a certain volume of demand,"" the company said in a statement on its website.European uranium enrichment company Urenco, meanwhile, says it is considering sites in the United States and Britain for HALEU production but has yet to apply for licences.For TerraPower and X-energy, which have projects planned in the U.S. states of Wyoming and Washington respectively, the clock is ticking.Washington awarded them contracts to build two demonstration rectors by 2028 and shared the costs. But without Russian fuel, that deadline will fall well before any alternative commercial suppliers would be up and running.While the 20% enrichment levels for HALEU are well below the roughly 90% level needed for weapons, companies need special licences to produce it. Additional security and certification requirements are also required for production sites, packaging and transportation of the fuel.To speed up the process and break the deadlock, the US government is looking to ""downblend"" weapons-grade highly enriched uranium sitting in its stockpile, though that will also take time.The US government said in 2016 it had downblended 7.1 tonnes between Sept. 30, 2013 and March 31, 2016. Asked this month whether the process had become any faster, the DOE said: ""Downblending rates are consistently evaluated for acceleration opportunities.""The Inflation Reduction Act US President Joe Biden signed in August contained $700 million to secure HALEU supplies from the government and a consortium partnered with the DOE for use in advanced reactors and research.In September, the White House asked Congress for another $1.5 billion in a temporary government funding bill to boost domestic supply of low enriched uranium and HALEU, to address potential difficulties in accessing Russian fuel.Lawmakers took the measure out of the bill over concerns about costs, though it remains a priority for some Biden officials, including Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.Last year, nuclear power stations in the United States imported about 14% of their uranium from Russia, along with 28% of their enrichment services, according to the US Energy Information Administration."
/tech-startup/news/amazon-faces-us-1-billion-lawsuit-uk-favouring-its-own-products-3147871,Amazon faces US $1 billion lawsuit in UK for 'favouring its own products' ,"E-commerce giant Amazon.com is facing a lawsuit in Britain for damages of up to US $1 billion over allegations that the online marketplace abused its dominant position by favouring its own products, lawyers said.Consumer rights advocate Julie Hunter plans to bring the collective action on behalf of British consumers who have made purchases on Amazon since October 2016, lawyers representing her said.The proposed case, which Amazon said was ""without merit"", would be the latest mass action against a tech giant to be filed at London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).Law firm Hausfeld, which represents Hunter, said on Thursday that Amazon has breached competition law by using a secretive and self-favouring algorithm to promote its own products through the Buy Box feature on its website.Hunter said in a statement: Far from being a recommendation based on price or quality, the Buy Box favours products sold by Amazon itself, or by retailers who pay Amazon for handling their logistics. Other sellers, however good their offers might be, are effectively shut out.An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement: This claim is without merit and were confident that will become clear through the legal process.The lawsuit is expected to be filed at the CAT by the end of this month and will have to be certified by the tribunal before it can proceed.It is being brought on an opt-out basis, meaning that any potential claimants will be included in the claim unless they choose to opt out.The case follows the announcement by Britain's antitrust watchdog in July that it is investigating Amazon over suspected breaches of competition law, including how it selects which products are placed within the Buy Box feature.Amazon has faced similar probes elsewhere, recently making an offer to the European Commission to avert possible hefty EU antitrust fines.The platform has also declined to describe its product-search system to an Australian competition regulator which has heard complaints of large marketplace platforms giving preference to in-house wares.The CAT authorised an estimated US $1.1 billion (920 million-pound) damages claim against Google in July and approved another case worth up to 1.7 billion pounds against Apple in May.The tribunal is also due to decide in January whether to give the go-ahead to a claim valued at up to 2.2 billion pounds against Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, over alleged anti-competitive behaviour.Google and Apple deny the allegations against them, according to court filings, and Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment."

The port can currently allow only those vessels having a draft of a maximum of 9.5 metres to moor.Talks on the Bay Terminal project began in 2011 with the emergence an 11km-long natural island from the seabed near the Halishahar coast, which raised hopes that a natural channel for vessel movement could be created.The CPA officials said the natural island would be developed to form a breakwater to protect the port channel from strong waves while dredging was required for enhancing its depth.  "

Senior party leaders are expected to join the event.Zakir Hossain Biplob, general secretary of Khulna Motor Sramik Union, said no buses would operate on Friday and Saturday if the government did not take any step to take Nasimons, Karimons, Mahendras and easybikes off the roads by today.The labor union expressed solidarity with the decision of the owners' association, he told The Daily Star yesterday.Khulna District Bus, Minibus, Coach Owners' Association and Khulna Motor Workers' Union on Tuesday night jointly decided that no buses will operate on 18 routes from Sonadanga Bus Terminal in the city for those two days if their demand was not met by Thursday.Shafiqul Alam Mana, convener of Khulna City BNP, said although attempts were being made to foil Saturday's rally, tens of thousands of party men were preparing to join the event defying all obstacles.Speaking at a press conference at the party office on the city's KD Ghosh Road yesterday, he alleged that 53 leaders and activists of the BNP and its associate bodies were arrested and detained in Khulna and Bagerhat ahead of the rally.Meanwhile, Jashore police allegedly detained 17 BNP leaders and activists yesterday, reports our Benapole correspondent.Delwar Hossain Khokon, joint convener of Jashore District BNP, said, ""We are preparing to assemble more than 50,000 people from Jashore for the Khulna rally. The police are detaining our leaders and activists in a planned way to prevent our leaders and activists from joining the meeting.""In the capital, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said his party was ready to defy even a curfew to make the Khulna rally a success.He made the remarks in the wake of the transport strike, reports UNB.""They [government] had stopped the movement of vehicles in Mymensingh, but failed to stop the people [from joining the rally]. You will see people will join the Khulna rally in the same way to press home their demand for democracy, no matter whether the transport service is suspended or not,"" he told reporters at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office after holding talks with two political parties.Fakhrul said people travelled to the Mymensingh rally by trawlers, boats, rickshaws, and also on foot. ""This is called people's participation.""The BNP held its first divisional rally in Chattogram and the second one in Mymensingh as part of organising 10 rallies of its divisional units protesting the price hike of essentials and fuel, recent killings of five party men in police firing in Bhola, Narayanganj, Munshiganj and Jashore, and also ""demanding release"" of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia.The programme will conclude with a rally in the capital on December 10.Our correspondents in Khulna and Benapole contributed to this report."

Intern doctors are starting their duties in a short time in the necessary areas, including the emergency department,"" said Imran, reports our Rajshahi staff correspondent.All the intern doctors will join work by withdrawing the strike completely by tomorrow morning, he added.KGM Shahriar, a fourth-year student of marketing department of Rajshahi University, was injured after falling from the third floor of Shaheed Habibur Rahman Hall on RU campus last night. He died while undergoing treatment at RMCH around 9:00pm.Alleging negligence in Shahriar's treatment, his classmates started protesting and vandalising RMCH. At that time, some intern doctors and hospital staff reportedly beat up the protesting students.The intern doctors left the hospital at 12:00am in protest against the attack and vandalism. Patients and relatives suffered due to the strike.Meanwhile, the hospital authorities have lodged a complaint with police in connection with the attack and vandalism of the students.Brig Gen Shamim Yazdani, director of the hospital, told The Daily Star, ""Our acting administrative officer Anwar Hossain filed a complaint with Rajpara Police Station in connection with the vandalism.

/daily-star-books/news/contradictions-book-the-bangladesh-liberation-war-3147461,Contradictions in a book on the Bangladesh Liberation War,"""The historian's problem is to discover what it really was that happened. And he deals with it by offering an explanation of the form"", wrote William Dray of the University of Toronto in the last century.Very few books on the history of the Liberation War of Bangladesh have been based on extensive research to explain the ""what it actually was"". Most of them are based on interviews or memoirs, the latter often transcribed by a third person. Chandrashekhar Dasgupta's India and the Bangladesh Liberation War (Juggernaut, 2021) promises to be one of the few countable outliers.The front blurb raises the questions: Did India have a plan to break up Pakistan? When and why did it involve itself with the Bangladesh freedom struggle? Did India ""win the war but lose the peace"" by signing the Simla Agreement?Dasgupta concludes: Indira Gandhi and her principal aide, Haksar, could not match the theoretical sophistication of their American counterparts, Nixon and Kissinger. But they ""achieved success"" by dint of their clear vision. Awami League's victory in the 1970 elections gave rise ""to hope as well as apprehensions""  of the Indian policymakers. They feared that, if the Pakistan army decided to thwart the transition to democracy, a long-drawn-out guerilla war would pass under the control of China or India's own Naxalites.Yahya's decision to crush Bengali aspirations through a reign of terror was the death blow to the unity of Pakistan. It triggered a massive refugee exodus and increased India's security concern. And so India decided to help the freedom fighters, but an immediate march to Dhaka was ruled out, because the army had no such contingency plan. India wanted to end the liberation war before the year end so that Chinese intervention or UN-imposed ceasefire would not divert it. India had no grand strategy from before but they marshalled all state power to create a coordinated ad-hoc plan.The main war-strategy did not include capturing Dhaka. Only at a very late stage was that aim included in the war-plan by Lt General Jacob.This book comprises 18 years of research. However, some parts of it question the credibility of the research.In the chapter, ""Indian reactions–January 1971"", Dasgupta describes the doubts in the minds of the policymakers. He writes that the senior Ministry of External Affairs officials and RAW were divided on the issue of the separation of East Pakistan. In a meeting of senior diplomats and intelligence officers on January 6, 1971, ""[o]nly the head of the Pakistan division (of MEA), Asoke Ray, agreed with Kao (head of RAW) to support the Bengali regulars declaring for independence"". The discord in the meeting was definitely no ""documentary evidence"".Then there is the question of whether India was entitled by law to give military assistance to the Bangladeshi guerillas—a point that has been raised in Cases and Materials on International Law by David Harris (Thomson Reuters, 2010).  An International Court of Justice report in 1972 concluded that India's attack on Pakistan under the doctrine of self-defence is not justified. But India could act on humanitarian grounds as the large-scale violation of human rights in East Pakistan created a continuous and unbearable refugee problem in India.Dasgupta himself quotes Swaran Singh's speech in the Security Council: ""International Law requires that where a mother state has irrevocably lost the allegiance of such a large section of its people . . . and cannot bring them under its sway, conditions for the separate existence of such a State come into being"".  All these nullify Haksar's point. Yet Dasgupta accepts Haksar's explanation without any mention of these, proving his research biassed.Most writers of books on the 1971 war have considered the day of surrender of the Pakistani army as the last day of the war. Dasgupta gives a detailed, day to day account of the signing of Simla Agreement.A ""what it really was"" analysis of the 1971 war does not mean the description of the actions of India only. It should also cover their mistakes and failures. The cover of this book claims to be a ""definitive story"", but its research and narrative are not holistic.Kazi Zawad is a former Senior Producer at BBC Bangla.

In 2003, the man opened an organisation called ""Janata Multipurpose Cooperative Society"" at his area in Kushtia.Ten years later, Khandaker Abul Kalam Azad changed the organisation's name to ""Janata Sanchay o Rindan Samabay Samity Limited"" and started operations on a large scale, targeting people from lower-income backgrounds in various upazilas of Kushtia, Khulna, Magura, Jhenidah, Pabna, Sirajganj and Rajshahi.At one point in 2017, Azad closed the company, after embezzling about Tk 70 crore from customers, and went into hiding.With the money, he bought 15 bighas of land, a six-storey building and a brick-kiln in Kushtia, and 11 bighas of land in Rajshahi. Besides, he bought several luxury flats and cars in Dhaka's Uttara.At least 60 cases have been filed against him over fraudulence.

/opinion/views/no-strings-attached/news/why-people-want-leave-bangladesh-3147906,Why people want to leave Bangladesh,"A few days ago, I woke up to a disturbing message from a friend who had migrated to the US, ""You should really work on getting a second passport for all three of you."" A few years ago, I would have just laughed it off – as I have done many times when such suggestions have been thrown at me by paranoid expatriate Bangladeshis obsessed with the ""desher obostha bhalo na (things are not good in the home country)"" refrain. But now, I am beginning to wonder whether my decision to come back to live and work in my own country, to contribute in whatever miniscule way, was a mistake. So I texted back with a ghost emoji, ""You are scaring me, my friend."" Her reply, ""That's the idea. I want you to be scared.""I refrained from continuing the conversation because, honestly, I didn't want to hear why. I do not want to entertain the idea that the country I was born in, where I spent my childhood, adolescence and most of my adulthood, where my most intense emotions are enmeshed and where I discovered who I wanted to be, has suddenly become so full of odds that the only option is to leave. I wanted to be in denial.I do not want to believe that Dhaka is the seventh least liveable city or fourth among the 20 most unsustainable cities in the world. But then I spend three hours on average every day just to travel to and from my home, watching (from the luxury of my car) my fellow citizens trying to dodge as gusts of dust from unending development fly into their eyes, fill their lungs and threaten to choke them as they wait patiently for rickety, packed buses or sit in CNG auto-rickshaws, inhaling the black sooty emissions of unfit vehicles or, in a fit of resignation, deciding to brave walking on the broken, hazardous roads. The Air Quality Index regularly places Dhaka in the ""unhealthy"" category. Surprise, surprise.But seriously, should we just give up because of the traffic and ""a bit of dust""? The main reason why people think of leaving their homeland is because of the feeling of utter helplessness, of things falling apart – literally and figuratively. Underneath the grandeur of shiny new bridges, flyovers and metro rails, the souls are as battered and broken as the roads that carry them.A post by The Daily Star Opinion's Facebook page, asking how Bangladesh can prevent its brain drain, gives a glimpse of the reasons behind the despair. Lack of job opportunities, not enough income compared to the soaring cost of living – though these have always been catalysts for brain drain. But people commenting on the post cited the unprecedented levels of corruption and lack of accountability of the state and state organisations (especially the law enforcement agencies), the absence of rule of law, poor quality of education, and a general lack of social justice as reasons for wanting to leave.Corruption has always been part of the system in Bangladesh. But in recent times, rent-seeking is the name of the game in every sphere of life – whether it is to get a driver's licence, a teaching job or even a bed in a hospital ward. Corruption has eaten up our green space, wetlands and rivers, leaving behind ugly, concrete jungles. For the ordinary citizen, life is an endless, brutish struggle.Add to this the tribal, territorial approach of the politically connected, each claiming their little kingdoms, the ordinary citizen is left completely out of the equation. While thousands of crores of taka are laundered out of the country, the common taxpayers are asked about the source of every single taka they earn. While thousands of crores of taka have been gobbled up in delayed megaprojects, food inflation is causing people to forgo one, even two meals a day and their only sources of protein. And then thousands of crores of taka have gone to maintain private power plants for years on end, and now we can look forward to as many as six hours of load-shedding every day (in the less affluent areas, of course).It is not just our movement that has been abnormally curtailed by paralysing gridlocks. Laws have been passed and enforced to silence voices, lobotomise brains, and tell us we cannot say/write/post anything that may seem to challenge the authority or irk its underlings. Thus, we live in crippling fear of sinister eavesdroppers listening to our private conversations, of plainclothes or uniformed men in microbuses whisking us away into darkness and oblivion.And let's not forget the inconvenience of being a woman in a growingly misogynistic society where what I wear is the fodder for religious sermons, vitriolic YouTube discussions, and justification for hateful trolling and even physical assault. Meanwhile, the horrifying numbers keep piling up: 734 raped, 34 raped and killed, seven dying by suicide after rape, 152 murdered by husbands – all between January and September this year, according to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK). They keep piling up because the system has gone topsy-turvy, with all the power tilted on the side of the rapist, abuser or murderer, and nothing on the side of the victim. Everything has a price tag and can be bought, whether it is the refusal to take a case, manipulation of evidence or even filing a false case against the victim.Over the last three years, friends, colleagues and relatives have either left the country or are planning to leave. All they want is a normal life for themselves and their children. But the idea of leaving everything I know and love is too heartbreaking to ponder on. What will happen to all those left behind?I do not want to open the text my friend has sent me again. For now, I just want to stay with the delusion of things getting better, in blissful denial. Aasha Mehreen Amin is joint editor at The Daily Star.

/opinion/editorial/news/why-are-there-still-so-many-unfit-vehicles-3147761,Why are there still so many unfit vehicles?,"We are concerned to see the number of vehicles seeking fitness clearance dropping to a seven-year low, despite registration of new vehicles seeing a sharp rise over the last fiscal year. It should cause immediate alarm for the authorities, as it raises further concerns about Bangladesh's notorious transport sector. According to police reports, at least 3,186 people were killed and 3,500 injured in 3,776 road crashes in the first eight months of this year. Official numbers, however, are much lower than the estimates given by non-government organisations.Bangladesh has one of the highest fatality rates from road crashes in the world. And one of the reasons for this is the proliferation of unfit vehicles. With the number of vehicles without fitness clearance increasing, the possibility of more unfit vehicles plying the roads increases concomitantly. This means, the number of casualties from road accidents is likely to rise as well. Unfortunately, despite so many casualties as well as numerous protests – including a countrywide student-led movement in 2018 – against the terrible state of road safety in the country, the authorities have yet to take meaningful action to purge our roads of unfit vehicles, unlicensed drivers and other contributing factors that regularly endanger human lives.A possibility for why the number of vehicles without fitness clearance is rising is the complexity of getting the clearance in the first place. As with all government services, the procedure for getting fitness clearance is time-consuming, difficult, and often requires bribing officials and middlemen. Additionally, the amount of advance income tax (AIT) that a vehicle owner has to pay for fitness clearance rose nearly by 50 percent since July 1, 2021. The owner of a vehicle, between 1501cc to 2000cc, now has to pay Tk 50,000 as AIT – previously, it was Tk 30,000. The additional cost of getting a fitness clearance, according to BRTA officials, could have made a big difference over the last year.Even in 2020-21, when BRTA offices remained closed due to Covid-19 pandemic, the number of vehicles with fitness clearance was 6.75 lakh – higher than when BRTA offices were open. Presently, at least 5.42 lakh registered vehicles have been operating without the mandatory fitness clearance. Clearly, the number of vehicles seeking clearance has dropped off quite significantly. The authorities need to find out what exactly is causing this, and rectify the situation on an urgent basis.According to some BRTA officials, owners of certain types of vehicles such as human haulers and trucks have to bribe law enforcers and transport-sector leaders, even if they have fitness clearance. This may further discourage them to take any clearance test. This culture of bribery and mismanagement needs to change if we are to ensure that the system functions properly. Owners must be encouraged to get fitness clearances for their vehicles on time, and any impediment in their way must be removed."
/sports/sports-special/t20-world-cup-2022/news/joy-lanka-or-heartbreak-the-dutch-3147541,Joy for Lanka or heartbreak for the Dutch?,"A revitalised Sri Lanka's quest to the Super 12 hangs in the balance as they take on group-topper Netherlands at the GMHBA Stadium in Geelong, while Namibia face a feeble UAE in the final match of Group A in the T20 World Cup today.The Netherlands sit top with four points, while the other two realistic contenders for qualification -- Namibia and Sri Lanka -- are second and third respectively with two points each.Net run-rate is expected to play a major role in who goes through. The Dutch might not make it to the main stage if they lose to Sri Lanka and at the same time if Namibia win against UAE.Netherlands have the lowest net run-rate amongst the three expected to fight for qualification, while Namibia have the highest. So, in order to cement qualification, the Dutch find themselves in a must-win situation or else they will have to pray that Namibia lose to the UAE in the latter match.On the other hand, former champions Sri Lanka, who are playing in the group-stage for the first time, find themselves in a sudden-death situation quite early on in the tournament, surely an unfamiliar territory for the current Asia Cup champions.The Lankans, who have had a serious buff to their net run-rate following their 79-run win over UAE, have made a turnaround and a win against the Dutch would surely take them through to the Super 12.Sri Lanka and Netherlands have faced each other on two occasions previously, both times it was in a T20 World Cup. Despite the two wins in their record book, Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka pointed out the unfamiliarity and unpredictability of facing an associate nation in a sudden-death situation""Rather than playing well-known countries, it is somewhat different playing against these nations. We don't know what exactly comes at us,"" Shanaka said on Wednesday. ""Normally, when you play against the Test-playing nations, we know the bowlers and combinations they play. There are advantages and disadvantages both when we play this kind of rounds.""For Namibia, it has been an up-and-down start. They toppled Sri Lanka in their opening fixture but were edged by Netherlands in the second match.The African nation also are in a must-win situation if they are to qualify and UAE seem to offer the perfect opportunity for them to not only win but better their net run-rate in the process, leaving no question for qualification."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/the-peripheral-breath-fresh-air-sci-fi-fans-3147676,‘The Peripheral’ is a breath of fresh air for Sci-Fi fans,"Produced by the same folks who made the science-fiction smash series Westworld (2016 to present), The Peripheral is based on the 2014 novel of the same name by the ever-prescient William Gibson, whose musings on cyberspace, artificial intelligence and other technologies often predict the real thing.Starring Chloe Grace Moretz as a young woman who gets more than she bargains for after playing a hyper-realistic simulation game, the show explores the tantalising possibilities of inhabiting a body other than your own – and other juicy concepts.Here are three reasons to stream it:Flynne Fisher (Moretz) feels trapped in her small North Carolina town.Her dead-end job barely covers her mother's medical bills, so she occasionally helps brother Burton (Jack Reynor) play video games for money – and somewhat reluctantly, even though she excels at it.When she takes over his avatar to test a cutting-edge virtual-reality headset for a secretive company, it plunges her into an action-adventure simulation like no other – thrilling, sexy and violent, and set in a futuristic London that feels uncannily real.Flynne is hooked – and so is the viewer – during her first heart-pounding London foray, which will appeal to gamers and James Bond fans alike.But things take a turn for the strange when she logs out, and she and Burton soon find themselves in grave danger.Like the best science fiction, The Peripheral can be enjoyed simply as an action adventure, but then you would miss out on its many intellectual pleasures, such as pondering the ethics of having multiple selves.No one does near-future crystal ball-gazing quite like Gibson, so there are plenty of meaty technological what-ifs to sink one's teeth into.London never looked so beautiful – the show was shot on location but overlaid with haunting special effects.And for all its big ideas, The Peripheral is adept at lingering on smaller moments filled with tension, existential dread or a surprising human connection."

/daily-star-books/news/what-i-write-about-when-i-write-love-stories-3147486,What I write about when I write love stories,"A long time ago, when I was a young writer who had just published his first collection of short stories and had just been married to a young and lovely woman, I wrote a love story in the first person, which created two unanticipated problems.First, my wife stopped talking to me, and second, some of my friends who read the story accused me of humiliating the whole community of Bengali Muslims, being that the protagonist of the story, a Bangladeshi Muslim boy, fell in love with a Hindu girl from West Bengal, India, who disrespected his love.Set at a university in Moscow during the final days of the Soviet Union, the story describes the complex relationship between the Bangladeshi boy from a middle-class Muslim background and the Indian girl from a Hindu upper caste and elite (Brahmin) family. This family had been forced to migrate to West Bengal as a result of the bloody communal Hindu-Muslim conflicts and the subsequent partition of India in 1947. Their forefathers were from the same area of East Bengal (now Bangladesh) but with very different religious, economic, and social statuses.To my wife, the story was very plausible evidence of my ""loose"" character. To my friends, it was humiliating for Bengali Muslims because the Bangladeshi protagonist was portrayed as a coward and a defeated character, a product of the author's ""imagined"" inferiority complex.I promised my wife that I would never again write love stories in the first person singular, and then broke that promise again and again: I kept writing. Once they were published, I never reflected on them or tried to analyse them further.But just a few days ago, when I was told to talk at a panel discussion about writing (or not writing) about love, I started looking back at my stories with an analytical eye and discovered that they were stories not about love but some other emotions and behaviours; some basic, intuitive, organic, crude, raw, and straightforward, some cultivated, subtle and complex. The above story was a tale of romantic infatuation and hereditary/racial prejudices.A few years after I wrote that story, I wrote a novel. The main protagonist was a powerful female character who had divorced her husband for the sake of her professional career (she was a diplomat). Then she fell in love (or so she claimed) with a journalist, a gentleman of quiet and meek personality, whose wife had abandoned him.They marry, but soon after the wedding, the gentleman starts un-enjoying his wife's dominating behaviour, which he used to enjoy before they were married when he used to call her ""my queen,"" without anticipating that this romantic queen might turn into a real tyrant.However, the marriage does not break, primarily because the husband, a naturally meek and submissive person, realises that he should be more accommodating than his wife. She is naturally dominant and cannot help her nature. But his ego refuses to recognise his submissiveness as a defeat and comforts itself with this philosophy: jey shohe, shey rohey, meaning, those who endure, win.So you see, this is not just a story about sincere or pretended love, but about a cold war between two intelligent, cultivated, modern human beings. Most of my short stories and novels about male-female relationships are like this. I did not write them this way; I don't enjoy writing about conflict or combat; they become like this naturally, as if following the natural laws of the worlds I create. And so I came to wonder why: why are my love stories full of all imaginable emotions except love?And—is it so?Then I found a story that I wrote more than 25 years ago, where I found love. It was set in a very remote village in Bangladesh, where the people were very poor, malnourished, illiterate, superstitious and simple, like primitives. A poor young man marries a poorer girl; they love each other more than anything else in the world, so they are happy despite abject poverty. And then, one day, the girl fell sick with some flu, and there was no doctor, no medicine, and the food they usually ate to survive, rice, was impossible for her because she lost her appetite.Desperate to help his wife in any possible way, the husband keeps telling her, ""You need to eat! You need to eat! What do you wish to eat?"" She names a kind of small fish found in the paddy fields and small ponds around the village. The husband runs off with a fishing net in his hands and after a while, comes back with a few fish to find his beloved wife dead. But he doesn't cry; he stays silent for a while and then says to his dead wife, ""Stupid woman! If you were going to die, why did you ask me to go fishing? Why didn't you say, stay beside me?"" Then the night comes. He goes to bed, falls asleep, and dies.I think stories like this can only be imagined in those types of societies, where modernity has not yet reached, and the human soul has not been contaminated by ""civilisation"". Romantic relationships between men and women in modern societies have lost the innocence essential to making a ""love story"" a story about love in the true sense.Edited by Shabnam Nadiya

/opinion/project-syndicate/news/wars-arent-won-peacetime-economies-3147846,Wars aren’t won with peacetime economies,"Politically, the G7 and like-minded countries around the world have adopted a war footing to stop Russian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin violated the most fundamental principle of international law by launching an attack on another member of the United Nations – an institution created explicitly to prevent such aggression. The dangers of appeasement should be obvious. Even a little empathy should make us shudder in horror at the prospect of having to live under Putin's rule. It is a peculiar war. While Putin has described his project as a confrontation with the entire West, Ukrainians alone are doing all the fighting and bearing the full brunt of Russian attacks. Meanwhile, Europe and America have provided economic and military assistance, and the rest of the world has been dealing with the war's fallout, including higher energy and food prices.But it is a mistake to think that the war can be won with a peacetime economy. No country has ever prevailed in a serious war by leaving markets alone. Markets simply move too slowly for the kind of major structural changes that are required. Wars inevitably cause shortages and generate windfall gains for some at the expense of others. Historically, war profiteers have typically been executed. But today, they include many energy producers and traders who, rather than being marched to the gallows, should be subjected to a windfall profits tax. The European Union has proposed such a measure, but it would come too late, and it is too weak and too narrow for the challenge at hand. Similarly, while several members of the US Congress have put forward bills to tax Big Oil's superprofits, the Biden administration has so far failed to move on the issue. That is understandable, given that US President Joe Biden has been busy enlisting support for signal achievements like the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. Moreover, in seeking the private sector's cooperation in limiting price increases, he has been at pains not to appear ""anti-business."" But taxing windfall profits and using the proceeds to finance the necessary war spending and support for those hurt by high prices is not anti-business; it is responsible wartime governance, which is necessary to maintain popular support for the war effort. Even more comprehensive measures are needed in Europe, where today's electricity market was not designed to deal with wartime conditions. Instead, it follows the principle of marginal-cost pricing. That means the electricity price reflects the highest-cost source of production needed to meet current demand. As fuel prices have soared, marginal costs have risen far above average costs. The cost of renewable energy has, for instance, changed little. As such, many sellers of low-cost electricity are making a killing, as are the traders who bought energy at the lower pre-war prices. While these market players reap billions of euros in profits, consumers' electricity bills are soaring. Electricity prices in energy-rich Norway, with its enormous gas and oil reserves and hydro capacity, have increased nearly tenfold. Meanwhile, households and small businesses are being pushed to the brink, and even some big companies have already gone bankrupt. The European principle of ""no state aid"" has been thrown aside, mainly because European leaders moved too slowly in changing a market structure that was not designed for war. Economists love marginal-cost pricing because it provides appropriate incentives, and because its distributive consequences tend to be small and easily manageable in normal times. But now, the system's incentive effects are small and its distributive effects are enormous. In the short run, consumers and small businesses will have to turn down their thermostat in the winter and turn it up in the summer, but comprehensive energy-saving investments take time to plan and implement. Fortunately, there is a simpler system that would retain most of marginal-cost pricing's incentive effects without the distributive effects. Under a non-linear pricing framework, households and firms could be allowed to purchase 90 percent of their previous year's supply at the previous year's price, and 91-110 percent of supply at, say, 150 percent of the previous year's price, before the marginal-cost price kicks in. While non-linear pricing can't be used in many markets – owing to the possibility of ""arbitrage"" (buying a good at a low price and immediately reselling it at a much higher price) – electricity is not one of them. That is why some economists have long advocated its use in cases where large market failures are having important distributive effects. It is a powerful tool that governments can and should use, especially when confronting wartime conditions. Such changes have become imperative. As the Vietnamese understood, wars are won as much on the political front as on the battlefield. The purpose of the 1968 Tet Offensive was not to gain territory but to change the political calculus of the war, and it worked. Defeating Russia obviously will require more help for Ukraine. But it will also require a better economic response on the part of the West more broadly. That starts with sharing more of the burden through windfall profit taxes, controlling key prices – such as those for electricity and food – and encouraging government interventions where necessary to alleviate critical shortages. Neoliberalism, based on simplistic ideas about how markets should operate that fail to comprehend how they actually operate, didn't work even in peacetime. It must not be allowed to stop us from winning this war. Joseph E Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics, is professor at Columbia University and a member of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation."

With a population of 16.5 crore, the nation has seen a 6.15 per cent expansion in its gross domestic product on average since 2000.""Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India are expected to see the biggest increase in consumer spending in the current decade,"" said the report.The sectors that reflect considerable growth in Bangladesh are insurance, photographic and computer equipment, imputed rental and housing, package holidays and recreational items, vehicle purchase, and financial services, it added.Bangladesh's consumer market will see more than 7 per cent growth annually from 2021 to 2030, said the report, which was prepared last month.China, India, and the US will continue to be the top three consumer markets by 2030 as they were in 2021. However, Brazil will lose its fourth position to Indonesia by then. Korea and Japan will also see a drop in the overall market by 2030.The report forecasts that over the next few decades, the world, and Asia in particular will undergo significant demographic shifts.As for Asia, the region will become considerably older, and wealthier, and households will continue to get smaller. These changes result in significant shifts in spending patterns across Asia.""Asia will become the dominant player in global consumer markets,"" it said.The number of people spending $21-50 a day is rising rapidly in India. In China, more people are moving into the upper-income bracket, which represents the group that spends more than $111 per day.In Asia, the middle-class population is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 2.1 per cent until 2040.

Conversely, food expenditure is expected to see its lowest growth at just 5 per cent over the same period.As for Bangladesh, the report said, the annual expenditure growth for transport is likely to be the highest, over 8 per cent, followed by housing, water, and fuel."

/shout/news/experiencing-architecture-around-us-3147426,Experiencing architecture around us,"A space is more than a vicinity that shelters us. It morphs our emotions, helps our thoughts take shape, carves out a pathway to meet like-minded people, and creates communities. We spend a large fraction of our lives indoors, which impacts us in ways we don't even realise. Such is the pedigree of a discipline that is forged by culture and society. The application of architecture isn't merely to keep track of our physical footprints, it is a practice that is also meant to address our needs. By building on existing values and having them interweave with the contemporary, architecture, in turn, also shapes culture and society.Whether to represent royalty, protect from harsh climates, or spark awe, architecture has always been emblematic of its time, location, and climate. Igloos are built with ice due to their low thermal conductivity and accessibility in the region. Japanese and Chinese architectural identities overlap due to their connection to Buddhism. The Taj Mahal utilises concepts of symmetry as well as rational and strict geometry to perpetuate the notion that Mughal leadership is flawless. A closer look at Dhaka and the parallels between the city and the livelihood of its people float to the surface. An urban jungle, lined with grey cement blocks as far as the eye can see. No corner is spared. Does it all stand to represent that people are trying to just get by? As morbid as this outlook might be, I am certain I am not the only one who bears it.Nuren Iftekhar, a Dhaka University graduate currently working as a teacher abroad, shares his views. ""Dhaka often feels like a canvas that different artists tried to paint on at the same time. A canvas that then got painted over by an amateur mason,"" he says. ""Functionality has far outpaced the sense of beauty or cohesion. A walk through my area only shows apartments whose sole purpose is to hold as many people as the zoning board approves. Wide stretched balconies have been replaced by tiny alcoves with the sole purpose of drying clothes.""Rashed H. Chowdhury, the principal architect at Dehsarworks, highlights the significance of architecture on the zeitgeist. ""A built environment is the result of all our collective effort and thoughts. While architects are the ones designing the spaces, they are responding to the needs of society. The projects also affect our conscious minds. The cause and effect go hand-in-hand.""""The primary identifier of any nation is its architectural landmarks, and I believe it is a visible envelope of our society,"" he said.A building, even with its ornamental exterior and grand scale, is only as good as the amenities of the interior. If the space inside fails to fulfil its function, then by no means does it qualify as good design. By carefully curating the right forms, colours, shapes, light, and proportions, designers can influence how an occupant might feel.""If anyone is stuck in a room that isn't exposed to natural light, has the same temperature throughout the day, and boasts no tangible change in the interior, it creates fatigue amongst its occupants,"" asserts Rashed.Iftekhar recalls what stood out to him about the design of Curzon Hall, where he attended classes in university. ""Perhaps the most noticeable aspect of Curzon hall was the uniformity. From the old halls to the newly established buildings, it is present everywhere. Even the Zoology building, with its separate colour scheme, felt like an extension of the original architectural vision. Any deviation from it feels jarring which is evident in the newer buildings. Despite having better accommodation, they never evoked the same feeling that Curzon hall did,"" he said.   Subah Shaheen, Manager at Robi Axiata Limited, discusses the use of symbolism in her workplace, ""Our workplace has a great interior. There are words and icons dispersed throughout the walls on each floor, representing the core values, visions and objectives of the company. This not only reinforces what we hear in meetings and townhalls but is a constant reminder throughout the day about what we are trying to achieve and why.""There is evidence that using certain elements in the interior will evoke a specific kind of ambience and mood. Furthermore, a building serves a wide variety of needs of many different people. Even then, the space must serve more than one purpose for each individual Therefore, it really isn't feasible to predict how one might respond to their environment.Iftekhar comments on how the architecture of Dhaka University and Curzon Hall makes him feel. ""The first thing that Curzon hall evoked in my mind as I first stepped foot there as a freshman was grandeur. As cliched as it sounds, the wide hallway, the old arches and the red bricks gave it a sense of timelessness.""""Having a common space in every floor creates an opportunity for social interaction within the office. The space enables employees to have important discussions, enjoy a game of foosball, and does wonders to help relax during the day. It also helps us save time as you don't have to get out of the office to unwind,"" said Subah about her workplace.New spaces must be designed to meet various needs. However, what appears to have taken precedence are economic benefits. Allowing capitalistic interests to dictate urban planning causes efficiency to trump empathy for the people. In the process, citizens are left stuck with a lack of open spaces, poorly designed footpaths, and a monotonous cityscape. Urban planners and policymakers must instil changes that account for the welfare of the people.In a write-up for The Grudging Urbanist titled ""There is just one way to save Dhaka"", Adnan Zillur Morshed, renowned architect, architectural historian, and urbanist, attributed the capital's rampant traffic crisis to a lack of land-use planning. ""We allowed the city to become an untenable urban juggernaut, an infernal urban agglomeration, paying little attention to how the city's land could be developed with a logical sequence of use and zoning,"" he says.He urges that Dhaka undertake land-use planning – a system that opts for areas to facilitate schools, grocery shops, malls and other venues for recreation within walking distance of the residents. As a result, it will eliminate the need to travel long distances and reduce congestion within the city.""I think what can really help the capital embrace openness is to first improve public transport. Discouraging the use of personal vehicles and harbouring collective commute is vital. It bunches people up and frees up space. The prospect of being a part of a community should be cherished and design should enable that. The fabric of the city should be people-centric,"" remarked Rashed.Nonetheless, what plagues much of Dhaka is the invasion of open spaces. Footpaths are occupied, fields are a parading ground for local politicians, seasonal melas, or construction sites, and due to the steep climb in the rate of urbanisation, water bodies are at risk because of housing accommodations.While it will generate employment in the tertiary sector, create new forms of income, and help the economy, this approach is myopic. Natural resources are compromised and historical landmarks are destroyed all for the sake of ""development"". What gets overlooked, as a result, are other problems that will have to be tackled in the future. If the correct measures are not taken now, the benefits of the present will merely be consolation.An architect can let all the principles of design guide them but a design that is not centred around people is a design that will inevitably fail. Spaces are social spheres, grounds for igniting important conversations and inspiring change. A city that breeds unhappiness is a place that is waiting to fall apart. To nourish it is to let its inhabitants thrive. It is time we let consciousness spearhead architecture and design.   Rashed Chowdhury is hopeful about the future of architecture. He believes what allows it to thrive and makes it a promising field is the vastness, scope of innovation, geopolitical nature of Bangladesh and the spirit of youth.""Unlike anywhere else in the world, Bangladeshi architecture incorporates a lot of diversity. Due to the reform having grey area, we are allowed to venture out and explore,"" he concludes.Abir Hossain is a sub-editor at SHOUT, The Daily Star. Reach him at abir.hossain@thedailystar.net

During an unlikely time, the Jamuna has swelled up and in turn devoured homesteads, croplands and schools in Chowhali upazila of Sirajganj in the last one week. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Already two primary schools went underwater in the last three days, while three more schools remain at risk of erosion. The schools under risk are currently being moved to different locations.
Md Jahangir Firoz, Chowhali upazila primary education officer, told this correspondent that two buildings, including the newly built two-storied building of Chandpur Government Primary School in Sodia Chandpur Union, submerged in the Jamuna on Tuesday night.



Earlier, a tin-shed establishment of Rehai Moucha Primary School in the same union got submerged.
""Of the affected institutions, Char Muradpur Government Primary School already shifted its tin-shed building on Tuesday, while locals and teachers of Mituani Government Primary School have prepared to shift their school as well,"" said Jahangir.

The schools under risk are currently being moved to different locations.Md Jahangir Firoz, Chowhali upazila primary education officer, told this correspondent that two buildings, including the newly built two-storied building of Chandpur Government Primary School in Sodia Chandpur Union, submerged in the Jamuna on Tuesday night.Earlier, a tin-shed establishment of Rehai Moucha Primary School in the same union got submerged.""Of the affected institutions, Char Muradpur Government Primary School already shifted its tin-shed building on Tuesday, while locals and teachers of Mituani Government Primary School have prepared to shift their school as well,"" said Jahangir.Tofazzal Hossain, a senior teacher at Char Mituani Government Primary School said, ""The river is swelling fast with great intensity. We are trying hard to shift the school as soon as possible...""""Ours is a school of around 200 students. Most of the students, along with the teachers, have stopped coming to school amid the looming threat of river erosion,"" he added.However, Primary Education Officer Jahangir Firoz said the five erosion-hit schools have around 1,000 students, and efforts are on to keep the academic activities ongoing.""We have already ordered the schools to hold classes in safe places so that the academic activities are not hampered,"" he said.Chowhali UNO Afsana Yeasmin said this is an unlikely time for the river to swell. However, the Jamuna has swelled up in the last few days and the situation is growing increasingly serious at every turn.""We have asked all the chairmen in the upazila to prepare a list of erosion victims,"" said the UNO.Contacted, Milton Hossain, sub-divisional engineer of Sirajganj Water Development Board, said due to excessive rain in the upstream of the river in India, the Jamuna has seen an increased level of water.""We have already taken urgent steps to protect erosion-hit areas,"" he said."
/opinion/editorial/news/another-wasteful-railway-project-3147811,Another wasteful railway project,"We are quite unconvinced about the recent initiative taken by Bangladesh Railway to repair 20 sets of Demu (diesel-electric multiple unit) trains – bought from a Chinese company in 2013 at the cost of Tk 600 crore – that have gone out of order. While the trains were supposed to run for at least 35 years, they became non-functional within 7 years of operation due to lack of maintenance. Reportedly, railway officials couldn't fix them because they didn't have the necessary technology and knowhow to do it. It was also found to be very expensive to get them repaired by the company that supplied them.However, recently, a team of local engineers repaired one set of trains by replacing the imported technologies with local ones. The success has apparently made railway authorities interested in similarly repairing all the Demu trains. The question is, will that be cost-effective and sustainable in the long run? And why did the trains become inoperative within just seven years?According to sources at Bangladesh Railway, the total cost of repairing one set of trains may be over Tk 1 crore. This means that over Tk 20 crore would have to be spent to make them all functional again. But what guarantee is there that the plan will work this time? Will it be worth the money and effort? It is, however, good to know from the railway minister that they will take the decision after monitoring the performance of the repaired trains. That should indeed be the case, because repairing all at once at such a huge cost would only be rational if they can run for many years and turn profits for the railway.Needless to say, buying these high-tech trains without ensuring the necessary support system was a big mistake on the part of the railway. Reportedly, eight government officials, including some from the railway ministry, went to China to evaluate these trains' performance and suitability for Bangladesh. Clearly, they did not do their job well. We think those involved in evaluating and purchasing these high-cost and high-maintenance trains must be held to account. Otherwise, such waste of public money in unnecessary projects cannot be stopped.It should be noted that, over the last decade, Bangladesh Railway has become a serial lossmaker. It has not made any profit since FY 2008-09. In the FY 2021-22 alone, it made a loss of around Tk 2,300 crore. While various projects have been taken up to improve its service, a majority of projects could not be completed on time or within budget, and the success of many that were completed was, like the Demu project, short-lived. This is quite unfortunate.We think the railway ministry must think carefully and critically before taking up such projects in the future, particularly at this time of a serious economic crisis. The authorities must also consider all possibilities before green-lighting the Demu repair project, and hold accountable all responsible for its initial failure."

If the UAE upset Namibia, the Dutch will progress.It is the third successive time Sri Lanka have reached the Super 12 and they will be hoping to repeat their heroics from 2014, when Dinesh Chandimal skippered them to the title.But it was a rocky road to get there, stunned by Namibia in the tournament's opening game before crushing UAE and now the Netherlands.After winning the toss and choosing to bat, Sri Lanka started slowly with Pathum Nissanka and Mendis plodding to just 22 off the first five overs.Nissanka was dropped in the fifth over, and came undone on 14 when hostile pace bowler Paul Van Meekeren returned to the attack and sent down a yorker.Dhananjaya de Silva followed him back to pavilion the next ball, out lbw, as Sri Lanka lived dangerously with countless chances falling just short of the fielders.Charith Asalanka and Mendis knuckled down in a 60-run stand to step up the run rate before Asalanka was caught behind off all-rounder Bas de Leede for 31.Mendis brought up his ninth T20 half-century with a six then smacked successive sixes in the penultimate over before he was out going for another boundary, almost carrying his bat.Despite missing injured pace spearheads Dushmantha Chameera and Pramod Madushan, a Sri Lankan attack with replacements Lahiru Kumara and Binura Fernando kept the Dutch at bay in the opening overs.Opener Vikramjit Singh was out for seven, caught by Dusan Shanaka off Maheesh Theekshana then Kumara got the big wicket of rising star De Leede for 14.The experienced Colin Ackermann went for a golden duck to the spin of Hasaranga de Silva as they reached 63-3 at halfway.Opener Max O'Dowd (71 not out) gamely hung on but when captain Scott Edwards was bowled by Fernando after a quick-fire 21 they slumped from 100-4 to 109-8 and the game was all-but over."

It found that South Asia is home to eight of the world's 20 most unsustainable megacities, with half of them in India alone.Dhaka is preceded by Kinshasa, Nairobi and Lagos, as per the report, while the rest of the cities include Baghdad, Lahore, Kolkata and Delhi.The report projected high population growth, over 50 percent, combined with other factors -- including high levels of air pollution, poor sanitation, high homicide rates and substantial ecological threats -- in the cities.Dhaka, Lahore, Kolkata, Delhi, Karachi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad are eight of the 20 cities facing the highest population growth and are the most vulnerable to ecological threats, it said.Produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), the report tracks the links between climate change, ecological threats, and violent conflict or forced migration each year.It revealed that at least 56 percent of countries and territories (127 out of 228) are facing catastrophic ecological threats.Bangladesh has seen 254 natural disasters since 1981, according to the report.For example, Dhaka, a city of 22.6 million people, is affected by ecological changes in several ways. It floods regularly; it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world; and the city struggles to deal with waste, said the report.Adil Mohammad Khan, former general secretary of the Bangladesh Institute of Planners, said every bit of the report regarding Dhaka is true. The situation is so dire that it hardly requires any study to understand the catastrophe the city dwellers deal with.""Every year, the city loses its greenery, parks and open spaces, exacerbating the environmental and ecological problems,"" he said.Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive officer of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, told The Daily Star that without saving greenery, transforming the transport sector and reforming Rajuk, Dhaka will continue to suffer in all indexes.From as early as 1991, Japan International Cooperation Agency has been stating that the city has failed to provide the appropriate number of parks and open spaces."
