/business/economy/news/knitwear-continues-dominance-export-3138516,Knitwear continues dominance in export,"The knitwear segment has retained its position as the country's biggest export earner in the readymade garment industry and among all the sectors of Bangladesh. But the journey has not been smooth.In its early years, it had to navigate through a quota system and securing raw materials was not easy as imports were the only option. Now it is facing mounting challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine.The knitwear segment overtook the woven sub-sector for the first time in the financial year of 2007-08 and held the pole position until 2010-11.The woven outran the knitwear segment in 2011-12 and the dominance continued till 2019-20.In 2020-21, knitwear outran woven and recaptured the glory. And it continued in the last fiscal year as well as it brought home $23.21 billion, versus the woven's $19.40 billion.Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector 


Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector Even in July to September, the first quarter of the current financial year when the overall export earnings showed a falling trend, the knitwear segment grew 9.40 per cent year-on-year to $5.64 billion because of a strong demand amid the raging war and unprecedented inflation in the eurozone and the US.Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector.Fast fashion and putting on casual dress have increased the use of knitwear items in the last one decade. Nowadays, even executives wear casual dresses at offices instead of formal ones. Knitwear like functional sportswear is used as dresses for formal events worldwide.Fashion connoisseurs prefer knitwear items since it is comfortable and easy to wash. Moreover, product diversification has taken place within the segment.When Covid-19 brought the entire world to a screeching halt and damaged the global supply chain severely and businesses hit rock bottom, the country's knitwear sector put on a good show, surprisingly, as Bangladesh kept supplying garment items to the world amid the raging flu.The segment also felt some damage.The slowdown in the knitwear shipment was first noticed in March 2020 when earnings stood at a paltry $1.05 billion. It fell further in April, to $180.2 million.But it rebounded in the following month as exporters fetched $608.38 million since people were forced to spend more time indoors to avoid catching the deadly virus. The receipts sprinted to $1.16 billion in June.""It was surprising that the demand for knitwear items started climbing even during Covid-19 when the global supply chain came to a standstill. In fact, knitwear export has continued to surge,"" said Md Fazlul Hoque, managing director of Plummy Fashions, a Narayanganj-based knitwear exporter.""The use of knitwear items has risen as consumers spent more time at home. During their long stay indoors, western consumers mostly use T-shirts.""Historically, the knitwear sector was groomed in Bangladesh because of the quota system which started in the late 1970s and was in place until 2004.In the early days, knitwear manufacturers, particularly those based in Narayanganj, used to ship knitwear items as the European Union granted the facility of a quota system that was not rigorous and was less cumbersome. So, a strong market was created for local knitwear items.In fact, Bangladesh made the most of the quota system, sowing the seed for today's gigantic knitwear industry.The EU and other developing and developed countries later eased the Rules of Origin for knitwear items, allowing the least-developed countries such as Bangladesh to qualify for the generalised system of preferences in the trade bloc even if imported cotton and yarn are used to ship export-oriented goods.This prompted knitwear producers to invest a lot of money in the sector and broaden their manufacturing prowess.Subsequently, entrepreneurs also pumped money to produce yarn and other raw materials for the knitwear sector.Currently, nearly 90 per cent of raw materials are procured from the local market, cutting reliance on China, a major feat for the industry as it more than halved the lead time.Even five years ago, the US was not a major market for knitwear manufacturers.""Today, the US has turned into a major export destination for us,"" said Hoque.Three years ago, the export of knitwear items from his factory to the US was almost zero whereas the world's biggest economy is his main buyer now.Mohammad Hatem, executive president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said demand for knitwear items has not fallen despite higher inflation in the eurozone and the US.Competitive prices are a major factor in Bangladesh's success in the knitwear sector.""The export of knitwear items has kept rising and the momentum will continue in the future as well,"" Hatem said.Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, expects the dominance of knitwear in exports to continue for the next few years as raw materials are easy to procure and the demand for casual wear has lifted the demand for knitwear products.Currently, more than 1,200 knitwear factories are in operation in Bangladesh, employing over 14.50 lakh workers."
/news/bangladesh/news/pricier-school-supplies-threaten-dropouts-northern-chars-3138526,Pricier school supplies threaten dropouts in northern chars,"Many children living on the impoverished Teesta river islands (chars) are getting closer to dropping out of school, owing to the rising cost of stationery items and study materials.Parents say they are already struggling to stay afloat due to rising prices of essentials. Now, they fear they will no longer be able to pay for their children's schooling.Getting an education in the char areas is as difficult as swimming against the tide and the rising cost just adds to the burden, they added.According to education experts, the learning loss that occurred during the pandemic caused irreparable damage to students.At present, dropout spike is expected in Nilphamari, Rangpur, Lalmonirhat and Kurigram schools.Last year, schools reopened after a 1.5-year closure. Since then, student attendance hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels.While primary education facilities may be found in some schools, higher education is still a far cry due to poverty-stricken inaccessibility.Chars are fleeting by nature, made from the ebbs and flows of silt. Not every char has a school and those that do, struggle to stay open. Like all char structures, schools are impermanent and need to be shifted often.Besides, teachers find it difficult to make the commute from the mainland, frequently missing classes.With only a few schools holding classes every day, students who want to attend from surrounding chars have to travel quite a distance.These challenges lead many to drop out. Girls get married off and boys find work to help with family expenses.While the government provides textbooks free of cost, without access to subsidised school supplies, it will be impossible to improve the literacy rate in the underprivileged char areas, education experts say.During visits to some shops in the districts, this correspondent found that prices had risen for all school supplies including school uniforms, shoes, bags, pens, pencils, erasers, sharpeners, markers, loose paper, notebooks, geometry boxes, plastic while boards, scales, calculators, and colouring pencils.The price of a rim of white paper used by students for making notebooks is now Tk 1,250, up from Tk 750 two months ago.Similarly, a rim of newsprint paper is being sold at Tk 1,150, up from Tk 700.Meanwhile, the price of ballpoint pens has risen by Tk 15-20 per dozen, and plastic whiteboards and geometric boxes are being sold at twice the price.Abdul Hadi (40), a rickshaw puller in Kurigram's Chilmari upazila, has child who's a Mondolerghat Govt Primary School student.He said, ""We have to cut back on meals in order to send my children to school.""Md Nuruzzaman (50), who's child goes to Purba Satunama Aminpara Govt Primary School at Satunama Char in Nilphamari's Dimla upazila, said, ""I couldn't afford a new pair of shoes and a bag for my child. The price of the cheapest pair of shoes is Tk 600 and an ordinary school bag is Tk 550, which were Tk 450 and Tk 300 just a few weeks ago.""Khalilur Rahman, the headmaster of Purba Satunama Aminpara Govt Primary School, said, ""The school has a total of 250 students, most of whom come from families who are river erosion victims. They come to class barefooted and without the necessary school supplies. We cannot but be understanding of their situation.""District Primary Education Officer Nobez Uddin Sarker, said, ""We request that the district administration increases monitoring in order to stop the syndicate responsible for the price hike of school supplies.""   "
/opinion/views/news/churchill-and-india-manipulation-or-betrayal-3138321,Churchill and India: Manipulation or betrayal?,"History is often written by the victor, and there can be no finer examples than Winston Churchill's books on the Second World War and British imperial stories, in which he played no small role. But truth cannot be seen from only one perspective. This is why Kishan Rana's book: ""Churchill and India: Manipulation or Betrayal"" (Routledge, 2022) is such an important contribution to an emerging global history different from just Euro-centric narratives. Superbly researched, Kishan connected the dots to find that Churchill's record on India reflected part of his own limited experience with Indians, formed through his leadership of Indian Muslim troops as part of his early career, and his grand, but often self-serving, view of world affairs from imperial London.Churchill was right on the Nazi German threat but flawed on resisting India's road to independence. The Last Lion could not stop the slow but unstoppable deterioration of the British Empire, not with the emergence of the United States, which wanted no rival. In the post-Second World War period, America actively ensured that European states shed their colonies so that none would be strong enough to challenge her dominant status. American hegemony remains a classic ""divide and rule"" strategy, learnt well from the British.Kishan's book chronicles the Indian context and perspectives, which were swept aside because Britain was pre-occupied with the European war. Distant colonies cannot be defended from imperial over-reach, so India was lucky that Japan was too pre-occupied by China and stretched managing the newly conquered South-east Asia to launch any full-scale invasion of South Asia. Subra Chandra Bose's Indian Independence Army, formed from Indian soldiers captured by the Japanese in the Malayan battle (one of the biggest disasters of British military history), marked a significant turning point in the Indian road to independence.Managing huge empires has monumental consequences, much of which has been swept under the carpet until Indian historians began digging deeper into the fiascos. The 1943 famine in Bengal, in which more than 2 million Indians starved to death, happened under Churchill's watch as prime minister. The India-Pakistan split (which Churchill encouraged) resulted in the displacement of 10-20 million people and loss of life estimated between several hundreds of thousands and 2 million. The historical facts that India's GDP remained in absolute terms roughly the same at USD 1 trillion, and declined from roughly one quarter of global GDP when Britain took over to only 4 percent of world GDP at the time of independence, speak volumes about Britain's inglorious management of her glorious empire. Historian Utsha Patnaik calculated that Britain gained USD 45 trillion in today's money from her stewardship or occupation of India.Kishan has done a great service to history by meticulously judging Churchill's record. For Britain, he was a faithful, loyal, even great servant. For India, under the yoke of empire, it is not so glorious. The colonised must suffer because they must, even if the coloniser betrayed their interests. This explains why India today is ""on her own side"", rather than the side of the North Atlantic allies, in the Ukraine War. Those who preached human rights, freedom and rule-based international order were all brutal former colonisers. War and invasion rightly should be condemned. But history remembers who did the invasions first. No power comes to the present with clean hands. Lord Acton was right – there are no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests.This is a book to be savoured, and like a true detective story, it tells the tale of great men with grand vision and their seemingly small faults. Andrew Sheng is a distinguished fellow at Fung Global Institute.

/health/news/microplastics-detected-the-1st-time-human-breast-milk-3138821,Microplastics detected for the 1st time in human breast milk,"Microplastics have been discovered for the first time in human breast milk, raising concerns among experts about the health consequences for infants.Infants are particularly sensitive to chemical pollutants, according to scientists, and further study is urgently needed.However, they emphasised that breastfeeding is still by far the best approach to nourish a baby, reports The Guardian.Breast milk samples were collected from 34 healthy mothers in Rome, Italy, a week after giving birth. Of them 75% had microplastics, reports The Guardian.Previous studies have demonstrated that microplastics are hazardous to human cell lines, lab animals, and marine species, but the impact on humans is unknown.Plastics frequently include hazardous compounds, such as phthalates, which have previously been detected in breast milk.The mothers' consumption of food and drink in plastic packaging, as well as seafood, was monitored, as was their usage of plastic-containing personal hygiene items. However, there was no link with the presence of microplastics. According to the researchers, the pervasive presence of microplastics in the environment ""makes human exposure unavoidable,"" however larger investigations in the future may reveal specific risk factors, said the report.The Italian team identified microplastics in human placentas in 2020. ""So the proof of microplastics' presence in breast milk increases our great concern for the extremely vulnerable population of infants,"" said Dr Valentina Notarstefano, at the Università Politecnica delle Marche, in Ancona, Italy.""It will be crucial to assess ways to reduce exposure to these contaminants during pregnancy and lactation,"" she said. ""But it must be stressed that the advantages of breastfeeding are much greater than the disadvantages caused by the presence of polluting microplastics. Studies like ours must not reduce breastfeeding of children, but instead raise public awareness to pressure politicians to promote laws that reduce pollution,"" Notarstefano said.Another recent study found that bottle-fed newborns are likely to consume millions of microplastics each day, and that cow's milk can include microplastics, it said.Massive amounts of plastic garbage are poured into the environment, and microplastics pollute the whole earth, from Mount Everest's top to the deepest oceans. The microscopic particles are consumed by food and water, as well as inhaled, and have been identified in the excrement of newborns and adults, it reported.The breast milk study, published in the journal Polymers, discovered microplastics made of polyethylene, PVC, and polypropylene, all of which are often found in packaging. The researchers were unable to analyse particles smaller than 2 microns in size, and smaller plastic particles are likely to exist. Plastics were not used to collect, store, or analyse the breast milk samples, and control samples were also processed to rule out contamination, the report also said.While specific microplastic risk factors were not discovered in this short study, Notarstefano said: ""We would like to advise pregnant women to pay greater attention to avoiding food and drink packaged in plastic, cosmetics and toothpastes containing microplastics, and clothes made of synthetic fabrics."""

I didn't know how many points I was going to get. I was happy with the race we had.""The race got off to a chaotic start in heavy rain, with Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and Williams' Alex Albon exiting on the first lap prompting a safety care.A red flag soon followed and forced the drivers to wait for more than an hour before the action restarted, again under a safety car.Verstappen resumed with a lead over Leclerc and Perez, and extended it as conditions gradually improved.Verstappen has won 12 of 18 races in 2022 and thanked his team for an ""incredible"" year.""The first (championship) is a little more emotional, the second one is beautiful,"" he said.""It's been a special year, and you need to remind yourself as these kind of years you don't have very often.""Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said Verstappen had ""grown"" as a driver.""Carrying that number one this year, he's done it with a lot of pride,"" he said."
/business/economy/news/pubali-bank-tear-3138496,Pubali Bank on a tear,"At the time of its denationalisation in 1984, Pubali Bank's defaulted loans were more than 50 per cent owing to a lack of corporate governance. The bank set out to turn around from its fragile financial health and it has not had to look back since then.Today, Pubali Bank is one of the sound financial organisations in Bangladesh and non-performing loans (NPLs) have fallen to as low as 3 per cent, way lower than the industry average of more than 8 per cent.""But it was not a smooth journey as multidimensional efforts had to be taken to improve the health,"" said Safiul Alam Khan Chowdhury, managing director of Pubali Bank Ltd.He joined the bank as a senior officer in 1983 after completing his post-graduation from the University of Dhaka.After serving it for nearly four decades, he is set to retire tomorrow, joining a small group of banking professionals who spent their entire career in a single organisation and went on to helm the pole position.In fact, Chowdhury was the one who had first-hand knowledge of how the bank was rebuilt from the scratch. In fact, he played an active role in improving the financial health of the lender.""Our main aim was to fortify the corporate governance, helping the bank become vibrant,"" said Chowdhury in an interview with The Daily Star yesterday.Capacity development and the change in the mindset of the workforce have also played a crucial role in the transition of the bank. And all contributed to the reduction of NPLs drastically.Subsequently, it came out of the list of problem banks in 2005 and the Bangladesh Bank withdrew its observer two years later.At present, Pubali Bank is the highest profit maker among conventional private commercials bank in Bangladesh.Its net profit stood at Tk 435 crore last year, up 17.4 per cent a year ago. Operating profit surged to Tk 991 crore in the first nine months of 2022, versus Tk 771 crore generated during the identical period a year ago.""We have achieved all these without compromising corporate governance,"" said Chowdhury.He cited customer satisfaction as the main driver for the bank's stellar performance year after year. Pubali Bank has placed equal importance on mobilising deposits, selecting borrowers cautiously, and facilitating exports, imports and remittance flow in order to diversify earnings.Embracing modern technologies and digital solutions has put the bank on a higher growth trajectory.ICT-based initiatives of the Bangladesh Bank, customers' expectations and demand, and rapid advancement in information and communication technology have significantly influenced the banking industry in recent years.Thus, the lender, which was established in 1959, has taken a leading role when it comes to introducing a number of banking services provided digitally.In order to take banking services to customers, it introduced an app-based banking product named ""PI Banking"" in August 2020. An e-KYC (electronic know your customer) and an instant e-KYC-based account opening system have already been rolled out.""We have invested a lot to ensure security and use big data analytics, data mining and artificial intelligence to reshape our online banking,"" Chowdhury said.According to the veteran banker, technological advancement will be the key driver for growth in the banking sector in the coming years. So, Pubali Bank has decided to rely less on cash and workforce with a view to minimising costs.He also touches upon the ongoing stress in the country's foreign exchange market, driven by US dollar shortages amid higher imports and escalated commodity costs.""The central bank has taken some good initiatives such as the restrictions on importing luxury items, increasing the margin on letters of credit, giving incentives to remitters and exporters, and fixing the exchange rate for exports and remittance.""""The country needs to reduce imports through import substitution by utilising every available resource.""Chowdhury suggested exporters search for niche markets to increase export and create their own brands.""We also need to focus on the Indian market to raise our exports and narrow the trade gap. Congenial environment for doing business has to be created to attract foreign direct investment.""During his long career, he worked as a branch manager, regional manager, division head, chairman of the credit committee of the head office and in many other positions. He was promoted to the post of managing director from additional managing director in April last year.He singled out his four-year stint as a manager of the Motijheel Corporate branch as the most challenging time for his career. At that time, the bank was categorised as a problem bank because of its high volume of NPLs.Management realised that if two branches – the Motijheel corporate branch and the foreign exchange branch -- could eliminate huge losses, the result would be enormous and shake up the bank, paving the way for it to move out of the ignominious category of the problem banks.Chowdhury was given the charge of running the Motijheel branch.""I took up the challenge because I have always believed that there exists opportunity wherever there is a challenge. I gave my 100 per cent and within a short time, the branch became profitable.""""The success generated a huge momentum for the entire bank and sowed the seed for its current growth trajectory,"" Chowdhury said.In recognition of his honesty throughout his career, the board of Pubali Bank honoured him with the Integrity Award for the last fiscal year. The central bank also recognised Pubali Bank as a sustainable lender during his time at the top.Chowdhury's parting advice for the banking industry: ""Human resources have to be developed to equip themselves for the massive technological changes going through the financial industry. Banks will also have to find ways to mitigate risks."" "
