/sports/football/news/fifa-asks-bff-pay-days-due-wages-3147051,FIFA asks BFF to pay Day’s due wages,"The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has clearly failed to learn lessons from its past mishaps as the local game's governing body received an instruction from FIFA to clear the due wages of former national team head coach Jamie Day, who was relieved off his duty in September last year, prior to the beginning of SAFF Championship.Neither the BFF nor Day, currently staying in England, had disclosed the amount FIFA Players' Status Committee asked the BFF to pay to the English coach. However, it has been learned that the amount is 86 thousand US dollars.Replying to a query from The Daily Star, Day said, ""Yes, BFF will have to pay as FIFA have awarded me the payment but there isn't much to say on it just yet.""Previously in 2016, FIFA had before instructed the BFF to clear the due wages of sacked Dutch coach Rene Koster, which amounted to 80 thousand euros, including the interest accrued over the unpaid period. Back then, the BFF was also ordered to pay 8000 Swiss francs to FIFA and Koster as proceedings of the case. Ultimately, the BFF took more than a year to transfer payments to the Dutch coach.Meanwhile, in a video statement, BFF general secretary Abu Nayeem Shohag said today, ""Former coach Jamie Day appealed to FIFA about his unpaid wages and FIFA has asked us to give away the compensation to Jamie. Our legal department is now working on it to appeal the matter to FIFA.""Day further informed that he had been in constant touch with the BFF to recover his unpaid wages, as per his contract. However, after failing to do so, he was forced to lodge the complaint to FIFA early this year.Consequently, FIFA gave the verdict on Tuesday asking the BFF to clear the due wages of Day, whose two-year contract was supposed to expire in August in 2022."
/shout/news/has-the-medias-obsession-shakib-khan-gone-too-far-3147066,Has the media's obsession with Shakib Khan gone too far?,"Some psychologists suggest that gossip is the ""glue that binds social groups together"".While we can justify our unquenchable thirst to absorb and distribute personal, and often clandestine, information about celebrities using psychology, the same cannot be said for media organisations that impede into the personal lives of celebrities to provide coverage.Recently, there has been a surge in coverage of the actor Shakib Khan and his relationship with film actress and news anchor Shobnom Bubly. Many of the articles published cover and extend on pre-existing rumors about their divorce, and speculations of their current relationship since they uploaded a picture of their two-year old son. However, the coverage went just beyond that. From probing into their personal lives, contacting close family members, to solidifying rumors about Shakib's involvement with other female co-stars, the media stopped at nothing to pump out content.This harms our community in a multitude of ways, the first one being the most obvious one: not doing justice to the right to privacy of these celebrities. It is already difficult for celebrities, wherever they may be from, to keep their lives under the wraps from the public. It's easy for us to forget that they are just like the rest of us, and have the same inalienable rights to privacy and non-disclosure as us.In this wild goose-chase of Shakib Khan's history and his past and present involvement with co-stars, the personal lives of female artists like Apu Biswas, Puja Chery, and Shabnom Bubly herself were put in jeopardy.As much as the audience should try to deter from being obsessed with canards and tell-tales, media organisations also have the unique responsibility of protecting the actors involved in the drama, not to mention the children of Shakib Khan as well. This forced limelight that children face due to the lottery of being born to celebrities is absolutely damaging to their childhood. The moral responsibility of sparing them the flashes of the paparazzi rests solely on the shoulders of these newspapers, TV channels and news portals, something that they do not seem to pay heed to.There exists a fine line between providing news reports on currently sought-after topics and being invasive. And in our information hungry delusions we often don't realise that the line we have crossed is miles behind us.I sympathise with those who have the job of providing coverage on celebrities and their lives, but that sympathy is valid only up to the point where they are not stepping on civil liberties or harming the readers in doing so. Just because a market for this content exists does not mean it is justified for publications to go absurd lengths to acquire information that they know the public will devour.As a general rule, I think it is okay to report on celebrities' personal lives as long as the information being published comes from those celebrities themselves and are consensually disclosed by them only, where they are aware of the exposure that they're subjecting themselves to. When it comes to children, media organisations must be proactive in taking responsibility even if their celebrity parents aren't aware of the dangers that come with having a limelight at infancy.Following the scandal around Shakib Khan's marriage, our feeds and front doors got saturated with articles that are basically gossip written in formal language. It's all invasive, not only are they stepping on the civil liberties of these celebrities, but invading the lives of the general public as well. After a point these articles get harder and harder to avoid. Algorithms work their magic by pushing juicy articles to the top and suppressing genuine and informative journalism. The more likes and shares articles about Shakib Khan get, the more incentive media houses have to uncover never-seen-before information, and this deprave cycle continues.Koushin Unber wishes to fast-track winter in Dhaka.

/daily-star-books/news/graphic-novel-the-push-and-pull-friendships-3146991,A graphic novel on the push and pull of friendships,"The last decade has seen the graphic novel take off in mainstream literary circles, moulding the depth of emotive storytelling with gorgeous, picturesque artwork. Most graphic novels, save a few such as Will Eisner's A Contract with God, have rarely been a collection of short stories. It's Not What You Thought It Would Be (Fantagraphics, 2021) is one such graphic novel saturated with a plethora of short stories around themes of friendship—the lost ones, the transitory ones, and the recovering ones—alongside ideas about the formation of the self. How does one navigate expectations, and accept the terms of a relationship between one's desires and needs? The author-illustrator, Lizzy Stewart, who teaches illustration at Goldsmiths College, conjures up a series of short, lively, and uniquely heartwarming stories that make it hard to believe that this is her debut collection. Stewart places her strong female characters and stories in a myriad of different settings which serve as the background to a flow of the conversations taking place. Intensely relatable as the reader flips the pages, the stories occur in places deeply etched into many of our memories—from rooftops to buses to benches in the park to the digital world of emails and texts.Nine incredibly jarring and vibrantly beautiful stories wrapped into one book. The stories take place in line with the ebb and flows of seeking different truths and understanding friendships and relationships with a heartfelt intensity. Each story has a unique setting to it. The first story, ""Heavy Air"", deals with a group of friends making a shelter for an injured fox in a neglected estate that ends up getting wrecked by a torrent of rainfall. ""Blush"" deals with the annals of growing up ""embarrassed to get anything right and equally embarrass[ed] to get anything wrong"", ending with the positive message of self-growth.""Dog Walk"" is an exciting story with two teenage girls frolicking from the park to a nearby roof, hoping to meet someone new and exciting. Interesting stories that harken to a time we have known and relished. ""Walking Home"" is a short story without any dialogue whatsoever; it leaves the sepia-minded artwork to do the talking in the reader's mind. ""Quiet"" is about a voice artist struggling to juggle her own needs versus the demands of her followers. ""Kindness is a noise. I wanted to make people hear kindness"", the artist says in the story. Perhaps the most heartfelt stories in the collection are ""A Quick Catch Up"" and ""The Wedding Guests"", which deal with placements and changing courses of friendship, from deep trust to the mundane to distant ones, portrayed through both in-person conversations and in digital settings. The dialogues are emotive, beguiling, and relatable. The artwork in each of the stories is relatable. Muted with shades of black, white, grey and blue—except the last story, which is filled with colours as the two characters chart their journey from dreamy childhood to the confusing phase of adulthood. The pages change from water colour images of nature and spaces to blue-ink drawn landscapes of various settings and the inhabitants in them. This is a soft, reflective collection of storytelling that touches your nerves gently, proving the tenacity and importance of friendships in our daily lives. In a banal life filled with anxieties, It's Not What You Thought It Would Be proves how, at the end of the day, we both constitute and make our own stories.Israr Hasan is a Senior Research Assistant at BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health.

The foreign ministry said it had no comment to offer.Journalists in Kashmir have long been under the close scrutiny of local and national authorities, who also strictly control access for foreign reporters who want to travel there.The Himalayan region is claimed in full by both India and neighbouring Pakistan, but both countries only control parts of it.Reuters said it had not been provided any reason for blocking Mattoo's travel.""We are disappointed that Sanna Irshad Mattoo, a contributor to Reuters, has not been allowed to travel to the United States to receive her Pulitzer Prize in New York alongside her peers.""""We have not been offered an official explanation as to why she has not been allowed to leave the country, but we believe that journalists should be able to travel freely,"" Reuters said in a statement.Mattoo had said in a tweet in July that immigration officials in New Delhi also had barred her from flying to France, where she was scheduled to attend a book launch and photography exhibition.In Mattoo's tweet on Tuesday she said that despite reaching out to several officials after the July incident, she had not received a response."
/environment/news/dhaka-list-20-most-unsustainable-megacities-3146661,Dhaka in list of 20 most unsustainable megacities,"Dhaka is one of the 20 most unsustainable megacities in the world, as per a new climate report.The report titled, ""Ecological Threat Report (ETR)"", released Wednesday (October 19, 2022) found that South Asia is home to eight of the world's 20 most unsustainable megacities, with half of them in India alone.Produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), featuring exclusive research from the Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll, the Ecological Threat Report tracks the links between climate-change, ecological threats, and violent conflict or forced migration each year.Dhaka, Lahore, Kolkata, Delhi, Karachi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad are eight of the 20 cities facing the highest population growth and worst vulnerability to ecological threats.Bangladesh has seen 254 natural disasters respectively since 1981, according to the report.Many South Asian countries and cities exemplify the challenge of managing growing populations and ecological threats.For example, Dhaka, a city of 22.6 million people, is affected by ecological changes in several ways. It floods regularly, it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, and the city struggles to deal with waste, said the Ecological Threat Report.As per the report, Delhi suffered the highest air pollution of these cities. Air pollution was responsible for economic losses totalling USD 8.1 trillion, or 6.1 per cent of global economic output. While India is the world's third largest polluter, only 38.8% of its population consider climate change to be a serious threat.At least 56% countries and territories (127 out of 228) monitored by the ETR are facing catastrophic ecological threats. Europe is predicted to see high levels of water stress over next 20 years, with increased water stress predicted in Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Portugal and the Netherlands, amongst others.The countries most vulnerable to ecological threat are clustered in the three least peaceful regions: sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East & North Africa (MENA), and South Asia.In 2021, almost 92% of the world's undernourished people lived in low to very low peace countries, said the report. Megacities in low peace countries, like Kinshasa and Nairobi, have the highest population growth rates, low coping capacities, and will struggle to manage ecological threats. The world's 40 least peaceful countries will increase their population by 1.3 billion by 2050, representing 49% of the world's population.Forty-one countries are currently facing severe food insecurity, impacting economic development, public health, and social harmony, with 830 million people at risk, with 89% residing in sub-Saharan-Africa, followed by MENA with 49 million. Food insecurity is connected to water stress, defined as ""when more than 20% of the population do not have access to clean drinking water"".At least 23 out of 27 hotspot countries facing climate catastrophes with extremely low societal resilience are clustered in sub-Saharan Africa, said the report.The report's main overall finding is that the degradation of resources leads to violence and violence leads to the degradation of resources, according to the press release."
/business/news/indias-experiences-sme-development-can-be-used-bangladesh-3147046,'India’s experiences in SME development can be used in Bangladesh',"Bangladesh may use the Indian experience in the development of their small and medium enterprises, analysts said today.They spoke at a discussion between CII and FMC delegation at the office of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI).For developing cooperation, SME Foundation Managing Director Md Mafizur Rahman called for signing an memorandum of understandung between SME foundation and its Indian counterpart.While chairing the meeting, FBCCI President Md Jashim Uddin said, Bangladesh has huge potential in the cluster-based SME.Both the countries can benefit if Bangladesh can harness the Indian experience in flourishing SMEs, he said.Around 80 per cent of the businesses operating in Bangladesh are SMEs. Hence, there is no alternative to SME development to keep the economic pace afloat, the FBCCI president added.He also urged the banks to come forward to disburse more loans to SMEs.He also recommended implementing a ""one district, one product"" campaign and developing clusters based on raw materials available in the districts.Senior Adviser of the Foundation of MSME Cluster (FMC) in India Dr Tamal Sarkar came up with a power point presentation highlighting the development of Indian SMEs.Echoing the event's Bangladeshi speakers, he said both India and Bangladesh share the common nature of SMEs, market demand and culture as well.Therefore, Indian experience may appear to be effective to improve the Bangladeshi SME scenario.Former general manager of Small Industry Development Bank of India (SIDBL) and FMC India's consultant Surendra Srivastava and CII director Amit Kumar also spoke at the meeting.FBCCI Senior Vice President Mostofa Azad Chowdhury Babu, Vice-Presidents Md Amin Helaly, Md Habib Ullah Dawn, Directors and Secretary General Mohammad Mahfuzul Hoque were also present in the meeting."

/life-living/travel/news/top-5-places-visit-sitakunda-3146841,Top 5 places to visit in Sitakunda ,"Well known for its natural beauty, Sitakunda has always been one of the major tourist spots in Bangladesh. Sitakunda is an upazila in Chattogram district hosting the first eco-park of the country. The name of the place itself — Sitakunda is rather intriguing and there are multiple myths behind the origin of the name, but that's another story!
For now, let's discuss the top 5 places you should visit if you are in Sitakunda.  Arguably the most popular place in Sitakunda and had to be number one on the list, Chandranath Hill is well known for its verdant and scenic view. More than a thousand feet in height, the top of the hill takes about an hour and half to reach and once you get there, you will find the temple. With the enchanting view of the sea on one side and the hills on the other, this is a view to savour as one of the most cherished memories. There are two ways to climb the hill and you should choose carefully and prepare before you start trekking.Sitakunda Eco-park is to the south of Sitakunda Bazar and only a few kilometres away. It is the first eco-park of Bangladesh and plays host to a wide number of flora and fauna. Hundreds of different types of flowers and trees are nursed here and as always, the vegetation will rejuvenate you with its soothing green touch. The park also offers home to a number of wild animals such as monkeys, rabbits, chimpanzees, etc. that only adds to the natural elements.Waterfalls such as 'Sohosrodhara' and 'Shuptodhara' are part of the park and if you come during rainy season, you can observe the true beauty of them.Also known as Muradpur Beach, it is one of the most attractive sea beaches in Bangladesh. Only 5 kilometres away from Sitakunda Bazar, the Muradpur Beach is a place that will make you feel things that are just indescribable. With the sea on one side, the Keora Forest on the other and the grass spread like a canvas under your feet, this place offers a view that we see in paintings. The breathing roots of the Keora trees are visible sometimes, adding a flavour to this already picture-perfect landscape.The name of this place is pretty accurate. 'Moha' (great) 'Maya' (enthralling) is the only way to describe the effects of this place. Mohamaya Lake is the second largest artificial lake in Bangladesh with an area of 11 square kilometres. Hills, rubber dam, fountains and crystal-clear water — all this together in a cocktail of absolute bliss and to top it off, you can camp and Kayak here.With the Komoldoho Waterfall as the hero of the trail, there are at least five more different waterfalls on this trail. The Komoldoho Waterfall itself is rather dangerous during rainy season because of its nature and therefore should be visited following the departure of the rainy season. Being one of the most challenging and risky trails in Sitakunda, this place makes up for it with the cathartic feeling it offers once you finish the trail.The Jhorjhori trail should not be missed and it offers a challenging route just like Komoldoho. Kumira Ghat will offer you a soothing view of the sea and a perfect place to witness the sunset in all it's glory. Horinmara trail is as interesting as the name itself. Sagolkanda Waterfall or Kamalak Jharna is getting more and more popular amongst travellers lately.
We suggest that instead of trying to fit everything in a tight schedule, slow down a bit and take your time in this place. Prepare for trekking with proper gears and supplies and try to enjoy the adventure rather than making it a chore to be finished in time.The easiest way to get to Sitakunda is by bus. There are plenty of buses departing from Dhaka to Chittagong every few minutes. Pick any transport service you are comfortable with and board a bus of Dhaka-Chittagong route.

/news/world/uk/news/truss-tries-reassert-authority-rebellion-grows-replace-her-3147016,Truss tries to reassert authority as rebellion grows to replace her,"British Prime Minister Liz Truss sought to reassert authority over her fraught party on Wednesday with Conservative enforcers telling lawmakers they had to support her fracking policy as a vote treated as a test of confidence in the government.Truss is trying to shore up support from within her party after she was forced to scrap her vast tax-cutting plan, leading some Conservative lawmakers to call for her to be replaced as leader just weeks after she took office.She has admitted her radical economic plans had gone ""too far and too fast"" after investors dumped the pound and government bonds.However, with mortgage rates soaring and official figures showing inflation back to a 40-year high, Truss, who was elected by Conservative members on a promise of tax cuts and maintaining public spending, faces a struggle to convince the public and her party she could address the cost of living crisis.Polls indicate Conservatives are some 30 points behind the opposition Labour Party, and her own ratings are calamitous.""What I'm not convinced by ... is that going through another leadership campaign, defenestrating another prime minister, will either convince the British people that we're thinking about them rather than ourselves or convince the markets to stay calm,"" foreign minister James Cleverly told Sky News.But, speculation about the prime minister's future continues to grow, with media reporting that rebellious Conservatives are weighing up who should replace her, not if she should go.""I think her position is becoming increasingly untenable,"" Conservative lawmaker Steve Double told Times radio. ""We've seen a complete reversal of just about everything she stood for in her leadership election campaign. I think many of us are asking exactly what does Liz Truss now believe and stand for?""Truss will face parliament later on Wednesday for her usual weekly question and answer session, and later the main opposition Labour Party will seek to hold a vote on an outright ban on fracking, after the government last month lifted a moratorium in England that had been in place since 2019.Conservative 'whips', responsible for enforcing discipline among members of parliament, sent a message to their lawmakers saying the vote would be treated as a ""confidence motion in the government""."

The number of vehicles registered in 2020-21 fiscal were 4.24 lakh.All vehicles, except for motorcycles, need to take fitness clearance, however, new cars, SUVs and microbuses are not required to have it in the first five years and after that period, they have to get fitness clearance once every two years.Only 5.64 lakh vehicles took fitness clearance in last fiscal year, which is the lowest number since 2014-15 fiscal year, shows BRTA data. The number of vehicles that took fitness clearance certificates in 2020-21, when BRTA offices remained shut for a long time due to Covid-19 pandemic, was 6.75 lakh.A top BRTA official said the amount of advance income tax a vehicle owner has to pay while taking fitness clearance saw around 50 percent rise since July 1, 2021.A vehicle, between 1501cc to 2000cc, has to pay Tk 50,000 which was Tk 30,000 before July, he said.""This is a major reason behind the sharp fall of vehicles taking fitness clearance. The huge amount of money is discouraging people,"" he told this correspondent seeking anonymity.Another BRTA official said there are some vehicles like human haulers and trucks, who has to pay ""ransom"" to get a fitness clearance, so they do not go for it altogether.He said three types of vehicles -- cars, SUVs and microbuses -- had to take fitness clearances annually before January 2020. Now, they have to take clearance once in two years, so the number of vehicles seeking the clearance fell, he said wishing not to be named.In this given situation, the number of vehicles without fitness clearance is growing gradually, shows BRTA data.Around 5.42 lakh registered vehicles, which are eligible for fitness test, did not renew their documents till October 15. The number was 5.08 lakh in January and 4.79 lakh in July 2019.However, the actual number of registered but unfit vehicles may not be that high because many of the 5.42 vehicles may not plying the streets anymore, another BRTA official said."
