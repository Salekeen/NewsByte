/daily-star-books/news/hulus-rosaline-witty-predictable-parody-romeo-and-juliet-3145106,"Hulu’s ‘Rosaline’ is a witty, predictable parody of ‘Romeo and Juliet’ ","Romeo and Juliet (1597) remains to this day one of William Shakespeare's most well-known plays. Director Karen Maine's Rosaline, released on Hulu on October 14, 2022, offers new insight into the beloved tragedy by reimagining it as a romantic comedy. The movie tells the classic love story from the perspective of Juliet's cousin Rosaline (Kaitlyn Dever), who happens to be Romeo's recent ex-girlfriend. Crushed when Romeo (Kyle Allen) meets Juliet (Isabela Merced) and begins to pursue her, Rosaline schemes to foil the famous romance and reclaim her man.In the early years of the Renaissance, Italy was divided into several smaller city-states which often warred with one another. Rome was mostly in ruins—but Padua and Verona came under Venetian control, and cities like Florence and Milan flourished under early financial innovations spearheaded by the Medici clan of bankers and politicians. In the cities, politically powerful wealthy elites became patrons of the arts and a luxury class emerged quickly—but social inequality throughout the majority of the country was profound, and most of Italy belonged to the peasant class. Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, but the play knowingly wags its finger at the warring Capulets and Montagues, wealthy families who can't look past their own insularity and haughty self-importance to be good to one another, or to allow their children the chance at real love. Shakespeare drew on many poems, novels, and myths in the construction of Romeo and Juliet, but it also may very well have been a critique of Renaissance-era social inequality and the trivial concerns of the upwardly mobile elite. In the world of Romeo and Juliet, love is connected through word and action with violence, and Romeo and Juliet's deepest mutual expression of love occurs through their suicides. By connecting love with pain and ultimately with death, Shakespeare suggests that there is an inherent sense of violence in many of the physical and emotional facets of expressing love. In addition to being based on Shakespeare's original tale, Rosaline is also inspired by Rebecca Serle's 2012 novel When You Were Mine, which updates Romeo and Juliet to modern times in Southern California—with the inclusion of Rosaline as a main character. This leads to plenty of intentionally anachronistic choices, such as having Paris (Spencer Stevenson) talk about how Romeo is a ""tasty Montague,"" or including  a cover of Robyn's ""Dancing on My Own"". Incorporating modernity into a known piece of classic literature is not new territory at this point, but Rosaline has some amusing takes on the enduring love story. The movie takes the plot back to the past in Verona, with characters in period clothing. However, it throws out most of the Shakespearean language in hopes of reminding us that Romeo and Juliet at its heart is more accessible and hip than its old-fashioned text. The movie's take on love is far more light-hearted than that of the original tale. Romeo love bombs his way into Rosaline's affections, mostly by speaking in verse. He is a foolish and an impulsive romantic with a poor emotional attention span. Rosaline, comparatively, is an overthinking realist. She is especially entertaining when she playfully calls out the patriarchy of the Renaissance era—a time when she'd be nearly too old to marry and is looked down upon for speaking at the table or aspiring to be a cartographer. ""While you are off writing verse, I am off changing diapers?"" she asks Romeo, establishing her strong character. 
Yet, when Romeo starts pursuing Juliet, Rosaline spends most of her time trying to get him back, which involves sabotaging her sweet and trusting cousin and brushing off the advances of Dario (Sean Teale), a well-mannered soldier and potential suitor. In this light, the movie offers a fresh take, as Rosaline is the kind of underdog character we are curious to see move from the background to centre stage from the start.

While Rosaline starts out wanting to marry for love and be an independent woman in an era where such a thing was unheard of, the chemistry between her and Dario provides each of the two headstrong characters an equal opponent to face off with. The movie is surprisingly non-committal about whether their relationship is going to be forever or just for right now, which feels appropriate for them both. While Rosaline appreciates Romeo and Juliet's romance, she comments on the plot holes, the bizarre timing of events, and of course, the careless plan the star-crossed lovers come up with. That is what makes Rosaline work, though. It takes the premise of the famous play, and holds it up as the lofty idea that it is. Stripped of their romantic grandeur, Romeo and Juliet are kids who barely know each other and enact a convoluted, dangerous plan to be together. The movie is for anyone who loves to make fun of Romeo and Juliet just as much as they also love a love story.
It simultaneously points out the ridiculousness of Romeo and Juliet's situation, while not discrediting love as a concept.

Fascinatingly, the film is the most enjoyable when Rosaline and Juliet team up, like when they pick up local men at a pub. It is, thus, frustrating to watch the two main female characters pitted against each other in a fight for a man who really is not worth the effort. This story element is at odds with the empowering tone the filmmakers were clearly aiming for. 
Nevertheless, the movie successfully demonstrates that although Rosaline initially takes her cousin under her wing as a means of getting her to break up with Romeo, the two develop a bond that leads Rosaline to feel guilty about her deceit. To be honest, I was more invested in the burgeoning friendship between the girls than I was in either of their romantic relationships. Most of the plot is also quite predictable, and the movie's hit-or-miss tone offers a way heavier dose of parody than heart.
Nitpicks and disappointments aside, Rosaline ultimately makes a case for telling the lost stories of characters that never got their due. A witty reimagining, it offers an entertaining riff on Shakespeare for both current teens and those who were that age in the 1990s.

/business/news/oil-steady-recession-fears-counter-positive-chinese-signals-3144991,Oil steady as recession fears counter positive Chinese signals,"Oil prices were steady on Monday as China's continuation of loose monetary policy was offset by fears that high inflation and energy costs could drag the global economy into recession.Brent crude futures rose 17 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $91.80 a barrel by 0915 GMT, recovering from a 6.4 per cent fall last week. US West Texas Intermediate crude was at $85.67 a barrel, up 6 cents, or 0.1 per cent, after a 7.6 per cent decline last week.China's central bank rolled over maturing medium-term policy loans on Monday while keeping the interest rate unchanged for a second month, in a signal that the central bank would continue to maintain loose monetary policy.Beijing would also greatly increase domestic energy supply capacity and step up risk controls in key commodities including coal, oil and gas, and electricity, a senior National Energy Administration official said on Monday.China will further increase reserve capacities for key commodities, another state official told a news conference in Beijing.Oil found support from a combination of factors, including Chinese President Xi Jinping's comments at the Party Congress that reassured accommodative policies for the economy, a positive sign for demand outlook, CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng said.China is expected to release trade and economic data this week, with third-quarter GDP growth possibly set to rebound from the previous quarter, but 2022 threatening to be China's worst performing year in almost half a century.Meanwhile, a strong US dollar and further interest rate increases from the US Federal Reserve limit price gains.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Friday inflation had become ""pernicious"" and difficult to arrest, and warranted continued ""frontloading"" through larger rate increases of three-quarters of a percentage point.Inflation in the United States remains stubborn and growth in European Union countries is due to weaken to half a percent, Gita Gopinath, a senior official at the International Monetary Fund said on Monday.Oil supply is due to remain tight after OPEC and allies like Russia pledged on Oct. 5 to cut output by 2 million barrels per day, as a war of words between OPEC's de facto leader Saudi Arabia and the United States could foreshadow more volatility."

He will appear before Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court on November 21.Wearing a grey hooded top and grey jogging bottoms, Greenwood spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address in court on Monday.A product of the United academy, he has played 129 times for the club, scoring 35 goals and signed a new deal in February 2021, keeping him at Old Trafford until at least 2025.Greenwood made his England debut against Iceland in September 2020, but he and Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden were sent home after a breach of the team's coronavirus guidelines.Nike suspended and later terminated its sponsorship deal with Greenwood, while Electronic Arts confirmed his removal from active squads on its FIFA 22 game after the allegations were made."

/opinion/editorial/news/no-breathing-space-the-poor-3144771,No breathing space for the poor,"Whoever said that poverty is ""violence with tacit consent"" couldn't be truer at the moment. And this violence – in the form of relentless assaults on the wallets of the poor – seems to be getting out of control in Bangladesh. According to a survey of the World Food Programme, 68 percent of the people are struggling to buy food. The sky-high prices of food – which 88 percent of the surveyed identified as a major challenge – are getting harder to deal with: 64 percent said they took loan, and 29 percent of families said they used their savings, to buy food in August.Evidently, things have reached a point where the extremely high living cost has created a dystopian reality for the ordinary people.  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Evidently, things have reached a point where the extremely high living cost has created a dystopian reality for the ordinary people. With food and non-food inflation hovering near double digits, the poor could really use some breathing space. High inflation, according to experts, is affecting people's purchasing capacity, and thereby compromising their health and future. As revealed by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, food inflation reached 9.08 percent in September, after hitting 9.94 percent in August – the highest since FY 2012-13. Meanwhile, non-food inflation reached 9.13 percent in September. How will the poor survive in such a situation?They are being forced to spend less and less on food, as they can't cut spending on rent, utilities, healthcare and transportation, the costs of which have also jumped. While talking to this newspaper, some people described how they are struggling to pay for even the most basic food items. Rice, for example, is being sold at nearly record high prices. Prices of wheat, the second most consumed cereal in Bangladesh, reached ""new record levels in September, over 70 percent above their year-earlier levels"", according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The prices of most vegetables also remain generally high, while eggs, once considered a low-cost source of protein for the poor, are now out of reach for many.The government is apparently leaving no stone unturned to control the situation. For example, to increase the supply of rice and contain its prices, it has reduced import tariff and gave permission to 320 private firms to import 13.4 lakh tonnes of rice. The food directorate also signed contracts with India, Vietnam, Myanmar and Thailand to import 530,000 tonnes of rice under government-to-government arrangement. But continued inflation, unfriendly weather affecting domestic rice production, and the Russia-Ukraine war are proving to be too potent a combination to be contained with such measures. These are taking away for food gains made by Bangladesh.Evidently, things have reached a point where the extremely high living cost has created a dystopian reality for the ordinary people. While increasing food supply through ramped-up production and import is a priority, it is equally important to bring food prices within reach through greater market interventions. Also, as experts have suggested, it is important that the government creates a national relief fund, instead of separate food programmes and project-based initiatives, to provide long-term food assistance to low-income groups. True, some impediments like the Russia-Ukraine war and erratic weather will remain indefinitely. But their consequences can be minimised through implementing proper policies."

An anti-aircraft rocket could be seen streaking into the morning sky, followed by an explosion and orange flames, as residents raced for shelter.A pregnant woman was among three people killed in the attack on the residential building, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Ukraine's Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi said there had been deaths in other cities but did not give a full toll.Black smoke poured out of the windows of the Kyiv apartment building and emergency service workers toiled to douse flames.""I have never been so afraid... It is murder, it is simply murder, there are no other words for it,"" said Vitalii Dushevskiy, 29, a food delivery courier who rents an apartment in the blasted building.His flatmate, who gave his name only as Nazar, said they had tried to leave their flat only to find the staircase ""all gone"".Nearby, Elena Mazur, 52, was searching for her mother, who had managed to call her to say she was buried under rubble.""She is not picking up the phone,"" Mazur said, hoping she had been rescued and taken to hospital.Ukraine said the attacks were carried out by Iran-made 'suicide drones', which fly to their target and detonate. Russia's defence ministry said it had carried out a ""massive"" attack on military targets and energy infrastructure across Ukraine using high-precision weapons.""All night and all morning the enemy terrorizes the civilian population. Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app.""The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us. The occupiers will get only fair punishment and condemnation of future generations. And we will get victory.""Reuters saw pieces of a drone used in the attack that bore the words: ""For Belgorod"" - an apparent reference to Ukrainian shelling of a Russian region bordering Ukraine.KAMIKAZE DRONESThe strikes came exactly one week after Russia unleashed its heaviest aerial bombardment of Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities since the start of the war - also during morning rush hour.""This is already a tradition: to wake Ukrainians with missiles on Mondays,"" said Alla Voloshko, a 47-year-old lawyer who took shelter in the basement of her apartment block.Ukraine's military said it had destroyed 37 Russian drones since Sunday evening, or around 85% of those used in attacks.A drone attack hit the Everi marine terminal in the southern city of Mykolaiv late on Sunday, officials said, damaging sunflower storage tanks and setting aflame leaking oil.""This is an entirely civilian facility. There is no military,"" said Andriy, 47, a senior manager who declined to give his last name. He said the attacks were part of a Russian effort to ""destroy the economy and to destroy food security"".The new United Nations human rights chief, Volker Turk of Austria, said drone attacks on civilians had to stop.Russia denies targeting civilians in its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, now in its eighth month.Iran repeated on Monday its denial that it is supplying the drones to Russia. The Kremlin has not commented.Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter: ""Iran is responsible for the murders of Ukrainians. Country that oppresses its own people is now giving ru-monsters (Russians) weapons for mass murders in the heart of Europe.""Some European Union foreign ministers, in Luxembourg for talks, called for new sanctions against Iran if Tehran's involvement in Russia's war on Ukraine is proven.SHELLINGRussia has accused Ukraine of hitting targets in Belgorod region near the border. Pro-Russian news sources on Telegram reported that Ukraine had struck Belgorod's airport overnight. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv, which typically does not comment on incidents in Russia.Elsewhere on Monday, renewed Russian shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe's largest, caused it to be disconnected again from Ukraine's power grid, Ukrainian state energy firm Energoatom said.The plant, which has often been shelled during the war, is occupied by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff.""Such nuclear blackmail of a terrorist country should not go unanswered by the world community! Ukraine needs protection of the sky above its energy facilities!"" Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook.Russia has long blamed Kyiv for shelling at the plant.In southern central Ukraine, a large fire broke out at an energy facility in the Dnipropetrovsk region after an overnight missile hit, a local official said.British military intelligence said on Monday Russia was facing more acute logistical problems in southern Ukraine after a blast on Oct. 8 caused damage to Russia's road-and-rail bridge to Crimea, the peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014.Russia's defence ministry said on Monday its forces had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to breach their defences in the southern Kherson region.Ukrainian forces, helped by Western arms, have clawed back territory in Kherson region - strategically vital as it links Crimea to the rest of Ukraine - and in parts of the northeast in a major counter-offensive over the past two months.EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday to set up a mission to train some 15,000 Ukrainian troops from next month and to provide an extra 500 million euros worth of funding for arms deliveries to Kyiv."

A new set of players are on the running to win the prestigious award this time.The Ballon D'Or is selected by a jury made of journalists from various nations who are instructed by France Football to judge players based on their individual performance, team performance and fair play.Mohamed Salah's PFA Player of the Year winning performance, golden boot winning campaign from likes of Mbappe and Lewandowski, Kevin De Bruyne's all-round performance that brought Manchester City the league title were all in the discussion about who should win the award.However, the one who seems to be on the verge of winning the award this time is the Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema. Various news portals are already claiming that he has been decided as the winner.The award is intended to be given to the best performer in a particular season. This is not decided by only looking at the statistics of a player. Performance in big games, impact in team's success also matter along with individual player's statistics.In this case, what gives Benzema the edge over others is that not only was he the top scorer in both La Liga (27 goals) and UEFA Champions League (15 goals), his contribution led to his team winning both the competition, making his performance the most impactful.There are often disagreements on who should be the winner between fans and pundits. But considering the trophies won, impact made for the team's success and the individual statistics, Karim Benzema should be winning the coveted Ballon D'Or this year unless something unexpected takes place.Tamjidul Hoque likes to talk about football and checks his emails from time to time, you can contact him at tamjidulh@gmail.comREFERENCES1. si.com (march 11,2022).

/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/russia-launches-major-attack-ukrainian-infrastructure-3-killed-3145081,"Russia launches major attack on Ukrainian infrastructure, 3 killed","Waves of explosive-laden suicide drones struck Ukraine's capital Monday, setting buildings ablaze and sending people scurrying for shelter or attempting to shoot down the kamikazes — a week after Russia unleashed its most widespread strikes against the country in months.Air attacks in central Kyiv had become a rarity in recent months, and the concentrated use of drones, their blasts echoing across the city, sowed terror and frayed nerves. One of the drones slammed into a residential building, killing three people, said the deputy head of the president's office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Energy facilities were also among the targets.Drones used in the attack appeared to include Iranian-made Shaheds. Previous Russian airstrikes on Kyiv were mostly with missiles. Intense, sustained bursts of gunfire rang out Monday as the drones hummed overhead, apparently soldiers trying to shoot them down. Others headed for shelter — though city life quickly resumed in a country that has become grimly accustomed to attacks.In what many fear could become more common occurrences in urban centers nearly eight months into the war, the barrage came in successive waves of 28 drones, Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Five of them plunged into Kyiv itself, said Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.In the Kyiv region, 13 or more were shot down, all of them as they flew in from the south, said a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yurii Ihnat.One strike appeared to target the city's heating network, hitting an operations center. Another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other. In addition to the three people killed there, Tymoshenko said 19 were rescued from the rubble, four of them wounded. Rescue workers searching for victims scrambled over the debris from which gray smoke billowed.An Associated Press photographer who was out shooting morning scenes of Kyiv caught one of the drones on camera, its triangle-shaped wing and pointed warhead clearly visible against the blue sky.""The whole night, and the whole morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post. ""Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine.""""The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us,"" he wrote.The Iranian-made Shaheds, which Russia has rebranded as Geran-2 drones, pack an explosive charge and can linger over targets before nosediving into them. They can be fired one after the other.Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, confirmed in a social media post that Shahed drones were among those used in the strike. Iran has previously denied providing Russia with weapons, although its Revolutionary Guard chief has boasted about providing arms to the world's top powers, without elaborating.The drones have also been repeatedly used by Russia elsewhere in Ukraine in recent weeks to target urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations. They are comparatively cheap, costing in the region of US$20,000.Their use in swarms presents a challenge to Ukrainian air defenses, said Ihnat, the Air Force spokesman. Western nations have promised to bolster Ukrainian air defenses with systems that can shoot down drones but much of that weaponry has yet to arrive and, in some cases, may be months away.""The challenges are serious because the air defense forces and means are the same as they were at the beginning of the war,"" Ihnat said. Some air defense weaponry supplied by Western nations can only be used during daylight hours when targets are visible, he added.After months during which strikes in central Kyiv were rare, early morning strikes last week put Kyiv as well as the rest of the country back on edge.Russian President Vladimir Putin said those strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Putin blames Ukraine for masterminding the blast, which suspended traffic over the bridge and curtailed Moscow's ability to supply Russian troops in the occupied regions of southern Ukraine.The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Zelenskyy said in his Sunday evening address that there was heavy fighting around the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region.The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the industrial east known as the Donbas, and were two of four regions annexed by Russia in September in defiance of international law.On Sunday, the Russian-backed regime in the Donetsk region said Ukraine had shelled its central administrative building in a direct hit. No casualties were reported."
