The first winner was selected in 1969.Last year, half of the award went to David Card for his research on how the minimum wage, immigration and education affect the labor market.

Bertozzi and K. Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal for developing a way of ""snapping molecules together"" that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs that can target diseases such as cancer more precisely.French author Annie Ernaux won this year's Nobel Prize in literature Thursday.

/shout/news/depression-and-drainage-energy-causal-relationship-hell-3139206,Depression and drainage of energy: a causal relationship from hell,"As someone who feels her best when she's at her most productive, I have always been on the losing side in the uphill battle with my regular bouts of sadness. Every time I feel upset, my energy levels drop, which in turn hampers my productivity, and that makes me even more upset. You can see how that spirals into a vicious cycle of seemingly never-ending depression and fatigue.Until a few weeks ago, my defence mechanism, if we can call it that, was to simply wait my episodes of depression out. Before that, when I had first started experiencing depression during the early years of my adolescence, I would try to force myself to do some work – hobbies, household chores, schoolwork, anything. However, after a few times of achieving barely any progress in the short lists of tasks I would assign myself, I realised my approach to productivity was not going to work. Watching and following the advice of countless TED Talks about productivity, procrastination, and depression didn't work either.Ultimately, I decided to simply accept my ""nature"" of going into a mild hibernation every time the blues came around, but recently, a spark of inspiration reignited itself. This time, I decided to start by understanding exactly why sadness robs me and many of my friends of our energy, and knowing that has made some great changes in my life.To put it simply, depression negatively affects neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. These chemicals are responsible for regulating certain markers of happiness like healthy appetite, motivation and of course, energy levels.Similarly, depression makes us lose out on sound sleep. Either by reducing the hours of sleep we get overall or the depth of our sleep, depression compromises the quality of our sleep, which leaves us feeling less energetic and fresh. This discovery shocked me as I thought I was sleeping perfectly fine until I started noting how I feel after a night's rest when I'm not dealing with my blues. My sleep is indeed lighter when I feel upset.Brain fog is another symptom of depression and this can make taking even the simplest decisions incomprehensibly hard, draining people before they even get to actually work.Learning all this helped me navigate my fatigue better. I personally turn to designated hours of self-care every day now. Long showers, journaling, going out in the sun more often – these activities give my mood a boost and that's what I was looking for all along, ways to uplift myself and uproot the main cause of my fatigue, the depression. Instead of treating my fatigue like a cause of my depression, I view it as a symptom and focus more on my depression instead. Taking measures to feel better is what eventually gives me the energy I need to do things I enjoy and need to do.However, the journey might not necessarily look the same for everyone. Unlike me, some people struggle with depression due to specific instances in their lives and for them, the efforts needed to make themselves feel good can be different – change in sleep routine, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), medicine, exercise, therapy and so on. Whatever the case, the most feasible solution is to dig at the roots of the problem and the best way to do it is to consult a professional for guidance, but the main goal should not be solely greater productivity. It can be a motivator, yes, but the primary concern should always be the quality of your life and well-being because you are worth it.References:

/entertainment/tv-film/news/five-bollywood-films-deal-mental-health-3139201,Mental health represented in Bollywood: Five stellar movies,"Mental health has always been heavily stigmatised within the Indian subcontinent. This is particularly the case in the mainstream media, where we often see misguided portrayals of the issue, often being showcased as 'madness' rather than a health issue.In the past, mental health has often been reduced to a sub-plot, solely for entertainment purposes. This exacerbation of pre-existing stigmas, often through 'crazy' characters—usually destined to be sent off to an asylum—is a common theme in Bollywood.With the times changing, coupled with more awareness, Bollywood filmmakers began making a serious effort to address mental health with more sympathy and knowledge. This shift was important, because films have the power to influence the general opinions of the public.Representations of mental health issues in Indian films date back to 2005, with Aparna Sen's classic ""15 Park Avenue"". This film revolves around the life of Meethi, a schizophrenic, played by Konkona Sen Sharma. It brilliantly explores the impact of the disease on her life, her family, and her relationships, and it is one of the very first films attempting to destigmatise this sensitive issue.With each layer of the story fleshing out a new perspective about the protagonist, ""15 Park Avenue"" provides specificity and a much-needed representation of someone living with schizophrenia. Sen personally regarded this to be her most 'honest' film, given that she had first-hand experiences of dealing with similar trauma. In the same year, Sanjay Leela Bhansali presented his viewers with ""Black"", a film where Debraj, Amitabh Bachchan's character, struggles with Alzheimer's disease. This film was far from the usual, aesthetically-pleasing drama we expect from the director.Bhansali drew inspiration from Hellen Keller's autobiography for the film, to put forward a compelling story about a deaf and blind girl, and her elderly tutor. While it did not deal with the details of Debraj's conditions, it provided a good sneak peek into the early symptoms of disorientation and confusion, allowing people to relate and empathise with individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease.    In 2007, Aamir Khan produced and acted in ""Taare Zameen Par"", a film that greatly helped normalise children within the autism spectrum in the Indian subcontinent. Even after 15 years of its release, it is widely appreciated and referred to for shedding light on how the education system treats children living with these conditions.""Taare Zameen Par"" was also one of the first mainstream films that incorporated mental health within the main plot, through Ishaan and his struggles with dyslexia. The movie was not only a blockbuster, but also very successful in initiating conversations about learning disorders in otherwise conservative households. It presented dyslexia from the perspective of the eight-year-old protagonist, as a real problem faced by millions of children across the world.Another remarkable film starring Alia Bhatt, ""Dear Zindagi"", greatly normalised the idea of seeking professional help through therapy, eradicating the notion that these conditions are all made up and exaggerated.Kaira, the protagonist, is seen struggling with depression and abandonment issues. The film reveals the causes behind her mental health struggles, helps her achieve clarity on them, and ends on a rather happy note. It follows her journey towards self-development, healing and love.""Dear Zindagi"" also blurred the lines between the psychiatrist and the patient, showing how their individual approaches do not need to be strict and intimidating. While this film intended to connect more with young adults, it had a little something for everyone.  Finally, another Bollywood film that explored the importance of mental health and left a lasting impression, is Nitesh Tiwari's ""Chhichhore""—which deals with anxiety. While the film features the everyday adventures of a group of university friends, it does an amazing job of reflecting the societal pressures of expectations, especially within this subcontinent.This film is a cult favourite, and has been greatly appreciated for its attempt to tackle suicide prevention through mainstream media.Films such as these have not only shed light on mental health conditions, but have also been instrumental in initiating difficult conversations, by presenting relatable characters and circumstances."
