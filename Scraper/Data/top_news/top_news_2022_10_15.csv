/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/how-build-capsule-wardrobe-3143396,How to build a capsule wardrobe,"If you have been following the fashion influencer or the lifestyle influencer scene on the Internet in the past few years, you must have come across the term ""capsule wardrobe"". Below, we describe everything there is to know about capsule wardrobes for both men and women, including the steps to developing a capsule wardrobe and items to purchase. A capsule wardrobe is simply a collection of clothing composed of thoughtfully curated, easily interchangeable items designed to maximise the number of outfits that you can create. These pieces will create a strong foundation for your entire collection. These are minimal, comfortable, classic, and timeless pieces that will go with everything else you own and can be worn again and again. The items will be carefully and intentionally selected to provide purpose to your lifestyle. I'm sure you have experienced the ""I have nothing to wear despite my closet overflowing"" phenomenon at least once in your life. Often, we end up purchasing random pieces that just collect dust in our closets as it becomes difficult to integrate those into our everyday lives. Having a capsule wardrobe saves us from this decision fatigue. Decision fatigue is the weary feeling you get after being faced with too many decisions, affecting your decision-making choices, and the quality of the process. Having a curated wardrobe makes it easier to pick outfits for any occasion, saving time shopping, deciding what to wear, and reducing stress. It also allows you to discover and develop your personal style. A capsule wardrobe is also very sustainable and wallet-friendly. As you purchase high-quality items, that serve a purpose to your style and life, you end up wearing and re-wearing every piece, with nothing going to waste. Buying fewer items allows you to save up money for the more important things in life. It also reduces your carbon footprint. Before you start building a capsule wardrobe, keep in mind that it is a fairly slow process and takes about 2-3 years to build and perfect. You are not expected to build the wardrobe overnight. Do not be too stressed about it, it is an exercise to help you be more conscious, not a punishment. You should have a capsule wardrobe for each of the seasons. If you reside in Dhaka, having two capsule wardrobes – one for summer and one for winter will work just fine. Assess everything in your wardrobe. Try them on, see if they fit you, if you like them and if they flatter you. Ask yourself when is the last time you wore this item. The goal is to analyse and find out what you gravitate towards and what you never touch. Set aside clothes that do not fit you anymore, that do not work for you anymore, and that you do not need. Get rid of clothes that are stained, damaged, and worn out beyond repair. Divide your finding into the three following parts: if a piece works for you but not for this season – place it in storage. If the piece does not work for you – sell or give it away. Pieces that work for you but you have not worn them out as much – give them a 3-month trial period. If you own multiple items which are similar in nature, keep one and remove the others. Another way to find out what you wear regularly, turn all your coat hangers to face the same way, then every time you wear something, turn it around. By the end of the month, you will have a good sense of the wardrobe heroes that you cannot live without as these are the pieces you should be basing your capsule around. Make sure to donate your decluttered or sell them second-hand, to ensure that the clothes reach those who need them, getting a second life.  It is time to chalk out a plan for your wardrobe. First, decide on the number of clothing you would like to own. While people decide on various numbers ranging from 26-37, you do not have to stick to such numbers. Just make sure you do not go overboard with your shopping for the capsule. Create an ideal shopping list, and compare it with your closet to find gaps. Your wish list should be consistent with your personal taste, style, how you spend most of your time and lifestyle. When you go to purchase something, make a mental note of what you are going to wear it with. This will help you build outfits instead of having pretty individual pieces. Remember, you are dressing for your actual life, not for some moments. Think about your goals, values, and intention behind the pieces. Always invest in quality pieces that will last years and fix your budget accordingly. This is by no means an exhaustive list and you can modify it depending on your needs. Your capsule is also not the ""end all, be all"". You can elevate it over the years and tap into the trends. Avoid buying into fads that will be out of fashion in a short time. Invest in trends that will last a few seasons. In order to take it slow, just plan in detail for the upcoming season, then edit and transition between each season. Choose pieces that are both functional and versatile. consider how easily it can be mixed and matched with other pieces, colours, and patterns, and whether you can wear it to different events or in different seasons.A neutral colour palette that includes black, white, grey, navy, beige, and cream is very versatile, allowing you to wear more colours with intention and weave different clothing genres together to create seamless looks. One way of incorporating colours is to select 2-3 accent colours per season to include in your seasonal capsule. Solid colours, which are not too muted or bright can be very versatile. Play around with textures, fabrics, and sizes too. Experimenting with different cuts, silhouettes, and sleeve styles adds a unique flair to your outfits. There is room to add prints to your wardrobe. Choose from classic prints like stripes, navy stripes, houndstooth, polka dots, and some iterations of plaids and checks. Just because Miranda Priestly from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was not impressed with florals for spring, does not mean you cannot have florals for spring and summer. Floral prints, whether big or small are always amazing for the summer and spring in blouses, dresses, and Kurtis. Do not view a capsule wardrobe as something restrictive. It is in fact quite the opposite. While the capsule wardrobe is meant to serve you for years to come, you can definitely edit and elevate it as you go. Just do not go down the rabbit hole of mindless shopping when adding things to your closet. Happy shopping! "
/business/news/oil-prices-fall-more-3-cent-recession-worries-3143361,Oil prices fall more than 3 per cent on recession worries,"Oil prices plummeted more than 3 per cent on Friday as global recession fears and weak oil demand, especially in China, outweighed support from a large cut to the OPEC+ supply target.Brent crude futures dropped $2.94, or 3.1 per cent, to settle at $91.63 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $3.50, or 3.9 per cent, to $85.61.The Brent and WTI contracts both oscillated between positive and negative territory for much of Friday but fell for the week by 6.4 per cent and 7.6 per cent, respectively.US core inflation recorded its biggest annual increase in 40 years, reinforcing views that interest rates would stay higher for longer with the risk of a global recession. The next US interest rate decision is due on Nov. 1-2.US consumer sentiment continued to improve steadily in October, but households' inflation expectations deteriorated a bit, a survey showed.The improvement in consumer sentiment ""is being viewed as a negative because it means the Fed needs to break the spirit of the consumers and slow the economy down more, and that's caused an increase in the dollar and downward pressure on the oil market,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.The US dollar index rose around 0.8 per cent. A stronger dollar reduces demand for oil by making the fuel more expensive for buyers using other currencies.In US supply, energy firms this week added eight oil rigs to bring the total to 610, their highest since March 2020, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said. read moreChina, the world's largest crude oil importer, has been fighting COVID-19 flare-ups after a week-long holiday. The country's infection tally is small by global standards, but it adheres to a zero-COVID policy that is weighing heavily on economic activity and thus oil demand.The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Thursday cut its oil demand forecast for this and next year, warning of a potential global recession.The market is still digesting a decision last week from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together known as OPEC+, when they announced a 2 million barrel per day (bpd) cut to oil production targets.Underproduction among the group means this will probably translate to a 1 million bpd cut, the IEA estimates.Saudi Arabia and the United States have clashed over the decision.Meanwhile, money managers raised their net long US crude futures and options positions by 20,215 contracts to 194,780 in the week to Oct. 11, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said."

/news/bangladesh/news/park-coffee-cart-or-biryani-shop-3143006,"Park, coffee cart or biryani shop?","In Old Dhaka's Bangshal stands a park in the shape of a triangle. It used to provide citizens with an avenue to go on morning and evening walks, or spend their leisure surrounded by greenery.This park, which dates back to the pre-independence era, had a library, 10 to 12 benches to sit on, and a small field, where children used to play.But due to sheer apathy of the authorities concerned, this park soon lost its glamour.The size of the park gradually shrank, as land grabbing went on unabated, while the remaining parts were too dilapidated to visit.To salvage whatever was left of the park, the first elected mayor of Dhaka, Mohammad Hanif renovated it, and installed a water fountain and two dove sculptures, as a symbol of peace.To carry on his father's legacy, former Dhaka south mayor Sayeed Khokon renovated the park and inaugurated it for the public in 2020.New walkways,  fresh grass, extended seating arrangements and lights were installed at the place under this project, and the water fountain was made functional.Soon after, the park was leased out to Bangshal Thana Bangabandhu Parishad president Haji Ahsan Ullah. Under the lease agreement,  Ahsan and company were supposed to run a coffee shop, on condition of selling coffee in a wheeled cart alongside taking care of the park.Building any permanent structure to sell anything other than coffee wasn't permitted under this arrangement.But in a recent visit to the Bangshal Park, this correspondent saw that a permanent steel structure has been built there, occupying at least one-third of the place. There are lines of chairs and tables centring it, but rather than coffee, what's being served is biryani.Even the water fountain has been shut down to facilitate the biryani shop. There are a few washing basins, a deep freezer, and rows of plastic chairs and tables inside Haji Ebadullah Biryani House, owned by one Liton Baburchi.Biryani is also served at benches on all three sides of the park.Contacted, Liton Baburchi said he has rented the place from Ahsan Ullah.Locals said they cannot walk or sit in peace at the park anymore, as the place is always abuzz with the biryani shop's customers. Besides, the size of the already small park has reduced significantly because of the makeshift-restaurant, they added.Abdul Hai, a resident of Mokimbazar, Bangshal, said this park used to be bigger.""There was a library here. People came here to read books, walk and play. But the park gradually died.""""When the park was renovated in 2020, or whatever was left of it, the locals thought they would finally get a place to pass peaceful leisure. But the biryani shop has threatened the park's serenity,"" he added.The park's lessee, Haji Ahsan Ullah, said they run the shop ""legally"".He said, ""We run a biryani shop next to the coffee shop. The DSCC officers come for regular inspections. There are no issues.""Local (Ward-35) Councillor Abu Saeed said, ""The park was made for walking, but now it's a business place. People cannot sit and walk. I've made a verbal complaint about this to the city corporation. I'll send a written complaint soon.""DSCC Chief Property Officer Russell Sabrin said there's no scope to run a biryani place after taking permission for a coffee cart.""We will cancel our agreement if the conditions of the lease are being violated,"" he added."
/news/bangladesh/agriculture/news/farmers-kick-start-freshwater-machine-3142976,Farmers kick-start a freshwater machine,"Water is everywhere in and around Bangladesh, yet the lack of freshwater is one of its most pressing concerns.On the surface of this largest river delta on the planet, the abundance of water is facing serious threats of pollution, river encroachment, flooding, and diversion or obstruction of common river waters by India and China. And beneath the surface, there develops a big hollow due to the overdraw of groundwater for irrigation and industrialisation.The scarcity of surface water, especially in the dry season, is gradually pushing Bangladesh to depend heavily on groundwater for supply to households, farms, and industries. While the water outlook for one of the most fertile soils in the world is getting grimmer, a highly-acclaimed research holds out a big hope for Bangladesh, dispelling the commonly-shared fear of the groundwater reserve getting drier every year, and a Jakarta-like land subsidence resulting from it.""It is a ground-breaking research for all sorts of reasons,"" exclaimed the lead researcher Mohammad Shamsudduha over the phone from London Thursday.Published a month ago in the renowned journal Science, six scientists -- five of whom are Bangladeshis -- wrote in their research paper about a great water reservoir below Bangladesh that hardly runs dry. The more water is pumped out of the ""Bengal Water Machine"", as the researchers called it, the more water is pumped into it from the vertical and horizontal flow of freshwater from the surface and nearby lateral water sources.The machine is being considered by geoscientists as nature's very special gift to the people in the Bengal basin, a vast sediment-filled region upon which lies Bangladesh and a part of West Bengal.""This is a huge discovery for Bangladesh. One-third of Bangladesh is getting the benefit of nature's gift,"" Shamsudduha, a professor at the University College London, told The Daily Star. ""It can revolutionise our farming further, as irrigation strategy could now be set scientifically.""The vast underground reservoir for freshwater was crafted slowly over thousands of years by the Ganges and the Brahmaputra that brought in tons of silt and sediment every year from as far away as the Himalayas to form the delta's spongy soil.The Bengal Water Machine was created but not quite started until the 1980s, when Bangladesh stepped up on its rice production in the dry season. Unknowingly, millions of farmers actually kick-started the natural water system by pumping out groundwater for irrigation.Equipped with pumps and agricultural improvements, drought-hit farmers in the north and north-west have gone for extensive irrigation that enabled Bangladesh to produce enough food each year to be nearly self-sufficient by tripling the country's rice production.The geological formation of this Bengal basin responded strangely to the overdraw of the groundwater, with greater depletion triggering faster recharge.""If there was no pumping, then there would have been no water machine functioning,"" said co-researcher Professor Kazi Matin Uddin Ahmed, who is a hydrogeologist at the University of Dhaka. ""When farmers extract more groundwater, the water level falls and it creates room for additional recharge.""Boosting yields aside, the natural water system is believed to have been helping lessen flooding during monsoon seasons. ""If there is no recharge, all the water would be on the surface. Then, we would have a bigger flood,"" said Matin.The entire ecosystem works like a well-oiled machine: farmers pump water out and the porous soil quickly captures the rain-running-flood water before sending it down to the water machine with filtration through layers of soil on the way. Freshwater is stored in reservoirs at different depths, with the majority amount easily accessible by farmers at 100 feet below.About 1,500-2,000 litres of groundwater are required for the production of only one kg of rice in the dry season. And the amount of groundwater that is being pumped in three months for irrigating Boro paddy is mind-blowing.According to a World Bank study in 2021, about 32 cubic kilometres of groundwater is being extracted by the farmers every year, with which a three-story ""water building"" could be built over Bangladesh.Much to the relief, the researchers have found that the Bengal Water Machine kicks in to dispel most of the overdraw concern. Freshwater amounting to 75-90 cubic kilometres were captured and pumped back into the water machine from 1988-2018. Still, there's a huge shortfall.The withdrawal-recharge ratio is not that encouraging and consistent among all regions of Bangladesh. The rice-producing north is precariously-placed. On the other hand, the west generally experiences less rainfall than the east and it reflects on the outcome. Groundwater depletion is taking place in the west but not in the east, finds research.""Apart from the rice-producing north, the Bengal Water Machine is also not working well in the greater Dhaka region, big cities, and industrial areas,"" said co-researcher Prof Anwar Zahid, also a director at the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB).""We must use the groundwater very judiciously and cautiously, looking at the data. Indiscriminate use will only make a disaster imminent,"" warns Anwar, theleading groundwater expert and a key resource person behind the research that spanned over 10 years.The reason why the research is being so hailed across the globe is because of its foundation, a trove of data painstakingly put together over 30 years by the BWDB.Over a thousand observers of the BWDB wells have been monitoring and recording the underground water levels for 60 years by now. And, the researchers used millions of groundwater measurements from 465 shallow monitoring wells (mostly at 25-70 meters depth, from where pumping for irrigation is done).""Groundwater deeper than that level should not be used for irrigation as recharge by rainfall to that level [over 250-300 meters] takes hundreds to thousands of years,"" Anwar said.The other researchers are Richard G Taylor from University College London, Md Izazul Haq and Sara Nowreen."

/middle-east/news/22-killed-turkey-mine-blast-3143171,Death toll from Turkey mine blast now 41,"Rescuers on Saturday found the body of the last missing miner at a coal mine in northern Turkey, bringing the death toll to 41 from a methane blast the previous day.The blast ripped through the mine near the small coal mining town of Amasra on Turkey's Black Sea coast shortly before sunset on Friday.Shortly after his arrival at the site on Saturday afternoon, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that the last missing person had been found dead.""Our priority was to find the miners in the gallery. We finally reached the last one. He also died, bringing the number of deaths to 41,"" he said, ending rescue operations more than 20 hours after the deadly explosion.Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu earlier said 58 miners had survived the blast, ""either by themselves or thanks to rescuers"".He said 28 people had been injured as a result of the blast.Television images late on Friday showed anxious crowds -- some with tears in their eyes -- congregating around a damaged white building near the entrance to the pit in search of news of their friends and loved ones.Erdogan earlier vowed on Twitter that the incident will be thoroughly investigated.Most initial information about those trapped inside was coming from workers who had managed to climb out relatively unharmed.But Amasra mayor Recai Cakir said many of those who survived had suffered ""serious injuries"".Turkey's Maden Is mining workers' union attributed the blast to a build-up of methane gas.But other officials said it was premature to draw definitive conclusions over the cause of the accident.Rescuers sent in reinforcements from surrounding villages to help in the search and rescue.Television footage showed paramedics giving oxygen to the miners who had climbed out, then rushing them to the nearest hospitals.The local governor said a team of more than 70 rescuers had managed to reach a point in the pit some 250 metres below.Turkey's AFAD disaster management service said the initial spark that caused the blast appeared to have come from a malfunctioning transformer.It later withdrew that report and said methane gas had ignited for ""unknown reasons"".The local public prosecutor's office said it was treating the incident as an accident and launching a formal investigation.Turkey suffered its deadliest coal mining disaster in 2014 when 301 workers died in a blast in the western town of Soma."

/opinion/views/open-dialogue/news/what-bangladesh-needs-consider-devaluing-the-taka-further-3143341,What Bangladesh needs to consider before devaluing the taka further,"One of the hottest global news items right now is the effect of the dollar's strength on local currencies and on everyday life. Bangladesh loosened its grip on its currency and allowed the taka to weaken to a record low to preserve dwindling dollars. Like many other countries in the developing world, Bangladesh is dependent on imports, and the high cost of the US dollar is creating a drain on dollar reserves and pushing up the price of essential goods. There is hardly a single item in the country that has not been affected.The US dollar, one of four reserve currencies in the global financial system, is now at its highest in 20 years. The strong dollar and high interest rates in the US, UK, and other countries are ""wreaking havoc"" around the world, exporting inflation, forcing developing countries to raise their own interest rates, and leading to capital outflows. Bangladesh, like others, may soon face difficulties in the sphere of debt repayment.Although Bangladesh Bank (BB) puts the official dollar rate at Tk 95, it reached its highest peak in history in the kerb or open market when it hit Tk 119.9 on August 10, and the dollar rate difference between the Bangladeshi interbank channel and kerb market became Tk 25. The trade deficit widened to USD 27.2 billion in the July 2021-May 2022 period as imports surged to nearly USD 59 billion, while exports rose at a slower pace to USD 31.5 billion.The government and monetary authorities now face a dilemma. How much should they adjust the taka to dollar exchange rate, and how fast? The decision has been up in the air for quite a while, and economists, business groups, and other stakeholders have joined the chorus, sometimes offering divergent views on the matter.The negative effect of any devaluation is felt immediately by importers, who now have to recover higher costs of the items they sell by raising prices or taking a cut on their profits. If you are in a competitive market, where imported goods vie with domestic products (as is the case of many electronic goods), the higher cost of imported goods results in reduced demand for the imported item and boosts the sale of local substitutes. The moral of this story is, devaluation helps domestic industries and facilitates ""import substitution,"" providing a boost for exporters.Local reactions to fast and steep devaluation are expected to be mixed. ""Devaluation of taka should be gradual"" was the call made by Mostafa Kamal of Meghna Group of Industries. He and some other businesspeople have cautioned the government against drastic action, arguing currency depreciation might ""have a huge impact on every sphere of the economy and life.""His view was echoed by many others I spoke to. One businessman, who sells Microsoft products, reported that the price of an MS Windows license has already jumped since March 2022 by Tk 3,000-4,000. The members of the FBCCI are openly voicing their concerns regarding the increase in the interbank price of the dollar from Tk 84 to Tk 108.Domestically, inflation has caught families with fixed budgets completely off-guard. Even utilities are becoming costlier. After the gas price hike, a proposal to raise electricity tariffs by 66 percent has been submitted. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Committee has suggested a 58 percent raise for per unit power.Former BB governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed, on the other hand, joined many economists in calling for quick action on adjusting the value of the taka against the dollar to reflect market realities. ""It is time to think about inflation, our competitiveness and exchange rate,"" he said recently. ""The wait-and-see policy will not bring any good. Crises snowballed in Sri Lanka over the last four to five years as the country did not act properly to set things right. I wish Bangladesh will not walk the same path.""Nonetheless, a careful assessment shows that devaluation will hurt the average consumers sharply and will only add marginally to our export earnings. One RMG exporter who was in the US recently told me that the recent down-swing in exports is transitional and will pick up once the war in Ukraine reaches a steady state and US importers take stock of market conditions, particularly the inventory on hand.Bangladesh is dependent on imports; during the first eight months of 2022, it imported goods worth USD 50.2 billion. Of this amount, essential commodities account for 72 percent: USD 5.67 billion for food commodities, 4.41 billion for intermediate goods, 19.28 billion for industrial raw materials and 4.46 billion for petroleum products.The taka has been devalued against the dollar in seven steps this year. This measure adds to the cost of business. The Bangladesh Bank has resisted mounting pressures on the taka for a while, but it is increasingly running out of options. The exchange rate of the dollar against the Bangladeshi taka was Tk 84.9 on January 1, 2020. On August 15, 2022, the rate went up and is currently Tk 95, with a decline of the value of the taka by 12 percent. While this is a significant decrease, the currency has held up better than many others. Currencies of the world's top economies, as well as those of our neighbouring countries, have lost their value against the US dollar. India has spent more than 10 percent of its reserves on interventions in the foreign exchange market, which are down USD 27 billion.There is a silver lining in this bleak scenario. The BB has taken several steps to stem demand for foreign exchange and curb inflation – by raising the repo rate, raising the deposit margin on letters of credit of imports of non-essential items, and restrictions on imports of luxury items. The government has decided to go slow on major projects to manage the import bill of construction materials and hardware.Going forward, Bangladesh Bank can consider a policy regime where exchange rate interventions will not be needed on a regular basis. The Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman had proposed a system where a currency can float a little above and a little below a target rate within a narrow band. This system, also known as ""broad target zones,"" and followed by China among others, would require market intervention only if the market rate drifts far away from the ""fix,"" an exchange rate set by Bangladesh Bank.Dr Abdullah Shibli is an economist and works for Change Healthcare, Inc., an information technology company.

/business/news/coordinated-efforts-needed-cut-inflation-south-asia-3143451,‘Coordinated efforts needed to cut inflation in south Asia’,"Coordinated efforts are needed to cut inflation and increase trade in the south Asian countries, experts said at the daylong SAFA International Conference 2022 today.The Covid-induced economic slowdown disrupted the global supply chain, which got further aggravated by the Russia-Ukraine war, they said.In the post-pandemic world, when all global powers are rethinking about their value chains, South Asian countries must think about further enhancing sub-regional cooperation, they added.They spoke at the conference of the South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) hosted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) at Pan Pacific Sonargaon in Dhaka.At the event, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said Bangladesh should now work for strengthening its regional connectivity and raise its trade with the South Asian peers to ensure sustainable growth on its way to becoming a developing country by 2026.""We have many challenges. However, we can go forward by working together regionally.""There is no shortage of rationale for increasing regional trade cooperation among South Asian countries, said Bangladesh Bank's former governor Atiur Rahman.The trade between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal increased by six times between 2015 and 2019, he said.But still unexploited regional trade potential for Bangladesh remains to be as high as 93 per cent, he added.To utilise the untapped potential, South Asian countries need to invest more on improving regional connectivity, he suggested.Rahman made the remarks while presenting a keynote paper on regional connectivity for sustainable growth.Prof Dr Javed Siddiqui of the accounting and finance division in Alliance Manchester Business School UK, gave a keynote speech on the event's technical session one moderated by Bangladesh Bank Board Director Mahbub Ahmed.Senior Commerce Secretary Tapan Kanti Ghosh moderated the technical session two where ICAB's Council Member Sabbir Ahmed presented another keynote paper on ""Current trend of regional economy: role of Professional Accountancy Organizations"".ICAB President Md Shahadat Hossain also spoke.ICAB organised the last SAFA Conference in 2019."
/sports/football/news/real-madrid-know-how-orchestrate-campaigns-win-the-ballon-dor-3143251,'Real Madrid know how to orchestrate campaigns to win the Ballon d'Or',"The director of France Football, Pascal Ferre, remains silent on the identity of the next winner of the Ballon d'Or, which will be known this Monday, and in the face of Karim Benzema's status as favourite, he spoke of how Real Madrid know how to orchestrate campaigns to propel their players towards the award.""Florentino Perez orchestrates the campaigns well, tacitly, without drifts, everything he does is authorised,"" Ferre said in an interview with EFE.The head of the magazine that has been awarding the prize since 1956 says that campaigns ""don't make you win, but they can make you lose when there is a bad message or a bad gesture"".""There are machines like Real Madrid that are very strong. Their intelligence is that they support a single player. For years it was Cristiano Ronaldo and now it's Karim Benzema. That prevents votes from being dispersed,"" he says.""They know how it works. It's no coincidence that they're the club that have won it the most times,"" says Ferre in the office he has occupied since 2005.Off the pitch
Ferre recalls that off-field reputation is also a criterion when awarding points, but does not believe that the conviction for complicity in blackmail handed down against Benzema should be an obstacle to him becoming the first Frenchman to win the award since Zinedine Zidane in 1998.""I think that has already been taken into account by the juries, but I don't think it is an essential element. The Ballon d'Or is not the Nobel Peace Prize, they have voted on eleven months of competition,"" he said.Messi's omission
 









For the first time in 15 years, Lionel Messi, winner of seven editions, does not appear among the candidates, ""a gigantic event in the history of the award"", according to Ferre, who considers that ""the Ballon d'Or is Messi and Messi is the Ballon d'Or"".
""His record is going to be very difficult to match, he is someone who embodies the Ballon d'Or well, because he combines individual and collective performance, but also a certain idea of showmanship and longevity,"" he says. He remembers the Argentinian being ""tremendously excited"" when he called him on the last two occasions to announce that he was the winner.
""In 2019 he told me that he had forgotten the pleasure of winning it (three years after the last one), he had realised that he missed it. In 2021 I had the impression that I was talking to a child,"" he says.
Cristiano's emotion

He also recalls Cristiano Ronaldo's excitement when he was announced in several editions and believes that the Portuguese ""has not digested being left behind his great rival"".
""It is a very important award for them. The Ballon d'Or is one of the few things you can't buy. It makes them humble in the face of this kind of reward, it makes them like children,"" he adds.
Messi and Ronaldo ""have been the protagonists of one of the most intense rivalries in the history of sport"", says Ferre, happy that the Ballon d'Or has helped to fuel it, while considering that it will be some time before a similar duel is repeated.
""There is a lot of talk about the rivalry between Mbappe and Haaland, but neither of them have won the Champions League. At Mbappe's age, Messi already had two Ballon d'Ors. If they want to establish a similar rivalry they have to start winning major trophies now. Messi and Ronaldo didn't take that long,"" he says.
Ferre is aware that the Ballon d'Or is not without controversy ""because everyone has their favourites"", but when he reviews the list of winners he believes that ""there is no one who has disgraced the award"".
Xavi and Iniesta, a scar

""I don't think anyone is missing from the list. It's obvious that there are some names missing. In my opinion there are three, Poland's Robert Lewandowski and Spain's Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta,"" he admits.
""For me it's a big scar, because (Xavi and Iniesta) are two players who I rank very highly and who embody football as the Ballon d'Or sees it. But in 2010 they were up against Messi and I think they paid for the fact that, in that Spanish national team, the votes were divided between many names, which reduced their support.""
He knows that, for many, Raul Gonzalez is another of those absent from the list of winners, but he believes that ""he is a step below"" and recalls that he never won the World Cup.
On Lewandowski, Ferre also regrets that the Pole did not win it in 2020, when he was the big favourite but France Football decided not to award it because of the pandemic.
""We did it out of a desire to be fair, not all the championships had stopped. Robert keeps asking me if I don't regret it, but I think we did the right thing,"" he says.
For a few days now, his phone has been ringing off the hook. ""Representatives, clubs, players... they want to know if they've won, it's inevitable.""
The winner of 2022 already knows that he will embrace the golden trophy next Monday. Ferre has already gone through the usual ceremony of announcing it in person at his home.
""We try to keep it as secret as possible. Sometimes we disguise ourselves so that no one sees us arrive. And we tell the winner not to tell his wife or children,"" he says.

/weekend-read/news/unbearable-burden-unemployed-youth-3143096,Unbearable burden on unemployed youth,"The decision to increase the job application fees for government jobs, except for cadre posts, has outraged the country's millions of job seekers who find it an additional burden on them, making their expenses heavier.According to the new circular issued by the finance ministry on September 22, application fees for posts of different grades have been increased up to two to three times the previous rate.For instance, the application fee for 9th-grade jobs has now been fixed at Tk 600. Previously, it was Tk 500, according to the national pay scale 2015.However, the application fee for 10th-grade positions has been kept at Tk 500. There is no fixed application fee for positions from 1st to 8th grades as these are top ranking posts.On the other hand, the fee for 11th to 16th-grade positions rose by Tk 100 to Tk 300. Now the applicants will have to pay Tk 300 as the fees for the 11th and 12th grades, and Tk 200 for the 13th to 16th grades.The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.Earlier, the application fee for 11th to 16th-grade positions was Tk 100, according to the finance ministry circular.The application fee for 17th to 20th-grade positions has doubled to Tk 100 from Tk 50.The jobseekers, many of whom are unemployed, say the move will exert financial pressure on them. Most of them apply for these jobs several times; so they have to spend the additional amount without any return.Even now, many applicants especially those who are from impoverished backgrounds find it extremely difficult to manage enough money to travel to and stay in Dhaka to appear for the job exams.""Many of us may think that Tk 500-600 is an insignificant amount. Yes, it might be when you get a monthly salary. But, for unemployed youth like us, every penny matters a lot,"" said Md Tobarak Hossain, a National University graduate who has been applying for government jobs for three years.""After the pandemic, many government organisations are posting job circulars. Last month, I applied for four positions and had to pay around Tk 2,000 as application fees. I had to struggle a lot to collect this money as I have no income currently. Increasing application fees in such a time will prove to be a massive blow for us,"" he said.I am struggling to collect money for submitting applications in October while saving some for the exams in November and December. This type of recruitment system where unemployed people have to pay a hefty amount is unjust.
Another jobseeker, Sumaya Khanam said apart from the application fees, they need to spend a huge amount of money for travel to take the recruitment tests.
""In August, I had to travel to Dhaka from my hometown Dinajpur three times to sit for those exams. I had to spend around Tk 15,000 that month just to travel to and stay in Dhaka to appear at the exams,"" she said.
There are several written exams coming up in November and December and application submission deadlines in October, she said.
""I am struggling to collect money for submitting applications in October while saving some for the exams in November and December. This type of recruitment system where unemployed people have to pay a hefty amount is unjust.""
Again, jobseekers are apprehensive that the finance ministry's move will encourage public sector enterprises to increase their application fee as they have been exempted in the circular.
Job application fees set by these organisations are already much higher than the usual fees for other government jobs.
This correspondent analysed recently published 10 circulars of different public enterprises and found that application fees range from Tk 700 to over Tk 1,000.
For instance, Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) published a circular for recruiting medical officers where the application fee was Tk 1,000.
Similarly, Rural Power Company Limited published a job circular for positions ranging from grade 10 to grade 4. However, the application fee for all applicants was Tk 1,000.
Khulna Development Authority published a circular for 16 positions. For the positions of assistant engineer (9th grade) and sub-assistant engineer (10th grade), the application fee was Tk 700. For all other positions, the application fee was Tk 500.
On the other hand, Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited (DPDC) will recruit 33 assistant engineers and the application fee it charged was Tk 1,500.
""If these state-run enterprises also increase the job application fees following the finance ministry's decision, it will be impossible for us to apply for many of these jobs. The government has been imposing an unbearable burden on us in the name of job application fees and recruitment exams,"" said Sumaya.
The finance ministry, however, claims that they have not increased the application fees, it was ""adjusted"" for the benefit of the job seekers.
Md Golam Mostofa, additional secretary (regulation) of the finance ministry, told The Daily Star, ""Previously application fee for 9th-grade and 10th-grade jobs was the same. We have just slightly increased the fee for 9th-grade positions but did not increase the latter.""
The application fee for positions of 11th to 16th grade was the same but their salary was not equal. ""So, we have re-adjusted the application according to the grade of the positions in accordance with the pay scale,"" he said.
Golam Mostofa said the government does not intend to earn from the application fees. Even the application fees barely cover 10 percent of the expenditure required to arrange job exams.
""We take these fees as a token money from the job seekers so that they take the exams seriously.""
Asked how this decision will be enforced and why the state-run enterprises have been exempted, he commented, ""The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.""
""State-run enterprises are supposed to run on their own income. This is why we have exempted them from this measure,"" he added.
Experts, however, have opined against this step saying that the step would cause suffering for millions of job seekers and unemployed youths.
Former Cabinet Secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, ""We expected the government would decrease job application fees considering the current economic situation. Increasing application fees at this time when many people have been suffering from income loss due to the pandemic is not the appropriate step.
""There can be a fee for applying for government jobs but that fee has to be nominal and affordable for all citizens.""

/daily-star-books/news/love-fate-and-age-old-curses-the-book-magic-alice-hoffman-3143441,"Love, fate, and age-old curses: 'The Book of Magic' by Alice Hoffman","Jet Owens has only seven days to live. With the deathwatch beetle following her everywhere, Jet knows that her time has come. In her late 80s, Jet is a kind, warm woman, trying her best to help those in need. Yet, her life seems unfulfilled and there is one last thing she needs to take care of before embracing death. What is it, then, that is bothering a woman in this seemingly late chapter of her life?As Alice Hoffman unfolds the story in this book and brings an end to her The Practical Magic (Simon Schuster, 2020) series, readers find the enchanted Owens women embarking on a menacing journey that involves coming in close contact with the Dark side or ""left-handed"" magic, as the author puts it.An adventurous young adult read, full of enchantments, emotions, and familial bond, The Book of Magic (Simon & Schuster, 2021) is something readers might relish if they are looking to read in the supernatural/fantasy genre. Set across the United States of America and England, the book follows the mystical Owens women who have set out on a journey in order to break a curse that has steered their lives for centuries. Whoever they fall in love with meets with an untimely death. How can one bear to live while a loved one is perishing right in front of their eyes? The readers confront such questions throughout the entire novel that connects them to the storyline easily. As the narrative unfolds, the writer tells of a curse that has loomed over the family members for centuries, and Jet Owens sets off on a mission to end it while the deathwatch beetle keeps clicking away. She goes to the library and seeks out ""The Book of the Raven"", a book that holds the key to ending the notorious curse. Yet, the path is as difficult as can be since the one who embarks upon it will lose something precious. While Jet breathes her last and is buried beside her childhood sweetheart, a series of tragic events take place in the Owens family. Gideon, the love of Kylie's life, is met with a sudden accident. As he is lying in the hospital bed battling for his life, Kylie realises that the abrupt catastrophe and Gideon's critical condition are all but a work of the curse. She sets out on a dangerous journey to rectify their circumstances and quickly finds herself in a place where Gideon's isn't the only life hanging by a thread.The familial bond portrayed in the novel makes it easy to sympathise with the characters and they rarely seem woven in a piece of fiction; rather, their attributes are more lifelike and one may just find someone like Franny or Gillian Owens among their kith and kin. However, the family line in the novel can be a little difficult to decipher and the descriptions sometimes come off as too dense. Nonetheless, Alice Hoffman weaves the ending well and The Book of Magic is perhaps some sort of a closure, being the last one in the series of four.Shejuti Pasha loves reading along with a cup of coffee.

/business/economy/opinion/news/asia-sails-headwinds-rate-hikes-war-and-china-slowdown-3143256,"Asia sails into headwinds from rate hikes, war, and China slowdown","Asia's strong economic rebound early this year is losing momentum, with a weaker-than-expected second quarter. We have cut growth forecasts for Asia and the Pacific to 4 per cent this year and 4.3 per cent next year, which are well below the 5.5 per cent average over the last two decades. Despite this, Asia remains a relative bright spot in an increasingly dimming global economy.Waning momentum reflects three formidable headwinds, which may prove to be persistent:A sharp tightening of financial conditions, which is raising government borrowing costs and is likely to become even more constricting, as central banks in major advanced economies continue to raise interest rates to tame the fastest inflation in decades. Rapidly depreciating currencies could further complicate policy challenges.Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is still raging and continues to trigger a sharp slowdown of economic activity in Europe that will further reduce external demand for Asian exports.China's strict zero-COVID policy and the related lockdowns, which, coupled with a deepening turmoil in the real estate sector, has led to an uncharacteristic and sharp slowdown in growth, that in turn is weakening momentum in connected economies.BROAD SLOWDOWNAfter near-zero growth in the second quarter, China will recover modestly in the second half to reach full-year growth of 3.2 per cent and accelerate to 4.4 per cent next year, assuming pandemic restrictions are gradually loosened.In Japan, we expect growth to remain unchanged at 1.7 per cent this year before slowing to 1.6 per cent next year, weighed down by weak external demand. Korea's growth in 2022 was revised up to 2.6 per cent due to a strong second-quarter growth but revised down to 2 per cent in 2023 reflecting external headwinds. India's economy will expand, albeit more slowly than previously expected, by 6.8 per cent this year and 6.1 per cent in 2023, owing to a weakening of external demand and a tightening of monetary and financial conditions that are expected to weigh on growth.Southeast Asia is likely to enjoy a strong recovery. In Vietnam, which is benefitting from its growing importance in global supply chains, we expect 7 per cent growth and a slight moderation next year. The Philippines is forecast to see a 6.5 per cent expansion this year, while growth will top 5 per cent in Indonesia and Malaysia.Cambodia and Thailand will expand faster in 2023 on a likely pickup in foreign tourism. In Myanmar, which has endured a deep recession due to the coup and pandemic, growth this year is expected to stabilise at a low level amid continued unrest and suffering.The outlook is more challenging for other Asian frontier markets. Sri Lanka is still experiencing a severe economic crisis, though the authorities have reached an agreement with IMF staff on a programme that will help to stabilise the economy.In Bangladesh, the war in Ukraine and high commodity prices has dampened a robust recovery from the pandemic. The authorities have preemptively requested an IMF-supported programme that will bolster the external position, and access to the IMF's new Resilience and Sustainability Trust to meet their large climate financing need, both of which will strengthen their ability to deal with future shocks.High debt economies such as the Maldives, Lao P.D.R., and Papua New Guinea, and those facing refinancing risks, like Mongolia, are also facing challenges as the tide changes.We expect growth across Pacific Island countries to rebound strongly next year to 4.2 per cent from 0.8 per cent this year as tourism-based economies benefit from eased travel restrictions.INFLATION REMAINS ELEVATEDInflation now exceeds central bank targets in most Asian economies, driven by a mix of global food and energy prices, currencies falling against the US dollar, and shrinking output gaps. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has also risen and its persistence—driven by inflation expectations and wages—must be closely monitored.Meanwhile, the US dollar has strengthened against most major currencies as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and signals further hikes to come. Most Asian emerging market currencies have lost between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of their value against the dollar this year, while the yen has depreciated by more than 20 per cent. These recent depreciations have started passing through to core inflation across the region, and this may keep inflation high for longer than previously expected.Finally, spikes in global food and energy prices early this year threatened to abruptly raise the cost of living across the region, with particularly strong implications for the real incomes of lower-income households that spend more of their disposable income on these commodities.POLICY FOR CHALLENGING TIMESAmid lower growth, policymakers face complex challenges that will require strong responses.Central banks will need to persevere with their policy tightening until inflation durably falls back to target. Exchange rates should be allowed to adjust to reflect fundamentals, including the terms of trade—a measure of prices for a country's exports relative to its imports—and foreign monetary policy decisions.But if global shocks lead to a spike in borrowing rates unrelated to domestic policy changes and/or threaten financial stability or undermine the central bank's ability to stabilise inflation expectations, foreign-exchange interventions may become a useful part of the policy mix for countries with adequate reserves, alongside macroprudential policies.Countries should urgently consider improving their liquidity buffers, including by requesting access to precautionary instruments from the Fund for those eligible.Public debt has risen substantially in Asia over the past 15 years—particularly in the advanced economies and China—and rose further during the pandemic. Fiscal policy should continue its gradual consolidation to moderate demand alongside monetary policy, focused on the medium-term goal of stabilising public debt.Accordingly, measures to shield vulnerable populations from the rising cost of living will need to be well-targeted and temporary. In countries with high debt levels, support will need to be budget-neutral to maintain the path of fiscal consolidation. Credible medium-term fiscal frameworks remain an imperative.Beyond the short term, policies must focus on healing the damage inflicted by the pandemic and war. Scarring from the pandemic and current headwinds are likely to be sizable in Asia, in part because of elevated leverage among companies that will weigh on private investment and education losses from school closures that could erode human capital if remedial measures aren't taken today.Strong international cooperation is needed to prevent greater geoeconomic fragmentation and to ensure that trade aids growth. There is an urgent need for ambitious structural changes to boost the region's productive potential and address the climate crisis.Krishna Srinivasan is the director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the International Monetary Fund.  Shanaka Jayanath Peiris is the Asia and Pacific Department's Division Chief of Regional Studies."

/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/doob-20-plea-save-the-citys-biodiversity-3143416,‘Doob 2.0’- A plea to save the city’s biodiversity,"The inauguration of 'Doob 2.0- a miniaturesque art exhibition' took place at the EMK Center, Dhanmondi 27, on September 24, 2022. Initiated by Azizee Fawmi Khan, Doob 2.0 is an attempt to point out the changes in our biodiversity caused by gradual urbanisation.Back in the 20th century, Dhaka city was a flourishing place with birds and other animals, and more green spaces. But alas! Our greed for built spaces has destroyed the natural beauty of the city. All we can see around us is a concrete jungle. The water bodies, the green areas, the birds and other small animals- they are hardly to be seen. The artists of Doob 2.0 bring us the images of the previous version of Dhaka versus the current one, blended with nostalgia and undying yearning.The miniaturesque pieces have filled the mini exhibition hall of EMK center. The first pair of artworks on the wall is called Leaf Story, Taniya Rahman Roshney's hand embroidery of houseplants on canvas, her fond memories of student life, and her friendship with nature. Mukta Mareeam Khan has used natural ingredients for her art piece, painting adorable frogs asking for rain on summer days. She was inspired by the folktales of her village and the folk song 'Ashare Golpo', that she sang herself.The cutest artwork I found was Arzina Ahasan's 'Unnoticed'. On her quest to frame unnoticed beauty of nature, the artist used grass, leaves, flowers, shells, and wooden scraps to recreate the biodiversity of her native village. Her work mainly focuses on portraying birds and plants, which she made permanent with resin.Another remarkable work is Nusrat Jahan Titly's 'Recreational Apiarist' is a memoir of her grandfather's love for bees.She wonders when was the last time a beehive formed naturally where she lives in. She used a wooden frame, recycles paper, and beads to form a beehive with intricate details. Sarah Jabin's 'Home Sweet Home' is a soap composite carving of columns from ancient civilisations, where she made little spaces to accommodate animals and birds.Afroza Hossain Sara used songs, drawing, and motions to hand-draw a digital animation of the cranes around Banani lake that, despite the pollution, population, and climate change. Ananya Mehpar Azad did a gorgeous portrayal of the goddess Dhakeshwari, the protector of Dhaka city, surrounded by her long lost rich biodiversity using fabric color and sequin embellishment on silk.Aside from these, all the other artists have produced remarkable art pieces that represent a desperate call for the protection of nature, along with their charming aesthetics. EMK Center will run this exhibition till October 22, 2022. "

Similar rallies have been planned in other divisional headquarters to drum up support in the run up to the next election expected to be held late next year or in early 2024.The BNP will conclude the divisional rallies through a mass gathering in Dhaka city on December 10."

Renuka then nicked off Harshitha Samarawickrama to add to their misery; the other opener Anushka Sanjeewani was also run out while attempting to complete a tight single.Renuka added two more to her figures and the spinners settled in, leaving Sri Lanka in dire straits at 16-5.Inoka Ranaweera top-scored with 18 runs as the reeling Lankans played out the 20 overs posting 65.Besides, Renuka's three, left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad and off-spinner Sneh Rana picked up two wickets each, while Deepti Sharma, who topped the wicket-takers chart, went wicketless.In reply, India lost experienced opener Shafali Verma for five and Jemimah Rodrigues for two inside the powerplay but Smriti motored on and smashed an unbeaten 51 runs off 25 balls as she hit six fours and three sixes and hit the winning runs with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur at the other end.""We should credit our bowlers. Our fielding unit was good from ball one and we discussed that we should not give away easy runs. You have to read the wicket and accordingly place the fielders in the right positions. We read the wicket well and position fielders accordingly. We were not looking at the scoreboard but only decided on five-over targets. We never thought about what is the total on the board and batted accordingly,"" the India skipper said in the post-match interview.Deepti was adjudged the player of the tournament for her all-round exploits, including 13 wickets and a useful 94 runs."
/business/economy/opinion/news/how-countries-should-respond-the-strong-dollar-3143241,How countries should respond to the strong dollar,"The dollar is at its highest level since 2000, having appreciated 22 per cent against the yen, 13 per cent against the euro and 6 per cent against emerging market currencies since the start of this year. Such a sharp strengthening of the dollar in a matter of months has sizable macroeconomic implications for almost all countries, given the dominance of the dollar in international trade and finance.While the US share in world merchandise exports has declined from 12 per cent to 8 per cent since 2000, the dollar's share in world exports has held around 40 per cent. For many countries fighting to bring down inflation, the weakening of their currencies relative to the dollar has made the fight harder.On average, the estimated pass-through of a 10 per cent dollar appreciation into inflation is 1 per cent. Such pressures are especially acute in emerging markets, reflecting their higher import dependency and greater share of dollar-invoiced imports compared with advanced economies.The dollar's appreciation also is reverberating through balance sheets around the world. Approximately half of all cross-border loans and international debt securities are denominated in US dollars. While emerging market governments have made progress in issuing debt in their own currency, their private corporate sectors have high levels of dollar-denominated debt.As world interest rates rise, financial conditions have tightened considerably for many countries. A stronger dollar only compounds these pressures, especially for some emerging market and many low-income countries that are already at a high risk of debt distress.In these circumstances, should countries actively support their currencies? Several countries are resorting to foreign exchange interventions. Total foreign reserves held by emerging market and developing economies fell by more than 6 per cent in the first seven months of this year.The appropriate policy response to depreciation pressures requires a focus on the drivers of the exchange rate change and on signs of market disruptions. Specifically, foreign exchange intervention should not substitute for warranted adjustment to macroeconomic policies. There is a role for intervening on a temporary basis when currency movements substantially raise financial stability risks and/or significantly disrupt the central bank's ability to maintain price stability.As of now, economic fundamentals are a major factor in the appreciation of the dollar: rapidly rising US interest rates and a more favourable terms-of-trade—a measure of prices for a country's exports relative to its imports—for the US caused by the energy crisis.Fighting a historic increase in inflation, the Federal Reserve has embarked on a rapid tightening path for policy interest rates. The European Central Bank, while also facing broad-based inflation, has signaled a shallower path for their policy rates, out of concern that the energy crisis will cause an economic downturn. Meanwhile, low inflation in Japan and China has allowed their central banks to buck the global tightening trend.The massive terms-of-trade shock triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the second major driver behind the dollar's strength. The euro area is highly reliant on energy imports, in particular natural gas from Russia. The surge in gas prices has brought its terms of trade to the lowest level in the history of the shared currency.As for emerging markets and developing economies beyond China, many were ahead in the global monetary tightening cycle—perhaps in part out of concern about their dollar exchange rate—while commodity exporting EMDEs experienced a positive terms-of-trade shock. Consequently, exchange-rate pressures for the average emerging market economy have been less severe than for advanced economies, and some, such as Brazil and Mexico, have even appreciated.Given the significant role of fundamental drivers, the appropriate response is to allow the exchange rate to adjust, while using monetary policy to keep inflation close to its target. The higher price of imported goods will help bring about the necessary adjustment to the fundamental shocks as it reduces imports, which in turn helps with reducing the buildup of external debt. Fiscal policy should be used to support the most vulnerable without jeopardising inflation goals.Additional steps are also needed to address several downside risks on the horizon. Importantly, we could see far greater turmoil in financial markets, including a sudden loss of appetite for emerging market assets that prompts large capital outflows, as investors retreat to safe assets.ENHANCE RESILIENCEIn this fragile environment, it is prudent to enhance resilience. Although emerging market central banks have stockpiled dollar reserves in recent years, reflecting lessons learned from earlier crises, these buffers are limited and should be used prudently.Countries must preserve vital foreign reserves to deal with potentially worse outflows and turmoil in the future. Those that are able should reinstate swap lines with advanced-economy central banks.Countries with sound economic policies in need of addressing moderate vulnerabilities should proactively avail themselves of the IMF's precautionary lines to meet future liquidity needs. Those with large foreign-currency debts should reduce foreign-exchange mismatches by using capital-flow management or macroprudential policies, in addition to debt management operations to smooth repayment profiles.In addition to fundamentals, with financial markets tightening, some countries are seeing signs of market disruptions such as rising currency hedging premia and local currency financing premia. Severe disruptions in shallow currency markets would trigger large changes in these premia, potentially causing macroeconomic and financial instability.In such cases, temporary foreign exchange intervention may be appropriate. This can also help prevent adverse financial amplification if a large depreciation increases financial stability risks, such as corporate defaults, due to mismatches.Finally, temporary intervention can also support monetary policy in the rare circumstances where a large exchange rate depreciation could de-anchor inflation expectations, and monetary policy alone cannot restore price stability.For the United States, despite the global fallout from a strong dollar and tighter global financial conditions, monetary tightening remains the appropriate policy while US inflation remains so far above target. Not doing so would damage central bank credibility, de-anchor inflation expectations, and necessitate even more tightening later—and greater spillovers to the rest of the world.That said, the Fed should keep in mind that large spillovers are likely to spill back into the US economy. In addition, as a global provider of the world's safe asset, the US could reactivate currency swap lines to eligible countries, as it extended at the start of the pandemic, to provide an important safety valve in times of currency market stress. These would usefully complement dollar funding provided by the Fed's standing Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility.The IMF will continue to work closely with our members to craft appropriate macroeconomic policies in these turbulent times, relying on our Integrated Policy Framework. Beyond precautionary financing facilities available for eligible countries, the IMF stands ready to extend our lending resources to member countries experiencing balance of payments problems.Gita Gopinath is the First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund.

We often see glamorous international fashion shows on television or social media, but how often do our local fashion designers get the right podium? From an economic perspective if designers in Dhaka city offer more fashion shows it will generate a huge amount of revenue for our fashion industry. Fashion shows create numerous opportunities for brands, designers, models, photographers, editors, influencers, and celebrities. If we look into international fashion shows, nowadays, they are less open to the public and are generally organised by the brands or the authorised fashion bodies. Previously, fashion designers unveiled their latest collections via runway shows for their potential buyers and editors, but since 1993 when the New York Fashion Show took place, it has taken the international fashion industry to the next level. New York, Paris, Milan, and London all the famous fashion cities now offer fashion weeks. They bring out four different seasonal collections each year. Indian fashion designers also get to showcase their work via Lakme Fashion Week twice a year. Many fashion influencers visit these series of fashion events; it is a great way for purchasing haute couture and building your network within the industry.Bangladesh has a broad collection of quality handloom fabrics used by many well-established local designers. Our heritage designs and patterns are rich, sophisticated, sustainable, and most importantly handmade. Most fabrics are made from natural dyes, keeping in mind the environment, culture, and religion. The traditional Jamdani and Benaroshi saris are a huge part of our handloom woven culture, and if we as a fashion industry offer more fashion shows we will be able to promote our legacy even further. Many artisans work more than 180 hours behind each hand-embroidered sari or shalwar kameez. The practice of traditional motifs, nakshi kanthas, and block prints are all narrating beautiful stories about the history of Bangladeshi fashion, most of which are fading away due to the lack of exposure.Bangladeshi fashion designers who make handcrafted leather footwear and timeless jute bags could use the fashion shows to highlight their quality work to become global. Through this process, the long-lived tradition of handmade embroidery will stay alive. I believe it is always important to remember our brown roots and acknowledge our diverse bridal couture collections. Indian and Pakistani bridal collections are outstanding, but what if we have our own Bangladeshi bridal couture week? Now that is something to talk about and of course, it will help our customers to wear something made in Bangladesh for their special day. The rich heritage of Bangladeshi fabric can only grow through more fashion shows, digital media, and an eco-friendly environment. Fashion shows can be a tool for public awareness, they can create enthusiasm among the audience to purchase sustainable and reusable masterpieces. As our industry always battles against fast fashion and tries to create earth-friendly designer products. Fashion shows can help designers to reach out to more people and educate them to buy fewer but more valuable outfits. The moment you wear your grandmother's traditional sari at your university convocation, you are not only remembering her but also carrying the family heritage of being a brown child. It is like what Coco Chanel once said, ""Every day is a fashion show and the world is your runway""In recent years Instagram has been one of the biggest game changers for the fashion industry, many brands go live during their fashion shows to reach out to their followers directly. According to Forbes magazine, ""Social media provides all relevant guidance for the fashion shows nowadays, each post shared by celebrities creates a big impact on the designer's new collection."" In a recent Fendi fashion show they used throne to live telecast the entire show on social media. We have also seen Givenchy experience their fashion show with all plus-size models to grab the full attention of Gen Z. If we have more frequent fashion shows in Dhaka and promote them through Instagram, it will be a great source of constant connection between the designers and the customers. The shows can invite fashion experts and bloggers to associate with the global fashion market. It can provide a great place to meet new creative people who share the same passion, enabling a chance to view the hard work of our local fashion designers.In modern times fashion shows have become a piece of art, they work on the theme, stage, and choreography and hire a huge team for the production. If Dhaka offers more fashion shows there will be room for so many new job opportunities for creative younger graduates. Bangladeshi fashion industry deserves to be globally recognised and I believe more fashion shows will help us focus on our trademark designs, craftsmanship, and sustainability. "
