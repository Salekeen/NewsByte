That's why we stopped the voting immediately. If the commission thinks that the election is not being held properly, then it can stop it,"" he also said.""We can see that a lot has gone out of control. You have also seen what is happening in the secret room and that the elections are not being held in an orderly manner. But I can't immediately tell you why this is happening,"" the CEC added.Suggesting that human behaviour is at wrong here, as people other than the voters are entering and directing who to vote, he said that ""we can't say at the moment whether the law enforcement agencies are working properly or not. I don't see any defects in EVMs either.""""This is against an orderly election. They are robbers, they are miscreants. We can address those who do not obey the law, as robbers and miscreants. Because everyone has to respect the law. If everyone does not obey the law, the Election Commission will not be able to sit here and deliver a beautiful election,"" he added.Earlier, all candidates of Gaibandha-5 (Fulchhari-Saghata) by-elections, except the Awami League nominated candidate, boycotted the polls.The four candidates announced their decision in a press conference held at Bagervita Government Primary School premises in Saghata Upazila around 11:30 am.Meanwhile, Election Commission (EC) postponed voting at 40 polling stations in the by-polls over ""Irregularities"".Voting began at 88 centres in Saghata upazila and 57 in Fulchhari upazila at 8am today (October 12, 2022).Voting is being held through Electronic Voting machines (EVMs) for the first time at 952 booths in 145 centers.Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said, ""We are directly monitoring the election commission through CCTV.""Asked about the reasons, he said, ""We won't say this!  We have seen irregularities, that's why. There were serious irregularities. """"We are the Election Commission, the independent commission.…There have been some irregularities, no fair election was being held there. It will not reflect the public opinion. That's why we postponed voting at those centers.""We are monitoring the situation further,"" the chief election commissioner said.The seat fell vacant on July 23 of this year when Deputy Speaker Fazle Rabbi Miah, the then lawmaker of Gaibandha-5 constituency died while undergoing treatment at a hospital in the US.The five candidates are contesting the seat are- Awami League nominee Md Mahmud Hasan, Jatiya Party nominee HM Golam Shahid Ronju, Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh's Jahangir Alam, independent candidate Nahiduzzaman Nishad and, another independent candidate Syed Mahbubur Rahman.The total number of voters in the constituency is 3,39,743."
/business/news/biden-vows-consequences-saudi-arabia-after-opec-decision-3140751,Biden vows consequences for Saudi Arabia after OPEC decision,"President Joe Biden pledged on Tuesday ""there will be consequences"" for US relations with Saudi Arabia after OPEC+ announced last week that it would cut oil production over US objections.His announcement came a day after powerful Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States must immediately freeze all cooperation with Saudi Arabia, including arms sales.Biden, in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, would not discuss what options he was considering.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said a policy review would be conducted but gave no timeline for action or information on who would lead the re-evaluation. The United States will be watching the situation closely ""over the coming weeks and months,"" she said.OPEC+ announced plans for an oil production cut last week after weeks of lobbying against one by US officials. The United States accused Saudi Arabia of kowtowing to Russia, which objects to a Western cap on the price of Russian oil spurred by the Ukraine invasion.US officials had been quietly trying to persuade its biggest Arab partner to nix the idea of a production cut, but Saudi Arabia's de factor ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was not swayed.Bin Salman and Biden had clashed during Biden's visit to Jeddah in July over the death in 2018 of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a source familiar with the situation.US intelligence says the crown prince approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, a Saudi insider-turned-critic, who was murdered and dismembered by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.The prince, son of King Salman, 86, has denied ordering the killing but acknowledged it took place ""under my watch."" Biden said in July he told the prince he thought he was responsible.John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, said Biden would work with Congress ""to think through what that relationship ought to look like going forward.""""And I think he's going to be willing to start to have those conversations right away. I don't think this is anything that's going to have to wait or should wait, quite frankly, for much longer,"" Kirby added.State Department spokesperson Ned Price also said on Tuesday the Biden administration would not overlook Iran, a US adversary and a bitter regional rival of Saudi Arabia, in the review. read moreMuch of US arms sales to Saudi Arabia have been made with Iran's threat in the region in mind.""There are security challenges, some of which emanate from Iran. Certainly, we won't take our eye off the threat that Iran poses not only to the region, but in some ways beyond,"" Price said."
/news/bangladesh/politics/news/bnp-rally-ctg-many-barred-bcl-jubo-league-men-the-way-3140741,"BNP rally at Ctg: “BCL, Jubo League men” bar, vandalise vehicles","BNP leaders and activists today alleged that Chhatra league and Jubo League men barred BNP leaders and activists from joining the rally in Chattogram and also vandalised their vehicles.BNP has called for a divisional rally in Chattogram today (October 12, 2022) to protest the deaths of five leaders and activists in police action; rising prices of essential commodities and to demand its chairperson Khaleda Zia's release.Leaders and activists from various districts started gathering the venue of the rally since morning, but they alleged that the police and members of the ruling party obstructed them from joining the rally at many places and attacked their vehicles.BNP leaders and activists claimed that BCL and Jubo League men attacked and vandalised their vehicles on the Dhaka-Chattogram highway, leaving several leaders and activists injured. Feni's Daganbhuiyan Upazila BNP President Md Akbar told The Daily Star, ""Chhatra League and Jubo League men attacked and vandalised seven vehicles, including mine, in front of Mirsarai Nizampur College. Our leaders and activists were injured at the time.""However, Officer-in-Charge (OC) of Mirsarai Police Station, Mojibur Rahman said, ""UNO and police are on the road.

The party men were harassed in the name of checking the documents of the car. Most of the BNP leaders and activists could not be present at the rally venue on time. Many of the vehicles were also sent back midway, they alleged.According to Abdul Mannan, joint-convener of the Khagrachhari Municipal Juba Dal, they were stopped by Jubo League and Chhatra League activists and police at various locations in Matiranga, Manikchhari, and Bariarhat in Mirsarai.

/world/europe/news/europe-blame-energy-crisis-says-putin-3141066,"Europe to blame for energy crisis, says Putin","Russia's president said Europe was to blame for its energy crisis with policies that starved the oil and gas industry of investment and said price caps would make it worse, as EU states tried to forge a deal on ways to contain soaring energy costs.Worries about the security of energy supplies were heightened on Wednesday when a leak in Poland on the Druzhba pipeline from Russia reduced the flow of oil to Germany.Poland said the leak was probably caused by an accident but it came as European Union nations are seeking to wean themselves off a reliance on Russian energy in response to the invasion of Ukraine in February.The Nord Stream gas link to Germany is now out of action after a leak last month that both Russia and the West have blamed on sabotage, without identifying who was behind it.President Vladimir Putin said leaks in the two Nord Stream pipelines running under the Baltic Sea were an ""act of international terrorism"" to deprive people of cheap energy.Putin said gas could still be supplied by one intact part of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline but it was up to the EU whether or not it wanted the gas.Germany froze the Nord Stream 2 project days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine and a German government spokesperson on Wednesday ruled out taking gas via that route.Putin also floated the idea of creating an alternative European gas hub via Turkey.""We could move the lost volumes along the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey,"" Putin told an energy forum in Russia.""That is, of course, if our partners are interested in this. And economic feasibility, of course,"" he said.Putin said Moscow was not to blame for Europe's sky-high energy prices and pointed at the EU's green energy drive, saying it led to underinvestment in the global oil and gas industry.The Group of Seven (G7) countries have been discussing a cap on Russian oil prices, a move Putin said would deepen problems.The impact of efforts to use less Russian energy, plus steep cuts in supplies from Russia, have been felt across the 27-nation EU, with gas prices almost 90% higher than a year ago and fears of rationing and power cuts over the coming winter.PRAGUE TALKSEU energy ministers were meeting in Prague on Wednesday to try to agree new measures to tackle the crisis.Most EU countries say they want a gas price cap, but disagree on its design. Some countries, including Germany, Europe's biggest gas market, remain opposed, arguing it risks choking off supplies.Germany and the Netherlands put forward their own proposals before Wednesday's meeting in the Czech capital - suggesting 10 ""no-regret"" EU measures, including a new benchmark price for liquefied natural gas, tougher targets to save gas, and negotiating lower prices with other suppliers, such as Norway.In neighbouring Poland, pipeline operator PERN said a leak was detected on Tuesday evening in a section of the Druzhba oil pipe around 70 kilometres (43 miles) from the central Polish city of Plock.The Druzhba pipeline, whose name means ""friendship"" in Russian, is one of the world's largest, supplying Russian oil to much of central Europe.""Here we can talk about accidental damage,"" Poland's top official in charge of energy infrastructure Mateusz Berger told Reuters by telephone.Germany's PCK Refinery in the eastern town of Schwedt, which supplies 90% of Berlin's fuel, said it was still receiving oil deliveries from the Druzhba pipeline but at reduced capacity.SUPPORT MEASURESThe energy crisis has had knock-on effects across the whole of Europe as businesses have passed on extra costs, squeezing household budgets.Governments are also trying to figure out how to fund emergency measures taken to protect customers and smooth out the distortions caused by the surge in prices.EU member Portugal plans to inject 3 billion euros ($2.9 billion) into its electricity and natural gas systems to curb prices paid by companies next year, the government said on Wednesday.In Britain, the new government set out plans for a temporary revenue limit on low-carbon electricity generators, which the industry said was a ""de-facto windfall tax"" on renewable energy producers.Rocketing gas prices across Europe and Britain have driven up the cost of electricity."
/opinion/views/news/when-currency-not-arms-the-weapon-choice-3140111,"When currency, not arms, is the weapon of choice","After a relative calm since World War II, we are facing a situation in Ukraine that can flare into a catastrophic nuclear conflict. But it is not only the hard power of hypersonic missiles and nuclear warheads that can be used to score victories. Today, we have much less lethal, yet no less stealthy or tactically inferior weapons – these are the monetary instruments for sinking economies through gradual asphyxiation and disabling the financial capacity of opponents.The use of money for good and bad has a long history, going back to Byzantine solidus – the dollar of the Middle Ages – which projected the might of the eastern Roman empire. The monetary power gradually shifted to silver of the Spanish and later to the British pound sterling as the world's most valued reserve currency.The delinking from the gold standard by President Richard Nixon more than five decades ago was the beginning of the new era of the US' financial dominance. The gold standard was replaced by the dollar as the fiat currency, and all oil deals were denominated in dollars.The emergence of the mighty dollar was backed by gold, and the hegemonic transition in the aftermath of World War II that came with the rise of American geopolitical and military leadership of the Western world. The generous USD 15 billion credit by the US to the war-devastated European countries for reconstruction under the Marshall Plan of 1948 helped in this process.Today, the dollar has unparalleled supremacy. Almost all imports and exports are denominated in dollars. In addition, billions of dollars are transacted globally in the form of small private transactions, such as for travels abroad and repatriation of savings by millions of workers overseas. International transactions between businesses, countries to settle contracts, repay loans – all require dollars. Countries have to keep enough dollar reserves to pay for their import needs for at least six months or face the danger of default, poor credit ranking, and bankruptcy.Globally, USD 12-13 trillion is kept as reserve, much of which is kept with the Federal Reserve System of the US. These reserves work to the advantage of the US, which can (and does) run large budget deficits and take national loans equal to many times its GDP without much concern for bankruptcy.The dominance of the dollar and the hegemonic power which supports it have emerged as a sore point in the rising strategic competition to determine the global financial architecture.Jose Miguel Alonso-Trabanco, an international relations professional, notes, ""In this game of determining suitable financial architecture, monetary assets, control over resources are weaponised as instruments of coercion, manipulation, disruption, subordination and conquest. The realm of money is now at the forefront of rivalry for domination."" The US can and often does weaponise the dollar to support and extend their dominance. Such sanctions can be tolerated to a certain extent, but beyond that, it can backfire through powerful, destructive measures.Unlike the hard power of missiles and war machines, financial power can be used for both construction and destruction, from building alliances, to gradually weakening the economic power of countries. It can be used for patronage or denial, to gradually snap the energy of the ""disfavoured."" Financial power, coupled with another lethal weapon, the ""food diplomacy,"" can cause havoc on countries at the receiving end.Large and small nations can be subjected to its squeeze in different ways. For example, Bangladesh, during its immediate post-liberation period, was subjected to sanctions for selling jute to Cuba, leading to the deaths of thousands of people by starvation through denial of food delivery.In the context of the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the sanctions imposed by the US and the West focused on key elements of financial transactions, choking the Russian economy out of the freedom of exchanging goods and services.What impact are these sanctions expected to have on the Russian economy? It is difficult to assess at this stage. Russia, with about USD 630 billion in foreign exchange and gold reserves, was in a comfortable situation in the pre-war period. The impacts of sanctions are reported to be negative; it is observed by some that in February-May 2022, industrial production went down by nearly 70 percent, imports reduced by 50 percent, and debt portfolio increased to USD 300-400 billion.The Russians countered to stay afloat by denominating exports and imports in terms of rubles, adopting a quasi-barter system among its allies, or with countries dependent on Russia for its oil and gas. But the ruble strengthened, and Russia had to take measures to weaken the ruble for fear of adverse impacts on exports.So far, Russia is doing not so badly. But how long it can sustain the persistent pressure from the US and its Western allies remains to be seen. It could be a close call for a showdown.The key to this lies in the hands of China, another mighty economy with vast financial and commercial reach as well as hard power. It holds huge financial reserves (more than USD 3 trillion and 1,948 tonnes of gold). Allied with China, Russia can deliver a heavy counterpunch.Coercive weaponisation of financial vectors does not involve bloodshed, but it can still inflict substantial damage in terms of hunger and poverty, not necessarily on the target countries, but as unintended ""collateral damage"" on innocent ""bystander"" countries. Already, the rise of inflation and potential food shortages are sending ominous signals. Low-income countries around the world can only wait and see, and build up their own defences to the best of their capabilities against the unwelcome outcome of an ugly bullfight. Dr Atiqur Rahman is an economist, former adjunct professor at John Cabot University in Italy, and former lead strategist at IFAD.

/environment/climate-crisis/climate-loss/news/amazon-hydropower-brazils-people-the-river-pay-the-price-3141046,Amazon hydropower: Brazil's 'people of the river' pay the price,"The waters of the Xingu River below the Belo Monte hydropower dam, in Brazil's Amazon, used to flood the river's forested islands during the rainy season, allowing fish to glide among the trees and gorge on fallen fruit.But since the controversial dam opened six years ago, the forests no longer flood consistently, and the fish have lost a key place to feed and spawn, local people say.""Today, these fruits all fall onto dry land, so the fish can't get the food,"" said Josiel Pereira, an indigenous Juruna man from the village of Miratu, in Para state.During the dry season, in turn, the dam sometimes releases too much water at once, drowning sandy beaches and destroying the nests where turtles have long laid their eggs, said Pereira, who is helping scientists understand the ecological impacts of the dam's construction.""It has been very difficult for us to survive after the Belo Monte dam development,"" he said in an interview. ""It has caused a lot of impact on our food, on our source of income.""Estimated to cost at least 40 billion Brazilian real ($7.6 billion), the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex, the world's fourth biggest hydropower dam, includes a main dam called Pimental and the Belo Monte reservoir.Harnessing the waters of the Xingu, the dam generated about 5% of all of Brazil's electricity last year, according to its operator Norte Energia.But the huge dam complex, vigorously opposed by many indigenous groups in the Amazon, is also changing age-old patterns of seasonally rising and falling water downstream, disrupting the balance of nature and the lives of people who depend on it, scientists and residents warn.""I feel sad because before I could earn my living, my family's living, by fishing,"" said Pedro Viana, 51, as he sat on the prow of a boat, trailing a fishing net in the abrupt turn in the Xingu known as the Volta Grande, or ""Big Bend"", a 130-km (80-mile) stretch of river downstream from the Belo Monte.""Nowadays, I have to survive by selling farina (manioc flour) and bananas,"" said Viana, a member of the local Juruna indigenous community.Researchers and indigenous advocacy groups say the Belo Monte complex's main Pimental dam blocks about 80% of the Xingu's water, sending it through an artificial channel that feeds the power station.Currently, the dam sends a maximum of 4,000 or 8,000 cubic meters of water downstream per second in the wet season - the amount alternates each year - and 700 cubic meters in the dry season, according to Norte Energia.But locals and researchers say that is a fraction of historical water release levels. That has prompted Brazil's environmental agency Ibama to ask for new studies into the impacts of the dam's water release levels.A May 2022 report by researchers from the United States and Brazil, partly funded by Norte Energia, found a nearly 30% reduction in fish species' ""richness, abundance, and functional diversity"" and an overall drop in fish sizes in the Volta Grande as a result of the Belo Monte complex's construction.Norte Energia has come up with proposals to adjust the amount of water it releases each season, to be considered by the federal prosecutor's office, which in the past has filed several lawsuits against the company for environmental damage caused by the construction of the dam.In a statement, Norte Energia said the amounts of water allocated below the Pimental dam were intended to ""ensure the ecological conditions of the Big Bend"" and create flows that ""simulate the natural pulse of the Xingu River.""In particular, the periods of lowest water release were not below naturally occurring levels in some years, it said.But Andre Oliveira Sawakuchi, an associate professor at the University of Sao Paulo's Institute of Geosciences and an expert who has studied the area for more than a decade, disagrees.The Volta Grande's colossal water discharge and granite rock base had created, over time, an ecosystem of forested islands in the river which have adapted to the seasonal ebb and flow of the river, Oliveira Sawakuchi said.""Here, we have a forest inside the river. This is very particular and unique,"" he said.But the dam's engineering has caused a ""total disruption of this ecosystem. It's not possible to keep both things working completely - energy production and the ecosystem,"" he added. The Juruna people have joined with scientists and the Brazilian nonprofit Socioenvironmental Institute, or ISA, to propose an alternate plan for water releases from the Pimental dam that would provide more water for themselves and nature.Their counter-proposal is expected to be considered by the federal prosecutor next month, alongside the company's.Around the Volta Grande there are already high-water marks exposed on boulders, wide sand dunes along the shores and new islands in the stream - all land that had been previously underwater.The Juruna - who call themselves the ""people of the river"" - say the changes are worrying for communities that have since time immemorial depended on the river for navigation, fish, and water for drinking, cooking and bathing.For the Juruna, a confluence of low waterfalls and rapids called Jericoa in the Volta Grande is a sacred place. Whitewater cascades create swirling eddies in the river, which they navigate with ease in wooden canoes or skiffs.Wearing a traditional headdress of blue and red macaw feathers ringed with white plumes, Giliarde Juruna, 40, chief of Mïratu village, rued the threats facing his people.He said former Juruna leaders had been tricked by Norte Energia into accepting environmental and financial pledges that the company failed to live up to.""They promised us we would have energy for free,"" he said. But at about 500 real a month per household, the electricity generated by the dam costs more than most in the community can afford, he complained.In a statement, the company said it had carried out ""more than 100 socio-environmental projects"" in the Volta Grande since 2011, complying with an agreement with Ibama.These include installing fish farms and cocoa plantations and bringing potable water access, sanitation and sewage systems to riverside communities, as well as providing healthcare access to families in the ""dam's area of influence"".Local people say those changes do little to benefit them.In Miratu, Josiel Pereira pointed to dead fish floating in one of the fish farms. He said the fish were an introduced species that were not well adapted to the area, unlike the once-abundant native species like pacu. Without enough fish in the Xingu, Silvia Da Cruiz, an indigenous mother of four in Miratu, said she has to buy meat, chicken and processed foods to feed her family, raising the cost of living and forcing families like hers into the cash economy.""It's not true that Belo Monte dam's energy is clean,"" said Mariel Nakane, an economist working with ISA. ""(Brazilians) are paying less for the hydroelectric power energy… but the costs are here on the people who live in the Volta Grande.""Originally published on: https://www.context.news/nature/brazils-people-of-the-river-pay-price-fo..."
/sports/cricket/news/malan-hits-82-england-beat-australia-eight-runs-3140981,Malan hits 82 as England beat Australia by eight runs,"Dawid Malan's 82 and disciplined bowling from England helped the visitors win the second Twenty20 international against Australia by eight runs Wednesday to seal the series and give them a confidence boost heading into the World Cup.Malan shared a crucial 92-run stand in Canberra with Moeen Ali (44) as England compiled 178-7 against a full-strength Australian attack.Despite Mitchell Marsh hitting 45 off 29 balls and Tim David 40 off 23, the hosts fell short.Sam Curran took 3-25 to ensure England won the three-match series 2-0 with a game left on Friday in a setback to the World Cup champions.""Really satisfying win after losing the toss as well and setting a target,"" said England skipper Jos Buttler.""I think we showed great character and Malan played fantastically well to anchor the innings.""Malan hit seven fours and four sixes in his 49-ball knock to rescue the visitors after they slumped to 54-4 in the ninth over.Ali was also impressive after Australian captain Aaron Finch won the toss and chose to bowl, making five changes to the side that also lost by eight runs in Perth.Pace spearheads Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, along with spinner Adam Zampa all returned for the hosts after being rested for the first T20.Buttler fell to Cummins on 17, with Zampa holding a difficult high catch.Alex Hales, who blasted 84 from 51 balls in Perth, lasted just seven balls for his four runs before holing out to David Warner off Marcus Stoinis.Star allrounder Ben Stokes' ordinary recent form continued, bowled by Zampa for seven, and when Harry Brook got an edge off Stoinis they were on the back foot at 54-4.But Malan was rock-solid, expertly finding the gaps to reach his 14th half-century.Zampa finally broke the partnership, tempting Ali into another big hit and he was caught on the ropes before a late flurry from Malan, who was out in the last over.""We were really poor in the field, sloppy, dropped a couple of chances, especially when we had them four down in the first 10 overs,"" said Finch.England rested pacemen Mark Wood and Chris Woakes but they still found a way to restrict Australia.Finch dropped down the order in recent matches, but returned to partner Warner for the first time since their Sri Lanka tour in the middle of the year.But he never settled and again fell cheaply, out for 13.Warner, who has been in form, followed three balls later for four to leave Australia struggling at 22-2 in the fifth over.Glenn Maxwell's recent poor form continued, out for eight, before Marsh and Marcus Stoinis put on a quick-fire 40-run partnership to keep them in contention.Stoinis went for 22, followed by Marsh, with Australia's fate resting with David and Matthew Wade. They needed 59 of the last five overs but were unable to deliver the fireworks required.

/shout/news/should-rickshaws-be-restricted-main-roads-3141096,Should rickshaws be restricted on main roads?,"In 2019, the city corporations made the decision to ban rickshaws from three major roads in Dhaka. The reason? To manage and reduce traffic congestion. Here we are, three years later, and the traffic has not yet improved. In fact, it has taken a drastic turn for the worse in recent times. It is easy to see where the government got the idea of banning rickshaws. The roads of this city are not wide enough to have space for separate lanes for different kinds of vehicles. As a result, the thoroughfares almost always witness traffic filled with a mixture of cars, buses, rickshaws, cycles, CNGs, etc.While motorised vehicles are more or less able to match in speed and performance, rickshaws, being man-driven, are slower. Vehicles of different capacities being on the same roads like this can be seen as a hindrance to traffic flow. It might even be accused of being a cause of the breakdown of traffic discipline, and the overall haphazard and dangerous driving habits that we see on the roads. However, what other option is there? The reason why rickshaws are so popular and occupy the roads to such a degree is that they are the best transport method for a large majority. The public transport system in our country is unreliable at best and for many, CNGs are only affordable if one has to make a long commute. Not only that, the deplorable conditions of the sidewalks make Dhaka an unwalkable city.In truth, banning rickshaws or even restricting them to alleyways is not a feasible option at all. Most of these alleys are uncomfortably narrow and barely allow a file of rickshaws to pass through without becoming blocked. They are battered as a result of poor planning and rough use, and there is hardly any proper repair done to them. It is cruel to ask rickshaw-pullers to drive only through these alleys.Furthermore, taking the convoluted routes through alleyways will most likely consume more of the rickshaw-pullers' time for each trip. However, since the destination is the same, their pay will continue to be the same as well. This will result in a disproportionate income for their labour. Many commuters will also probably face difficulties and opt for other methods of transport, once again impacting the livelihood of the rickshaw-pullers.During the Covid-19 pandemic, the income of these rickshaw-pullers plummeted drastically as a result of the decreased number of passengers and many had to rely on loans to make ends meet, particularly since no relief was offered to them. Moreover, the pandemic resulted in the loss of jobs in both rural and urban areas. Many of the people who lost these jobs are now taking up the job of pulling rickshaws in Dhaka. This in turn has led to further oversaturation in an already saturated market, thus, it is harder than ever for rickshaw-pullers to make a proper livelihood.From our privileged position, it is easy to opine on what should and should not be done. However, the people who are driving these rickshaws are in a different socioeconomic situation than us. Most of them cannot afford to entertain any ideas of such restrictions. Thus, unless a proper alternative mode of income can be found for these people and an alternative method of transport for commuters, restrictions simply cannot be imposed on rickshaws.Zaima is a struggling student, a failed guitarist and a poet in need of better poetic ideas.

/life-living/travel/news/your-complete-guide-visiting-the-sundarbans-3140886,Your complete guide to visiting the Sundarbans ,"The Sundarbans is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places in Bangladesh, and easily one of the best tourist attractions in the country. This mangrove forest is the largest in the world, and is densely populated with various trees, and diverse wildlife. This time of the year — from October to March —is best to visit this treasure trove of natural beauty as the weather is perfect, not too warm with low chances of rain or storm. But how do we get there and what's there to see? This article shall serve as your guide.       Here are the top 5 places to visit in the Sundarbans.Located in the southeast corner of the Sundarbans, this clean, beautiful, and serene beach is often interrupted by tiger roars. The sandy beach is spotted with red crabs and the area contains three tiger hills. It is also a great base for safaris, and bird-watching. If you are lucky, you may even spot a Royal Bengal Tiger! Apart from these, from a historical aspect, remnants of salt cultivation from the British period can still be found here.Hiron Point is the prime spot from where the diverse wildlife of the Sundarbans can be explored. It is a protected sanctuary for wildlife, and visitors can take a walk through the long wooden walkway to explore the various species of monkeys, deer, and reptiles. There is also a rest house near Hiron Point, the Neelkomol.  Kachikhali will give you a scope to absorb the raw natural beauty of the Sundarbans and feel the essence of the wildlife sanctuary located there. It is situated 14km east of Kotka and features a dense forest facing the Bay of Bengal. It is populated with numerous marine and land creatures that one can see. Kachikhali is also known as Tiger Point and has a rest house.   Karamjal is another place that is known for its dense population of wildlife. It is a popular tourist spot where people come to see the various species of wildlife roaming about the Sundarbans. This place is also used as the Deer Breeding Centre and Wildlife Reserving Centre. You can take a look at the diverse wildlife including dolphins, crocodiles, deer, wild boars, ducks, monkeys, and the majestic tigers.   Dublar Chor is a highly popular island in the Sundarbans, owing to its various types of fish, festivities, and breath-taking sunsets. Almost half of the year, this island remains submerged underwater. During the third week of November, under the full moon, the Hindu community observes their holy festival, Rash Mela, and devotees from all over the country come to join. However, this holy occasion is no longer open for tourists. How to go?
It is not practicable to go to the Sundarbans directly from Dhaka, although there were a few ships that used to take this route in the past, but now they are mostly halted or irregular. Moreover, choosing this method of travelling would stretch your trip to 5-6 days on a ship.
The easiest and most practiced method is to take a bus to Khulna or Mongla and then your trip provider will set you up on a ship. Although Khulna has better facilities in many ways, the completion of The Padma Bridge has made Mongla a popular docking point as well.
Alternatively, you can travel to Jessore by plane and then take a one-hour bus ride to Khulna. Most tour operators provide a 2-3 days tour and then drop guests back at the spot where they were received from. Furthermore, to visit the Sundarbans, a forest permit is required.     
Things to know
While visiting a forest, there are a few things you ought to keep in mind. Firstly, your attire must be light and simple, and bright colours should be avoided at any cost as they attract wildlife. Furthermore, perfumes cannot be worn.
Silence must be maintained at all times and people should walk in a straight line and stay together. Most importantly, visitors must have sharp eyes and stay vigilant all the time as many unprecedented mishaps can occur. Taking a dip in the water is prohibited and so is roaming about without the supervision of forest guards.

/sports/cricket/news/we-were-always-behind-the-game-shakib-3140736,We were always behind in the game: Shakib,"Bangladesh Test and T20I skipper Shakib Al Hasan admitted that the Tigers were always behind in their chase of a steep target against New Zealand in their T20I tri-nation series encounter in Christchurch on Wednesday. Chasing a mammoth 209-run target, Bangladesh were restricted to 160 for seven despite a fifty from skipper Shakib.""New Zealand put on a very good total and we were always behind in the game. But we should have scored maybe 15-20 more runs to close down the gap more as that would have been ideal,"" Shakib said at the post-match presentation following their 48-run loss to New Zealand that saw the Tigers crash out of the Tri-nation series. Shakib pointed out the area the Tigers have been struggling in recently.  ""We kept on losing wickets in the middle and that cost us the game. If you look at our last three games, it has been the same pattern. After 10 overs, we have been losing wickets consistently. We lose wickets every two overs and that is not helping us in getting the momentum and we are left forcing to build innings,"" Shakib added. Bangladesh got off to a promising start on a sporting wicket at the Hagley Oval today. The Tigers, despite losing both their openers, scored 52 in the Powerplay -- the most they have scored in the first six overs in the series. But the Tigers lost way in the middle. Bangladesh were 90 for two approaching the halfway stage of the game. From there, the Tigers lost wickets in a cluster and were reduced to five for 120 in 14.2 overs. Shakib fought valiantly but his 44-ball 70 did not amount to much as no other batter could capitalise on their starts. Bangladesh have one more game to play -- against Pakistan tomorrow -- in the series. And Shakib hoped to end the series on a positive note ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia later this month.  
 
""We are not that far [from forming a settled playing eleven], we have a few areas we need to fix. Actually, we do not have many options to be honest. We know what exactly the World Cup team is, we were just trying to give some guys a game to understand the best combination for the World Cup. We'll approach tomorrow to try and win the game. That's why it is an important game tomorrow,"" Shakib said.

/news/bangladesh/accidents-fires/news/7-missing-fishing-trawler-capsizes-karnaphuli-3141036,7 missing as fishing trawler capsizes in Karnaphuli,"At least seven persons were missing after a fishing trawler capsized in Karnaphuli River early (October 12, 2022) today.The incident occurred when the trawler FV Magferat was trying to dock at a dockyard named Sea Resource at the Ichanagar area on the southern bank of the river around 1:30am, reports our Chattogram staff correspondent reports quoting Ekram Ullah, officer-in-charge of Sadarghat River Police Station.There were 21 persons including 15 crewmen on board at the time, said the OC adding that the trawler owned by Rancon Oceania Limited, a concern of Rangs Group, was trying to get on the dockyard, owned by the same company.The missing persons were identified as captain of the trawler Faruk Bin Abdullah, second officer Md Jahirul Islam, chief officer Md Saiful Islam, greaser Pradip Chowdhury, fish master Md Jahir Uddin, staff of the dockyard Rahmat and father of one of the crewmembers whose name could not be known.Divers of the Fire Service and Civil Defence were sent to the spot for rescue operation but they faced difficulty due to the strong current in the river.Quoting witnesses, Mercantile Marine Department (MMD) Principal Officer Captain Md Giashuddin Ahmed who visited the spot told The Daily Star that the trawler at first got stuck and its engine stopped when it was trying to get on the dockyard.When the captain restarted the engine while trying to go back, he lost control and got hit by the floating buoy and turned to one side and capsized, he said.The trawler was built in 1992, he informed.MMD formed a three-member committee led by MMD Engineer and Surveyor Rafiqul Alam to probe into the incident and was asked to submit its report in 10 days, he added."
/sports/cricket/news/shakibs-70-vain-tigers-lose-against-nz-3140696,Shakib’s 70 in vain as Tigers lose against NZ,"Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan scored a fifty but a 200-plus target still proved to be too much for the Tigers as they suffered a 48-run defeat against hosts New Zealand in the T20I Tri-nation series at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Wednesday. The defeat also saw Bangladesh crash out of the T20I tri-nation series with three losses on the trot as New Zealand and Pakistan make it to the final, scheduled to be held at the same venue on Friday. Unlike the other two matches that Tigers lost in this series, Bangladesh batters were able to show intent in their chase of a 209-run target today. Shakib, in particular, looked to be in good touch during his 44-ball 70.However, despite Shakib's knock, Bangladesh were restricted to 160 for seven as they lacked the firepower at the death that is required to get over the line while in chase of such a big target.  The Tigers' team management faced backlash for having Shakib come down at number seven in their previous game in the series against New Zealand, which the Tigers lost by eight wickets. Coming at number four today, Shakib looked to be bold and innovative throughout his innings. The left-hander made his intentions clear right from the word go as he got off the mark by charging down the ground to hit Michael Bracewell for a boundary off the very first ball he faced. He hit a total of eight boundaries and one maximum and also starred in a 43-run stand with Soumya Sarkar, who scored 17-ball 23 in his first game for Bangladesh in over 11 months. Chasing a huge total, Bangladesh managed to get a positive start. Liton Das looked good during his 16-ball 23 as the Tigers amassed 52 for two wickets in the Powerplay. Shakib tried to keep the Tigers in the game but Bangladesh failed to match the tempo as the required rate skyrocketed over 18 an over at one point of the game. For New Zealand, pacer Adam Milne led the attack as he finished with figures of three for 24 in four overs. Earlier, a 40-ball 64 from Devon Conway and another rapid 24-ball 60 from Glenn Phillips helped New Zealand post 208 for five -- only the fifth time that a score above 200 was set at this venue.

/business/news/eu-countries-seek-way-out-impasse-over-gas-price-caps-3140761,EU countries seek way out of impasse over gas price caps,"The question of how, when and whether to cap gas prices is set to dominate another meeting of European Union countries on Wednesday, as they pursue a joint plan to target high gas prices - a compromise that has eluded them for weeks.The 27-country EU is plotting its next move to tame soaring energy prices and shield consumers from surging bills, as Europe heads into a winter of scarce Russian gas, a cost of living crisis and the looming threat of recession.""We need to find a quick solution that will be applicable to all the European Union,"" a senior EU official said. ""National solutions are not a way forward.""EU energy ministers meet in Prague on Wednesday to attempt to provide clearer instructions on what the European Commission should propose as the bloc's next emergency energy measure.But countries still cannot decide what they want.With gas prices almost 90% higher than a year ago, most EU countries say they want a gas price cap, but disagree on its design. Some countries, including Germany, Europe's biggest gas market, remain opposed.Talks among EU leaders last week did little to clarify the next steps. Those discussions ""went in all directions"", one EU diplomat said - referring to the numerous options being floated, including a price cap on all gas, pipeline gas, or just gas used to produce electricity.Another EU diplomat said no ""unified signal"" had come out of the leaders' talks. ""I'd say expectations are low,"" the diplomat said of Wednesday's meeting.Others were more hopeful a consensus was emerging. The senior EU official said countries were leaning towards the ""Iberian model"" of capping the price of gas used for power generation as a quick fix.Spain and Portugal implemented that scheme in June, which helped curb local power prices. The idea has gained support among other countries, although some worry it could raise EU gas demand, since Spain's gas use increased under the measure.EU countries have already rushed through emergency energy windfall profit levies, gas storage filling obligations, and electricity demand curbs to address the surge in energy prices driven by Russia slashing gas supplies since it invaded Ukraine.But the pressure to agree more EU-wide measures has increased after Germany said it would spend up to 200 billion euros to shield its consumers and businesses from high energy costs - prompting a backlash from some countries about the uneven rollout of national support."

/opinion/views/news/who-benefits-the-raids-healthcare-facilities-3141081,Who benefits from the raids at healthcare facilities?,"Every year, we see raids taking place at hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centres, and other healthcare facilities across Bangladesh. This year, too, the government ran a countrywide campaign against illegal healthcare facilities, shutting down more than 1,600 such institutions. No one can say how many unregistered hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centres and blood banks exist in the country. According to some estimates, the number of illegal hospitals is two or three times that of the legal ones.Healthcare providers cannot operate in secret, so how is it that so many unauthorised institutions have been able to run their activities? The more important question is: why are more and more people going to private institutions for healthcare?Over the years, budget allocations for the health sector as a proportion of the GDP have steadily declined in Bangladesh, which is now below one percent. Bangladesh is ranked the lowest in South Asia in terms of per capita government expenditure on healthcare. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), 49 percent of the country's population do not receive quality healthcare services. In 2020, the health sector was running with less than 10 doctors, nurses, and midwives for every 10,000 people. And the skills of the majority of doctors, nurses, and midwives in the country do not meet the standards set by WHO.Most of the hospitals that have been declared illegal by the government were occupied by doctors who are registered with Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC). Assistants at operation theatres (OTs) perform minor to major surgeries. There are not enough nurses; in many places, cleaners work as nurses. Smoke from the kitchen enters OTs at times, and used equipment is used to treat patients. Hospitals have been found to accommodate patients far beyond their capacity. Quality of lab work is substandard, and not all facilities are available to run tests. In many places, the environment is not good for patients at all.The raids that have shut down numerous unregistered hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres frequently seem to be for show now – one day they are closed, and the next day they are up and running again. The health administration has consistently failed to stop the massive level of corruption and irregularities that go on in these healthcare facilities, as an overwhelming majority of owners of illegal hospitals are politically influential.Illegal and unlicensed hospitals are mainly broker-dependent. In other words, agents of these hospitals roam around in the government hospitals, which are overburdened and have limited resources, and lure patients and their families – especially those who come from rural areas to seek medical treatment – to these private practices. In these hospitals, patients are often subjected to maltreatment, and the expenses are also very high. Many patients and their families lose everything to pay for their medical bills. These brokers roam around openly and are known. Yet, no action is taken against them.Owners of illegal clinics and diagnostic centres are also quite well-connected – both financially and politically. Therefore, oftentimes, if a patient dies due to improper treatment in any of these clinics, not much is said and done about it. That is why the raids to identify and fine illegal practices do not bring any significant change in the country's healthcare system. Unless the core problems are addressed, they never will.Healthcare has turned into a lucrative business for many people in the country, who do not deviate from their mission to make profits even in the most extreme situations. We have all seen how some people made hundreds of thousands of taka just by selling masks and testing kits in the early days of Covid-19 pandemic, when there was a severe crisis. Measly budgetary allocations for the health sector have not helped the situation either. Lack of priority on the government's part to make healthcare accessible to everyone is leaving a major segment of our population vulnerable to these profiteers. The only way to save our health sector from them and make quality healthcare accessible and affordable for the general mass is to bring the entire healthcare system of the country under the public sector. Regulations have to be in place and implemented in order bring semblance of accountability to the healthcare sector. Conducting some raids against private hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres from time to time will not make much difference.Dr Rakib Al Hasan is a physician, author, activist, and youth leader.

/tech-startup/news/mars-very-likely-hosted-alien-life-the-past-study-suggests-3140771,"Mars 'very likely' hosted alien life in the past, study suggests","According to a recent study, ""methanogens""—a class of organisms—likely lived in underground lairs on Mars billions of years ago and may still do so today.The study offers a tantalising glimpse of how microbial aliens could have emerged and survived on the red planet and concludes that Mars was ""very likely"" habitable to life more than 3.7 billion years ago and may still be home to hardy organisms today.Mars, today, is cold and dry. But there is a wealth of evidence to suggest that this world was once warmer, wetter, and more hospitable to life. In order to look for signs of extinct aliens that may have lived there billions of years ago, NASA's Perseverance rover is currently exploring the dried-out remnants of what was once a vast ancient lakebed on Mars, known as Jezero Crater.A team of researchers led by Boris Sauterey, a biologist at the Institut de Biologie de l'École Normale Supérieure in France, has published a groundbreaking study that evaluates the possibility of hydrogen-eating methanogens on early Mars and makes predictions about the future survival of any hypothetical descendants of these organisms.Even though there is no proof that life has ever existed on Mars, scientists have theorised that methanogens, which are among the oldest life forms on Earth, may have thrived in the planet's early environments. Methanogens produce methane as a waste product and get their energy from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, both of which were present on ancient Mars.The researchers also found that the early Martian microbes' activities would have caused a global cooling effect, possibly resulting in their own extinction. For billions of years, life has also changed the climate here on Earth, but these feedback loops have generally preserved and even improved the habitability of our planet. According to the new study, transient life may develop on many planets, but the kind of long-term habitability we have on Earth might be an exception."

/opinion/views/news/why-climate-needs-be-part-higher-education-3140976,Why climate needs to be a part of higher education,"In order to equip the future generations with the skills to deal with climate change, the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) has a target – Target 4.7 – that requires that, by 2030, all learners will acquire the knowledge and skills through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyle, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture's contribution to sustainable development. Indicators to check the progress of Target 4.7 are the extent to which global citizenship education and education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment. So, we have an excellent target and related indicators to measure the progress.However, what is the reality in the mainstream model of education? Since the 1972 Stockholm environmental conference, promotion of environmental education began to be mainstreamed into educational curricula, led globally by Unesco. Then came Chapter 36 of the Agenda 21 on Education, adopted at the Earth Summit in 1992, and finally SDG 4. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports call for action in striking a balance between lowering energy and resource intensity and promoting decarbonisation. But they overlook and underestimate the role of education in climate change, linking it narrowly to behavioural change through education and community approaches, including local and Indigenous knowledge. It is unsurprising that hardly any educator participated in writing the IPCC reports.However, this oversight reveals a much deeper issue, which is a de facto endorsement of business-as-usual in education, as a solution to environmental change. The assumption is that a wider access to quality education would automatically translate into higher environmental awareness and behavioural change, and most international development efforts have consistently prioritised Western education models that focus on economic growth and social equity over environmental issues. So, the education-related works of the World Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Unesco explicitly promote human capital theory, to realise the infinite growth paradigm. While their official statements align with SDG 4, they are targeted for promoting economic growth, as if there is no conflict between continued growth and environmental sustainability. Such angelisation of GDP growth is short-sighted, at the expense of limited environmental resources. This is evident from serious ecological crises all over the world.But sustainable growth – the physical expansion of economies – is an oxymoron, because the former cannot continue ad infinitum in a bounded global ecological system. This oversight is the reason that education and research on SDG 4.7 (sustainable lifestyles and global citizenship) remains a neglected area. Unesco's Institute of Statistics has focused its efforts on developing metrics for SDG 4.1- 4.6, while leaving SDG 4.7 unaddressed; this omission is evident in the SDG 4 Data Book: Global Education Indicators 2018. Any discussion on SDG 4.7 is almost always linked to improvements in individual cognitive skills, suggesting that SDG 4 goals can be achieved under the current education paradigm.But research by environmental psychologists shows that higher cognitive skills and knowledge do not necessarily prompt citizens into environment-friendly action. Rather, culture, including the concept of self (independent or interdependent self), affects how people are guided towards action. Western countries with dominant ""independent"" selfhood have higher carbon dioxide emissions and ecological footprints than in cultures with ""interdependent"" selfhood. Looking at the increasing disconnect between climate science and climate policies at international and national levels, it is clear that the Earth does not need mere ""educated"" consumers of knowledge; rather, it needs more ""environmentally-educated"" consumers.This reality calls for a fundamental reconceptualisation of education itself, along the line of famous American ecologist Aldo Leopold, that we need not just higher ""volume"" of education, but a change in its ""content."" This will bring into sharp relief, together with knowledge and skills (curriculum), access and equity (structure), a more fundamental revaluation of self and others (our being), i.e. culture and our relationship with ""nature."" We must fundamentally change the way we think of economic growth as the road to sustainable development, because the latter does not always require growth for improving the quality of life. While many developing countries still need environment-friendly growth for development, developed countries must focus on qualitative development, as they have achieved enough quantitative growth through mass and junk productions. So, understanding interactions, particularly negative loops, among different SDGs and different dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental – is instrumental in rethinking whether and under what conditions education can contribute to limiting climate change. This calls for a scathing critique of independent self-based Western model of education, with predominant focus on imparting knowledge and skills in numeracy. Do these skills fostering reflection over our ""being"" among students result in wisdom and self-realisation? Perhaps not.In the end, let me recall the wisdom of Spanish philosopher Ortega Gasset, who criticised the modern trend in university education of micro and macro specialisations, which create ""learned ignorants"" who lose sight of the forest for the trees and leaves. We must maintain a balance between breadth and depth in disciplines across university departments. At a minimum, we must set a goal of ecological literacy for all our students at the tertiary level. No student should graduate from universities without a comprehension of the basic principles of ecology and ecological economics, carrying capacity, energetics, end-use analysis, how to live a good life, limits of technology, appropriate scale, sustainable agriculture and forestry, steady-state economics, and environmental ethics. As Leopold very cogently asked, ""If education does not teach us these things, then what is education for?""Dr Mizan R Khan is deputy director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), and technical lead at the LDC Universities' Consortium on Climate Change (LUCCC)."

She is being held in solitary confinement in the capital, Naypyitaw, and her trials have been conducted in closed courts.The latest charges were related to allegations Suu Kyi accepted bribes from a businessman, said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.Suu Kyi received three-year jail sentences on two charges, to be served concurrently.Opponents of the military say the charges against Suu Kyi are aimed at blocking her from ever getting involved in politics again or trying to challenge the military's grip on power since last year's coup.A junta spokesperson did not answer calls seeking comment on Wednesday. The junta insists Myanmar's courts are independent and those arrested are receiving due process."
