/business/news/trading-govt-bonds-takes-place-3140106,Trading of govt bonds takes place,"The trading of treasury bonds and bills took place on the stock exchanges of Bangladesh today, a day after their debut.There are about 270 treasury bonds worth more than Tk 2.5 lakh crore with their tenures ranging from two years to 20 years, data from the Bangladesh Bank showed.Of them, 222 treasury bonds were listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) as of August, with a combined value of Tk 59,359 crore. But they were not traded like shares and mutual fund units and they could be bought and sold only over the counter.But it changed for the better on Monday as the BSEC allowed treasury bills and bonds to be traded like stocks and mutual fund units, albeit on a trial basis.No items, however, could change hands on the exchanges because of a technical glitch on the day. Data migration could not be completed on time so trading was not possible although there were some buy orders, said the DSE.But several treasury bonds were traded on the DSE and the Chittagong Stock Exchange yesterday.Thanks to the commencement of the trading of government securities, Bangladesh has taken a major leap forward by making them easily available to investors through the exchanges and diversifying the product base.However, the lot of the bonds is 1,000 with a face value of Tk 100 means investors need to pay at least Tk 1 lakh or above to buy a single set of securities. As a result, small investors did not show much interest in buying them.While stocks are ownership in a company, bonds are a loan to a company or government. Because they are a loan, with a set interest payment, a maturity date, and a face value that the borrower will repay, they tend to be far less volatile than stocks."

A judgment of 50-60 pages, every word has to be seen. It's taking some time for that.

/opinion/views/news/smartphone-addiction-children-how-are-parents-responsible-it-3139896,Smartphone addiction in children: How are parents responsible for it?,"Addiction to digital devices, particularly mobile phones, has been a grave concern in recent years. Everyone, from children to older people, cannot think of spending a moment without electronic gadgets – be it for playing games, watching movies, or scrolling through social media feeds. People nowadays are suffering from a condition called ""nomophobia,"" or the fear of being without one's cell phone.Recently, I returned home from work to find my whole family using their respective mobile phones while sitting on a bed together.After a while, I joined them. My sister spoke to me briefly, but we did not have any eye contact while talking. I believe this is the typical daily case for most of us. However, we rarely even think too much about it. Even those who care seem not to pay attention to these issues within their own lives. We often blame our children for being addicted to mobile phones, but what about us? What are we doing differently? It is up to adults to start spending less time looking at screens at home. When my nephew sees me reading books or writing something, though he cannot read or write, he still gets out a pen and paper for himself. He draws whatever he likes, but at least he does not use mobile devices. So, if we want our children not to use mobile phones excessively, we should stop doing it first. In most cases, parents' obsession with mobile phones affects children directly, causing secondhand obsession. Again, it may expose technology-based interruptions in parent-child interactions.It has been a common scenario that we first introduce mobile phones to our children, so they do not irritate us when we are otherwise engaged. We do so to distract them while they eat as well, to avoid any fussy behaviour. Hence, children become addicted to mobile phones. Essentially, we do not want to spend much time with our children, which results in addiction to mobile phones. However, while blaming our children for it, do we ever realise that we are responsible for it? The earlier we recognise our faults, the faster a solution will come about. According to a World Health Organization recommendation, a digital gadget, mobile phone, laptop, or phone should never be within the reach of a child younger than one-year-old. Children between ages two and five could use their phones for one hour daily. But, let alone following the guidelines of the WHO, it is more concerning how most of us don't even know about them. The research also found that most parents do not bother at all to halt the growing habit of their children of using smartphones. In many cases, they are happy to see their children's different abilities when using a smartphone. Most parents do not find anything wrong with this preoccupation with technology and social media and go on to ignore the harmful effects of too much screen time on their kids. So, before claiming that the situation is out of control and that children are bound to be addicted to mobile devices, we must consider what effective interventions we are taking to end this addiction. Md Sohrab Hossen is senior research assistant at Brac James P Grant School of Public Health, Brac University.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/3-movies-and-2-shows-watch-following-world-mental-health-day-3140181,3 movies and 2 shows to watch following World Mental Health Day,"Yesterday marked the occasion of World Mental Health Day. With growing awareness regarding the importance of mental health, it has become a key ingredient for the plotline of a variety of media.These stories not only help normalise such issues, but also act as brilliant sources of representation.So, with that in mind, here are five such shows and films that you can binge, following World Mental Health Day.Atypical
""Atypical"" is a Netflix original series about an 18-year-old American high school student, who has been diagnosed on the autism spectrum—a neurodevelopmental disease characterised by confined, repetitive behaviours and social communication problems.The show takes us through the life of Sam, brilliantly capturing the diversity of the autism spectrum. While it addresses heavier themes like grief and interpersonal conflict, it blends all these themes within lighter layers of honesty, humour, and warmth.The show not only focuses on Sam as an individual, but also his family members and loved ones as the plot leaves behind subtle questions regarding what is actually considered normal.Normal People
""Normal People"" covers several important themes, including grief, loneliness, and mental health. It has been critically acclaimed for its realistic depiction of men's mental health difficulties, something which is usually not discussed in mainstream media.While general loneliness pervades the series, the last few episodes highlight the challenges of living with mental issues. It does not undermine or exaggerate the conditions, and while it moves away from the narrative that a depressed person is supposed to stay isolated, it hints at the finer elements like the lack of energy to carry out every day mundane tasks.All the Bright Places
This show is a popular young-adult film, which explores the lives of two teenagers struggling with their individual, yet complex, issues. While Violet suffers from depression rooting from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Finch is haunted with an unnamed mental illness that has symptoms similar to bipolar disorder.Although the film does not explicitly address mental illness, it skilfully depicts how solitary, tiring and tough it can be to live with any form of mental health issue. ""All the Bright Places"" also emphasises the importance of discussing mental health, and carrying out important conversations before it's too late.The Perks of being a Wallflower
Directed by Stephen Chbosky, the plot of this film revolves around Charlie, a high school student who is haunted by past traumas, following the suicide of his friend.As the story continues, tales of childhood abuse are unveiled and he finds it extremely difficult to move on. ""The Perks of being a Wallflower"" presents a rather relatable story, with the familiar element of bottling up of emotions. The film received a lot of love from the audience, due to the strength displayed by the protagonist and the use of literature throughout the healing process.  Silver Linings Playbook
This popular film follows a person diagnosed with bipolar disorder, as he seeks treatment and recovers from an event caused by a manic episode. The main character's reluctance to acknowledge his mistakes adds to the truth of his diagnosis and the overall portrayal of his character.
At its core, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a love story, that also illustrates the smaller and more everyday ways in which mental health may affect a person's life. What makes this film critically acclaimed is the honest character development, coupled with truthful depictions of the disorder.

We don't listen to our brains, but become a victim of our hearts. We might be strong on the professional front, but we are soft as a marshmallow when it comes to our personal lives. It's extremely hard for women, especially if you are an artiste in the field of entertainment,"" wrote the actress.She went on to say that while one can see the red flags of men for themselves, and even their families point it out for them, they usually avoid believing the reality of things. ""You don't listen to them and just tell them that they don't know him as well as you do. They point out the evidence, they show you that he is a drug addict, but you make up tons of excuses to prove that it's not his fault.""""You know very well that he has mental health issues, that he suffers from bi-polar disease. Your mother and your sister warn you against him, but you tell them that not all men are the same and that you can fix him. However, pretty soon, he let's his anger loose and then abuses you mentally and physically. He raises his hands against you, and then tries to reconcile through sweet words,"" the post continued.""I guess women are feeble and frail fools that easily believe the words of men.

/sports/football/news/mixed-feelings-about-cabrera-3140151,‘Mixed feelings’ about Cabrera,"Having met with the Bangladesh coach Javier Cabrera and technical director Paul Smalley following the recent performance of the national football team, the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is now searching a path to counter the inconsistent performance of the men in red and green, which especially becomes prominent during a tournament's latter stages.The charges of Cabrera last month played two FIFA friendly matches, where they beat Cambodia 1-0 but lost 3-1 against Nepal in the second match. In June, Bangladesh suffered defeats in all three matches of Asian Cup Qualifiers but they showed signs of improvement in the first two matches before getting crushed at the hands of Malaysia in the third match.""If you look back, the booters drew with Nepal in their fourth match of the SAFF Championship when they needed a victory to progress to the final. They also suffered defeat against hosts Sri Lanka in their last match of an invitational tournament in Colombo while needing just a draw to play the final,"" said the National Team's Committee chairman Kazi Nabil Ahmed at a press briefing following a meeting with Cabrera and Paul Smalley at the BFF House today.""Similarly, in June, the boys showed their improvements against Bahrain and Turkmenistan during the Asian Cup Qualifiers but suffered heavily against Malaysia in the third match. Apparently the booters can't do well in the third or fourth matches. Why? We have discussed the matter with the coach and technical director and we have to find out how to overcome this problem,"" Ahmed added.Under the guidance of Cabrera, Bangladesh won one and drew two out of eight matches in the last seven months since the 37-year-old Spaniard was appointed as the head coach.Although Cabrera and Smalley looked gloomy after the meeting, the national teams' committee neither expressed full satisfaction nor dissatisfaction over the Spanish coach.With nearly three months left for Cabrera's one-year contract to expire, and no international engagements in this period, the question has been raised regarding whether Cabrera's contract will be extended or not?""The contract extension with the coach is a different matter because today we reviewed the different things of the national teams, such as team's outcomes, preparation, performance on the ground during their matches of the FIFA window in June and September,"" said the national teams' committee chairman.""We will sit again after four weeks and in that time, we will take our decision [whether to extend the contract or not] because this matter is not an emergency one at the moment,"" he added.Asked how much the committee was satisfied with the performance of Cabrera, Nabil said, ""It is not a matter of satisfaction, it is an ongoing matter. We have both feelings of good and bad. We have to work accordingly for the betterment of the players and the country.""  "
/business/news/serious-debt-crisis-unfolding-across-developing-countries-undp-3140171,Serious debt crisis unfolding across developing countries – UNDP,"The United Nations' Development Programme (UNDP) joined on Tuesday the chorus of institutions and charities warning that a serious debt crisis is now taking hold in the poorest parts of the world.In a new report, the UNDP estimated that 54 countries, accounting for more than half of the world's poorest people, now needed immediate debt relief to avoid even more extreme poverty and give them a chance of dealing with climate change.""A serious debt crisis is unfolding across developing economies, and the likelihood of a worsening outlook is high,"" the report published on Tuesday said.The warning comes as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank hold meetings in Washington this week amid rising global recession worries and a crop of debt crises from Sri Lanka and Pakistan to Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia.Achim Steiner, UNDP administrator, urged a string of measures, including writing off debt, offering wider relief to greater numbers of countries and even adding special clauses to bond contracts to provide breathing space during crises.""It is urgent for us to step up and find ways in which we can deal with these issues before they become at least less manageable and perhaps unmanageable,"" he told reporters.Without effective debt restructuring, poverty will rise and desperately needed investments in climate adaptation and mitigation will not happen.The UNDP's report also called for a recalibration of the G20-led Common Framework - the plan designed to help countries pushed into financial trouble by COVID-19 pandemic restructure debt. Only Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia have used it so far.Its proposal was to expand the Common Framework's eligibility so that all heavily indebted countries could utilise it rather just the 70 or so poorest countries, and for any debt payments to be automatically suspended during the process.""Both will act as an incentive for creditors to participate and to maintain a reasonable timeline, and it could also remove some of the hesitancy caused by rating fears for debtor countries,"" the report said.It also recommended creditors should have a legal duty to cooperate ""in good faith"" in a Common Framework restructurings and that countries could offer to take eco-friendly measures to encourage creditors to write their down debt.""It makes a lot of sense,"" the report said. ""Not only have these countries contributed the least to, but bear the highest cost of, climate change""."
/opinion/views/news/time-higher-education-bangladesh-evolve-3139961,Time for higher education in Bangladesh to evolve,"Four years have passed since I moved to Bangladesh from the UK to serve as a registrar, first at Asian University for Women and then at Brac University. I loved Bangladesh from the moment of touchdown in Chattogram: a country and region of transcendent beauty, resourcefulness and sense of the vibration of life.Coming from the UK, it is natural to make comparisons between the Bangladesh and UK higher education systems. There is much to learn on both sides. One of the obvious comparisons is that it generally takes far less time for full-time students to graduate in the UK than Bangladesh – three years in most cases, although there are variations. Higher education in the UK, and more widely, in Europe has, of course, had much longer to become established, with a remarkably strong research base, well-developed links with industry, and good practice in effective, dynamic approaches to teaching, learning, and student support.Bangladesh has an opportunity, however, to avoid some of the mistakes that have occurred recently in UK higher education policy. There is presently a reductionist tendency in public policy in the UK, more particularly in England, to judge the value of higher education on the basis of short-term career outcomes and starting salaries for graduates.We want to work in partnership with our students, not to see them primarily as customers, but to encourage their appreciation of the value of higher education. That involves challenge, self-discipline and personal transformation. Students are invited to become good, thoughtful, socially responsible citizens committed to a life of sustained service to humanity. We must help students to learn, encouraging active rather than passive learning, critical thinking, hard and soft skills, resourcefulness, entrepreneurship, and avoiding overemphasis on examinations, which stifles learning.Bangladesh faces a curious challenge. There are high rates of graduate unemployment alongside evidence of the need for high-level graduate skills to meet the demands of a massive social and technological revolution. Many countries have invested heavily in higher education as their economies move from low wage manufacturing into diverse economies based on knowledge and high-level skills.There are often criticisms of higher education institutions: questions whether too many people enter university and whether they are studying the right subjects. There are debates about the actual impact of higher education on student learning. The extent of university investment in vocational education is considerable, however, and often underestimated by commentators. The contribution of higher education to the economy around the world is well-evidenced, coming from research, knowledge exchange, professional training, workforce development, innovation, and creativity.Each year, concerns are expressed through the national media about the relatively poor performance of Bangladeshi universities in world league tables. Really, Bangladesh just has not played the league table ""game""; with a few exceptions, universities have not systematically focused on the criteria that inform the league table results. League tables are a marketing device that give a distorted impression, and the comparisons between institutions are highly questionable. Yet league tables can also be a powerful stimulus for institutional improvement and visibility. There is an urgent need for substantial, nationwide improvement in higher education in Bangladesh. Some universities are engaged in significant development and there are various national initiatives, but the clock is ticking as international competition grows stronger and talented Bangladeshi graduates are disadvantaged against their contemporaries in other countries.Prof Vincent Chang, vice-chancellor of Brac University, has observed, ""Of particular concern is Bangladesh's failure to establish any globally ranked universities at the time when the country is trying to become a diversified knowledge-based economy. Higher education institutions are generally regarded as the enabling vehicles for the creation of knowledge-based industries because they ensure that future knowledge workers have the skills and competences to become globally competitive. The reason for this failure is largely down to a lack of investment in the higher education system. In the last half a century, East Asian economies have transitioned from low wage manufacturing economies into diversified knowledge-based economies. To achieve this, they have invested heavily in their higher education institutions and unashamedly imported international expertise and best practice methods…""Facing the profound social and technological change of a new industrial revolution, Bangladesh can reap considerable benefits through reform of higher education. There are various ingredients that are necessary to a thriving higher education sector. Many of those ingredients are included already in the national Bangladesh Strategic Plan for Higher Education 2018-2030.It can take years to develop new programmes of study even when they address urgent national, social, and economic needs. Meanwhile, some other countries race ahead without those constraints. There is an imperative for Bangladesh to introduce a more effective and timely approach to academic programme development before the country loses irreparably to international competitors.It does not have to be that way. The national quality assurance system should focus mainly on outputs rather than inputs. Some years ago, the UK Quality Assurance Agency created an institutional review which involves a periodic assessment of quality and standards in each institution, conducted through a physical visit by teams of trained peer reviewers. Within an outcome-based system of national accreditation in Bangladesh, institutions with demonstrably robust systems could be given greater freedom to pursue programme development and educational innovation.There appears to be a counterproductive tendency to see the public and private universities in a position of opposition to each other. There are persistent challenges for private universities to introduce new programmes, to try innovative approaches to teaching and learning and to bring industry into the classroom. We are in the strange situation where some private university faculties are able to supervise doctoral students in leading international universities, but not in their home country. The restriction on leading private universities awarding PhDs in subject areas where they have demonstrable and sustainable expertise is also a restriction on the growth of research for national benefit, of high quality postgraduate provision, and an increase in the numbers of highly qualified faculty across Bangladesh.There is much talk in higher education circles of the value of ""internationalisation."" ""Internationalisation"" is about the higher education sector valuing diversity and functioning in an intimately connected, borderless world, where ideas and knowledge are shared. The theme of internationalisation is in the tradition of Rabindranath Tagore, who supported a concept of global community and who called for ""unity in diversity,"" expressed in the ideas for his own schools and Visva-Bharati University.The development of international academic partnerships should be evaluated carefully as Bangladesh becomes more attractive to international providers. Bangladesh may lose through partnerships which just lead students away to study in other countries, maybe never to return, or which damage good local providers through unfair competition. There is a need for genuine, two-way international partnership, mutual learning and capacity-building for Bangladesh. Indeed, other countries and their higher education sectors have much to learn from Bangladesh, which has profound expertise from the experience of nation-building and social and economic development over half a century. Dr Dave Dowland is registrar of Brac University and former registrar and chief operating officer of Asian University for Women.

/news/asia/india/news/india-inflation-likely-hit-5-month-high-sept-surging-food-prices-3140196,India inflation likely hit 5-month high in Sept on surging food prices,"India's retail inflation accelerated to a five month high of 7.30% in September due to surging food prices, staying well above the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) upper tolerance band for a ninth month, a Reuters poll found.Fueled by erratic rainfall and supply shocks from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prices of daily consumables like cereals and vegetables which form the largest category in the inflation basket have climbed over the past two years.Already reeling from COVID-19 pandemic-induced economic shocks, India's poor and middle classes will be further hit by the increases as they spend a large chunk of income on food.The Oct. 3-7 Reuters poll of 47 economists suggested inflation - as measured by the Consumer Price Index (INCPIY=ECI) - rose to an annual 7.30% in September from 7.00% the previous month. If realised, that would be the highest since May 2022.Forecasts for the data, due at 1200 GMT on Oct. 12, ranged between 6.60% and 7.80%. Some 91% of economists, 43 of 47, expected inflation to be 7.00% or higher, suggesting the bias was for prices to go up further.""There is a strong pressure from food that is playing out,"" said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.The Indian government has introduced measures to calm local prices, including some export restrictions on rice to temper inflation. But consumer prices have remained defiant and stayed above the RBI's upper tolerance limit this year.A weakening currency is also not helping. The battered Indian rupee hit a new low of 82.32/$ on Friday and was expected to remain under pressure over the next six months, a separate Reuters poll of FX analysts showed.That is likely to pressure the RBI, which has raised its key repo rate by 190 basis points in four moves this year, to intensify its interest rates hikes.""Against a more hostile global backdrop and a stickier inflation trajectory at home, we now expect a terminal rate of 6.75% - previously 6.25% - in this cycle,"" said Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at J.P. Morgan.""To the extent the rupee weakens, there will be passthrough effects to the CPI trajectory."""
