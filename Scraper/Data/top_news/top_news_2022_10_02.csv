As a result, diesel consumption has not been reduced. Rather, it has increased.""""With all these challenges, the cost of doing business is increasing and the export from Bangladesh has been performing poorly since September."""
/business/economy/news/school-banking-gaining-traction-3132756,School banking gaining traction,"School banking is increasingly gaining popularity among students, exemplified by total deposits in such accounts surpassing Tk 2,300 crore in July despite ongoing economic hurdles such as rising inflation. Students deposited Tk 2,326 crore in the accounts as of July this year, up 7 per cent year-on-year, according to Bangladesh Bank.The number of accounts under school banking rose 13.6 per cent year-on-year to 31.89 lakh in July this year.A number of banks earlier took a set of measures to widen school banking operations as per instructions of Bangladesh Bank, which mainly gave a boost to financial inclusion among students, said a central bank official having substantial knowledge on the matter.The number of accounts and the outstanding balance under the school banking programme would have increased manifold had not the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing economic crises hit the economy, he said.The financial condition of a large number of parents of students is now critical due to the upward trend of inflation, which has already eroded their income base.Deposits in banks usually decline in the time of inflation, but the matter is different for school banking.In addition, educational institutions remained closed for a majority of 2020 and 2021 in attempts at weaking the pandemic, putting an adverse impact on the school banking operations.""Despite all the odds, it is a positive sign that both the outstanding deposits and the number of accounts under the school banking programme rose in recent times,"" the official said.The central bank introduced school banking in 2010 as a part of its efforts to widen financial inclusion and make students financially literate.The scheme aims to instil the habit of savings into students and make them more efficient in money management.So far, 55 banks have rolled out school banking operations, allowing students aged 11 years to 17 years to open accounts.The accounts come with a number of advantages, such as waivers on fees and charges, free internet banking, low minimum balance requirement and debit card availability at low costs.Accounts can be opened with a minimum deposit of Tk 100.Saiful Amin, head of branches of The City Bank, said they were laying more emphasis on widening the school banking operations in rural areas rather than in urban ones.""The City Bank is aiming at expanding the banking operation in order to create deposit habits among students and strengthen their knowledge about financial literacy,"" he said.""We are trying to speed up our financial inclusion programme by carrying out different initiatives including to widen our school banking operations,"" he said.The bank has already instructed all branches to give some emphasis on school banking like it does for others, Amin said.""We hope that the school banking operation of The City Bank will spread more in the days ahead,"" he said."

/sports/football/news/world-cup-stickers-are-quadrennial-craze-latin-america-3133366,World Cup stickers are a quadrennial craze in Latin America ,"Some spend crazy amounts, others line up at dawn or gather at informal swap meets -- anything to satisfy a passion that combines love of soccer, this year's World Cup in Qatar and the ever-popular pursuit of Panini soccer stickers.Sold in 150 countries, the stickers seem to arouse a particular frenzy in Latin America because of the possibility that this might be the last World Cup for Argentinian football icon Lionel Messi, who is 35, or that a Latin American side might finally break Europe's hold on the Cup.""Almost everything I earn, that anyone lends me, or that they owe me, I invest in the stickers,"" Hilda Losada, who is Argentinian, told AFP.The 68-year-old grandmother, who is working to complete her album of nearly 700 stickers -- and her grandson's as well -- has been waiting in line since 5:00 am for the opening of a store in Buenos Aires.The stickers have been in short supply for days in Argentina, with the government itself intervening to mediate between the Italian publisher and frustrated shopkeepers who want a bigger piece of the juicy trade.""This is one of the few places where you can find them now,"" Losada said, standing in a long line of collectors.Not everyone will leave happy, and some are vowing to turn to the black market, if need be, even if it costs twice the official price of about $1 for five stickers.Her family tells her she's crazy, but Losada pays them no mind as she happily pursues her fascination. She has been collecting the cards every four years since she was ""a little girl,"" she insists, even if galloping inflation in Argentina -- currently at 56 percent -- does not make that easy.""Argentina is nearly always in an economic crisis,"" shrugged the shop owner, Leila Edul. ""But now, with these stickers... money somehow appears out of nowhere.""That is true despite the soaring price of a packet since the 2018 World Cup in Russia. In Brazil, the cost has doubled, from 37 US cents to 74 cents.'We like to trade'""My father bought me three packets,"" said an exuberant Tiziano Orselli, 14, as the two inspected the offerings at a swap meet at Buenos Aires's Rivadavia Park.""When I saw 'Argentina 19' and realized it was Messi, I was too happy,"" he said. I showed it to everybody and then I stuck it, there, in the album,"" he said, his eyes still wide at the thought.Mauricio Valencia had set up a table on sawhorses and piled it high with stacks of stickers to trade or sell. He said he had done this previously in Colombia, because ""in Latin America we like to trade (Panini) stickers.""""But it's not the same here,"" he added. ""There is such fervor -- it's packed every weekend.""Raul Vallecillo, a Panini official in Chile, said Latin American sales have exceeded the expectations of the Italian manufacturer, which published its first album for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico.Chile's national team did not qualify for this year's World Cup, which opens in Qatar in November, yet Panini sold in a single month the stock it had expected to last four months, he said. The same trend holds in Venezuela, Colombia and Peru, all of which also failed to qualify, he said.Vallecillo said the infatuation with the cards is heightened by the likelihood that this will be the last appearance of aging superstars like Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as well as the hope the Argentine or Brazilian side will be able to break the European teams' 20-year stranglehold on the championship.Street vendorsIn Sao Paulo, collectors have been gathering outside the Football Museum.Forty-year-old Leandro Fonseca is on the hunt for some special-edition stickers, including some with Neymar's image, which have been selling on the internet for hundreds of dollars.""I'm off to a late start on the 'extras,' but I hope to fill 20 albums, he said. ""I fill several during every World Cup.""He said he had spent around $1,800 so far to complete seven albums.Across Latin America, the resale business is brisk.On a busy road in Montevideo, children come, carrying lists of sticker numbers, to try to buy those they're missing.The stickers of stars like Messi, Neymar and local favorite Luis Suarez sell for around 100 pesos ($2.40). Other lesser stars from the Uruguayan, Argentine or Brazilian sides go for 20 to 50 pesos, while still others go for just 10 pesos (though a star like France's Kylian Mbappe brings in 50 pesos).Guillermo Orcile has been helping his seven-year-old son Salvador complete his album entirely through trades.""It's important that he understand how trading works, which makes these albums important,"" he said.""Because if it's just about buying, then the spirit is lost."""

He along with his gang members have sedated and robbed around 300 people, mostly expatriate, in last 15 years,"" Khandaker Al Moin, Rab's Legal and Media wing director told a press conference today.Using the similar tricks, Amir on September 2 robbed the luggage, carrying valuables including eight bhoris of gold ornaments, of a Bangladeshi expatriate in Kuwait on their way to Bogura, Moin said.  Moin said this gang, having at least 10 members, are active in Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport for years. They mainly target those expats for whom only one relative come to the airport to take them home.The Rab director said Amir was arrested twice—January and April—for same offence but re-engaged in the crime, coming out of jail on bail. He was accused in at least 15 cases.  Milton is a microbus driver and started working as the close aid of Amir for the last three to four years. Parvez, a jewellery shop owner, used to buy the gold robbed from the expatriates, Rab officials said.During the drives, Rab recovered five bhoris of gold and sedative-mixed biscuits from their possession. "

/news/asia/south-asia/news/arrest-warrant-issued-against-imran-khan-over-threatening-sessions-judge-3133201,Imran Khan gets pre-arrest bail in case over remarks against judge,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Sunday approved the pre-arrest bail of PTI chief Imran Khan, a day after an arrest warrant was issued for the former premier in connection with his controversial remarks against Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Zeba Chaudhry and other officials at an August 20 public rally.Imran's arrest warrant, dated September 30, was issued by Senior Civil Judge Rana Mujahid Rahim. As details of the warrant emerged, PTI workers and leaders converged on Banigala to scuttle any attempts at his arrest, warning once again that he is a ""red line"".According to Islamabad police, after the Islamabad High Court struck down terror charges from the case registered against Imran, the case was transferred to a sessions court and the PTI chief had not obtained his bail from there.The police also said he had also not attended the last court hearing on the matter and the warrant was issued to ensure his presence.Subsequently, Imran filed a petition with the IHC on Sunday through his counsel Babar Awan.In the plea, Imran said that a terrorism case was initially filed against him, however, the charges were later struck down by the high court and the case was transferred.He alleged that the coalition government had filed a false case against him, the purpose of which was to quash the peaceful movement against the ""corruption mafia"".According to the plea, the purpose of the case was to arrest Imran in order to put an end to a ""peaceful political movement.Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani took up the PTI leader's petition and barred Islamabad police from arresting Imran. The court approved Imran's bail against the submission of surety bonds worth Rs10,000.The IHC also directed Imran to appear before the court concerned before Friday.Speaking to the media outside the court, Awan said the IHC had granted the PTI chief ""pre-arrest transitory protective bail"", adding ""we will turn up at the lower court before Oct 7.""Awan said he appeared before Justice Kayani and raised a few ""factual points"" pertaining to the case.""I told him that we had already obtained bail in this case as well as the fact these charges can't be imposed because they are non-cognisable offences,"" he said.The PTI chief's counsel said whatever happened yesterday evening was ""very dangerous"" as the whole country stood up without any call. ""This imported government must see Imran's power.""He was of the view that lawyers, peasants, labourers, students, youth as well as the whole of Pakistan would take to the streets once the party leader gave the date for his long march.He said it would now be the PTI's turn to file cases based on ""truth and facts"", adding the government won't be able to lodge cases anymore.CONTEMPT CASEThe decision to initiate contempt proceedings against Imran was taken by the IHC's Justice Aamer Farooq on August 22 while hearing a petition challenging Gill's police remand. The court had summoned Imran on August 31 and subsequently issued him a show-cause notice.A day before the hearing, the former prime minister had submitted a reply before the IHC wherein he had expressed his willingness to ""take back"" his words about Judge Chaudhry if they were ""regarded as inappropriate"". He had pleaded before the IHC that the judges who had agreed to initiate the case against him should consider withdrawing themselves from the bench as, according to him, they had pre-judged the matter.However, the IHC had deemed the response to be ""unsatisfactory"" and asked the PTI chief to submit a ""well-considered"" response.Following this, Imran had submitted another reply to the court. In the revised response, Imran had stopped short of rendering an unconditional apology.On September 8, the IHC had decided to indict Imran, once again calling his response ""unsatisfactory"".However, at the next hearing on September 22, when it was expected that charges would be framed against the PTI chief, Imran had offered to tender an apology to Judge Chaudhry and escaped the indictment.Following his statement in the court, the larger bench hearing the case had said that it was ""satisfied"" with the apology and asked the PTI chief to submit an affidavit.Prior to submitting the affidavit, Imran on Friday appeared before an Islamabad sessions court to personally apologise to Judge Chaudhry, but his apology was left hanging as the judge was on leave.Meanwhile, in his affidavit, Imran said he had ""realised during these (contempt) proceedings before the honourable court that he might have crossed a red line"". However, he added, he never intended to threaten Judge Chaudhry and ""there was no intention behind the statement to take any action other than legal action"".He said he wanted to assure the IHC that he was willing to explain and clarify before Judge Chaudhry that"" neither he nor his party seeks/sought any action"" against her and he was willing to apologise to her ""if she got an impression that the deponent (Imran) had crossed a line"".He also expressed his willingness to take any further steps that the IHC ""deems necessary and appropriate for the satisfaction of the honourable court that he never intended to interfere in the process of the court or impugn the dignity or independence of the judiciary"".Copyright: Dawn/Asia News Network"

/environment/climate-change/news/labour-productivity-hit-extreme-temperatures-dhaka-loses-6b-year-3133096,Extreme heat: $6b loss a year in Dhaka’s labour productivity,"Dhaka is losing $6 billion worth of labour productivity each year due to heat stress from extreme temperatures, said a study published yesterday.This amounts up to 8 percent of the annual labour output in Dhaka, said the study published by the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center, a joint initiative of The Rockefeller Foundation and philanthropist Adrienne Arsht.The study compared 12 cities across the globe and found that in Dhaka heat impairs labour productivity more than any other city.The other cities studied include New Delhi, Athens, Buenos Aires, Freetown, London, Los Angeles, Miami, Monterrey, Santiago and Sydney.The study titled ""Hot Cities, Chilled Economies: Impacts of Extreme Heat on Global Cities"" said unless measures were taken to reduce global warming, the loss will rise to 10 percent by 2050.This is the highest share of losses of any city in this study, it added. ""While others such as Abu Dhabi and Bangkok are more exposed to heat stress, Dhaka is unusually vulnerable to its effects, due to its labour-intensive economy and low rate of active cooling,"" said the report.""Despite the already high temperatures and humidity of between 60 and 80 percent in Dhaka, climate change is set to make things substantially worse.""Because of the unchecked warming, sectors such as manufacturing loses $1.5 billion while logistics loses $1.8 billion yearly.The report states that in Dhaka, for the 10 hottest days of a typical year, the apparent temperature (considering both heat and humidity) is hotter than the human body.In 2020, Dhaka experienced 36.5 days in which the 24-hour average temperature was more than 28.8 degree Celsius. By 2050, this could rise to 69.8 days.The surface of roads can currently reach up to 60 degree Celsius, found the report.""Large and widespread hotspots within the city are more than 10 degree Celsius higher than the surrounding countryside.""The heat impacts the poor disproportionately, said the report.""The highest worker productivity-related economic losses from the heat are felt by those least able to bear them. In sectors such as garment manufacturing, transport, and retail trade, where wages can be lower than average, losses already amount to around 10 percent of income.""Losses in manufacturing are likely to be particularly high in sectors such as garment manufacturing or brick making, where proximity to machinery or ovens increases the temperature to which workers are exposed, said the report.It said that heat is concentrated in some of the city's poorest areas.""In Kamrangirchar, an area containing a high concentration of informal settlements with widespread use of corrugated iron sheet roofing, temperatures are typically 12 degree Celsius higher than Dhaka's surroundings.""Such temperatures lead to health risks, it added.""The world is burning. Unfortunately, that's not an exaggeration. Climate-driven heat is changing the way we live and work,"" commented the report.Ashraf Dewan, a professor at School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Curtin University, Australia, had earlier studied urban heat islands and how the temperature of Dhaka has risen over the decades.""Urban heat islands are places whose temperature is hotter than the surrounding areas. In Dhaka, temperature is sporadically felt differently in different places,"" said Dewan.""The poorest areas are hotter because of lack of greenery and the use of corrugated iron sheets. These trap heat during the day, and do not radiate heat fast enough at night. Since these areas are surrounded by high-rise buildings that do not facilitate wind flow, the air gets trapped,"" he explained.""Water bodies used to cool down the city. But we don't have water bodies anymore. In addition, the reliance on air conditioners lead to heat being dispensed into the surrounding air.""Furthermore, glass buildings aggravate urban heat islands – they let in heat and light during the day but they need more air conditioners for cooling.""Professor Dewan said that the easiest and cost-effective solution is to plant more trees – they do not let the air temperature rise."

/opinion/views/news/kennans-1946-long-telegram-moscow-it-relevant-beijing-3133376,Kennan’s 1946 ‘Long Telegram’ from Moscow: Is it relevant for Beijing?,"On February 22, 1946, George Kennan, American chargé d'affaires in Moscow, sent an 8,000-word-long telegram to his State Department bosses. Later known as the ""Long Telegram"", it became the most influential foreign policy paper for dealing with the communist state. It helped articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets and became the basis of the US Cold War policy toward the Soviet Union. In 1947, Kennan wrote an article titled, ""The Sources of Soviet Conduct"", arguing that its regime was inherently expansionist and that its influence had to be ""contained"". It deeply influenced President Truman who adopted a ""containment policy"" to stop Soviet communism's expansion. Kennan argued for isolating the Soviet Union and waiting for it to fall under its own weight, which it eventually did in 1991.Meanwhile, in 1978, China launched its economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping. Riding on its economic success, Beijing bolstered its military muscle as well. Xi Jinping, after becoming China's president in 2012, undertook renewed measures to build an army to ""fight and win"" global wars. In 2013, he launched the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to build large infrastructures in Asia, Africa, Europe, and other regions.The rise of an assertive Beijing alarmed Washington. In 2015, President Barack Obama undertook a rebalancing of power toward Asia. Containing China became America's major policy issue. In December 2017, the US declared China's rise a military threat and launched the China containment policy by borrowing a page from Kennan's playbook.The policy extended to the tech sector as well. In 2012, an American congressional investigation concluded that the equipment of Huawei, a Chinese tech giant, could pose a threat to US interests. Accordingly, President Obama banned companies from using Huawei's products. Biden intensified the tech war by including semiconductors in it. Washington also persuaded its allies to adopt the same policy towards Beijing's tech initiatives, turning it into a global tech war. Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act in August to increase American hold on the semiconductor industry. He also launched the Chip 4 initiative involving Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, with an express aim of keeping China out of this crucial technology.The China containment policy has thus taken deep roots following Kennan's anti-Soviet postulations. But will what worked against the Soviets also apply to China? On the surface, there are some similarities between the two; both are under authoritarian regimes, and both are founded on the same communist idea. But there are some striking dissimilarities too.Kennan aptly noted that the Soviet leadership perceived itself at perpetual war with capitalism. The Soviets did not see the possibility of any peaceful coexistence with the capitalist world, and they persistently aimed at advancing the socialist cause. There was nothing in capitalism they could adopt. China, in sharp contrast, did see the benefits of a market economy and used it to its benefit. It opened up international trade and foreign investment and did everything required to take advantage of capitalism's strengths.Second, China has a long tradition of doing business with adversaries which its rich silk road history shows. As the ancient traders embarked on perilous journeys through the tribal territories in Central Asia, Chinese emperors didn't attempt to bring those territories under their total control. Instead, they made trade more attractive to the tribes than looting or war. The same game is being played today, as Beijing aggressively pushes ahead with its BRI projects. The 11,000 km long train route linking China's Chongqing with Germany's Duisburg, which opened in August 2012, is carrying tens of thousands of containers each year (currently, an alternative route is used bypassing Russia due to the Ukraine war).Third, China is intricately connected to the international trade and economic system, making it almost impossible to isolate it without harming the global economy. It became the world's largest exporter of goods in 2009, and the largest trading nation in 2013. In 2017, its share of global goods trade rose to 11.4 percent (from 1.9 percent in 2000). It is also the largest export destination for 33 countries and the largest source of imports for 65. It received the second largest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from 2015 to 2017. China was also the world's second-largest source of outbound FDI over the same period. In 2019, 1.2 million American jobs depended on exports to China of which 245,000 were lost after the start of the trade war. China accounts for a third of Germany's car sales. Almost 40 percent of Australian exports go to China. Beijing controls 90 percent of the supply of processed rare earth minerals that is essential for refining petroleum and making advanced weaponry, high-end electronics, electric vehicles, and wind turbines without which the modern economy will crumble.Unlike the Soviet Union, China is a peer of the US in economic might with increasing tech and military muscle. History has repeatedly shown that wars that were expected to be short and decisive ended up being long and protracted, severely draining both sides. Washington and Beijing know enough to realise that war is not a viable option, but coexistence is. Both sides need to consider the other's realities and reign in the proponents of a war that will be unimaginably disastrous. And finally, each has its history, domestic issues, and political conviction. Understanding that is one good step towards modus vivendi, or coexistence.Dr Sayeed Ahmed is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation."

/entertainment/music/news/evening-euphoria-e-sang-3133316,An evening of euphoria with E-Sang,"A concert hosted by the Embassy of the Republic of Korea, took place in the heart of Dhaka -- Hatirjheel Amphitheatre, on Saturday, 1st October 2022. Korean Band E-Sang, who won a Korean Folk Song Talent TV Show, blessed the Bangladeshi Kopp fans with their mesmerizing performance.The show was inaugurated with both countries' national anthem, followed by the opening speech by RTV's CEO, Syed Ashik Rahman, Director & CEO of Hyundai Bangladesh, Mutassim Daiaan, RTV's Chairman & MP, Morshed Alam.His Excellency, Lee Jang Keun, the Ambassador of Korea in Bangladesh, who greeted the audience with Bengali words and irresistible charm.Mayor of Dhaka North City Corporation, Atiqul Islam, welcomed the band E-Sang, while singing short verses of Bengali songs himself.E-Sang performed a line-up of songs, infused with theirenergetic charisma. Their original, ""Sarang-Ga"", which tells the narrative of a lady courtesan and a male high officer in the chosen dynasty, was breathtaking to listen to.Traditional Korean folk song ""Arirang"" depicted love in a mournful way, while ""Sa-Seol Nanbong-Ga"" celebrated it humorously. They also encouraged people to relax in the midst of their frantic everyday lives by performing the song, ""Urban Flute"".""The Dance in the Rhythm"" was initially performed by Kim Wan-sun, a Korean pop singer. However, E-Sang integrated traditional folk song rhythm and atmosphere with a Korean traditional percussion quartet to add their unique touch to the song.""Moon Song"" conveys optimism for a brighter future, similar to a full moon, as well as relief to individuals who are bored with their daily lives. The breezy ballad was also performed by E-Sang in the final round of the Korean Folk Song Talent TV Show ""Pungrye Daejang.""To top it all off, the talented band tugged at the heart-strings, after singing ""Ami Banglay Gaan Gai"", with the same level of ingenuity and soulfulness as any Bengali speaking person would. The performers and organizers exchanged warm greetings before the event came to a close – a memorable one for not only enthusiasts of Korean culture, but music lovers in general."
/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/shohel-mondol-actor-born-3133336,Shohel Mondol: An actor is born,"Shohel Mondol — an award winner at the Blender's Choice-The Daily Star OTT & Digital Content Awards 2021 gets nostalgic as we were discussing how he developed his penchant for acting. Mondol claims that he used to be an ""introvert"" while growing up in the beautiful pastoral set-up of Dhunat, an upazila in Bogura, a major district in Rajshahi division in northern Bangladesh. His ancestral village is situated in that upazila. While he considers himself to be blessed to have grown up in an extended family, he was not too keen in mingling with his boisterous gang of cousins. To stay away from all the hullabaloo, he would often resort to books.""Books for me were the ultimate saviour as they used to transport me to a different world, a world full of fantasy! I used to immerse myself in those books' pages and embark on a journey,"" says Shohel Mondol.  Sitting inside the makeup room of a studio, there is no power and the newly bought generator at the studio building is not functioning. The room has no window to allow any daylight. There is this eerie darkness all around us with the torchlight of my mobile phone being the only source of light.""It never crossed my mind that someday I too can become an actor. I just wanted to read and set on a journey with the characters depicted in those stories. As I grow up, besides books, watching movies in a nearby cinema hall started to become my favourite pastime,"" Shohel continues.He was one of those lucky 90s kids who would frequent cinema halls to watch movies of late heroes like Salman Shah or Manna.""The social drama and action of those heroes fascinated me; although I never wanted to be like them. It was purely for entertainment purposes,"" he clarifies. After moving to Dhaka, Shohel met with a new bunch of friends. There too, he started having that feeling of not fitting well. He could not resonate with the topics his friends were discussing. He was looking for an escape route.The bookstalls of Nilkhet saved him from the ultimate boredom. He started buying books and reading those to feed his soul that was hungry to go on expeditions with various characters.""I don't remember who actually introduced me to the idea of watching a stage performance. I started attending theatre shows. Eventually I developed an urge to meet the actors face to face. I even used to stand at the gate of FDC to have a glimpse of the heroes and heroines,"" Shohel chuckles and gives me a look as if I was going to judge him for doing so.He absolutely loved the performances in theatres and one day he discovered that he could join the troops and learn acting.""My ultimate intention was to see the performers up close. So, I joined 'Nagorik Natyongon Institute of Drama', where I was trained and got the opportunity to work at Nagorik Natyangan for two years. After that I joined Prachyanat School of Acting & Design for further schooling. I have been working with them for the last 12-13 years.""""So, theatre helped you overcome the shyness?"" I asked.""Oh yes, big time. I owe it to my teachers, co-performers and friends for my ultimate metamorphosis in all these years and I am grateful to Prachyanat,"" he says. As our chit chat continues, I keep looking at my watch as the studio owner said the loadshedding in Niketan usually continues for 10-15 minutes. It has been half an hour and we both are sweating profusely. I am relieved that Shohel did not get fussy at all sitting in that condition. As I keep apologising for the situation, Shohel assures me that he is ok.""I think having a more considerate approach to situations we face in everyday life makes our living easier. I can adapt very easily with any situation; which probably also helped me in acting,"" Mondol adds.The young actor has already received much accolades for the different types of characters he has portrayed on screen so far. So, is there any character that he is yearning to portray at present? Shohel says, ""I would love to do a so-called masala film, the ones I grew up watching. This kind of films has a mass appeal and they are needed for the industry to sustain. Having said that, the new breed of directors is making us hopeful and I am grateful to be a part of this momentum.""At that point of our discussion, the power comes back. The lights are on, so is the aircon. Shohel sits for his makeup and our conversation continues.""Are you always this easy going,"" I ask him, directly. With his signature heart-warming smile Shohel says that he always appreciates honesty and transparency in every situation.""I can sense if someone is being dishonest with me; I am definitely not going to be cooperative in those situations. However, if I am having a mood swing, I try to stay aloof and reflect on the situation or the role I am going to play. I definitely put much effort to understand the character on the script,"" the versatile actor elaborates.So, would you call yourself moody? When asked, Shohel replies: ""I give a lot of preference to my mood. What many audiences don't  know is that I worked as a full-time video editor for several renowned projects. My mood at the time of editing certainly reflected on the colour corrections of the footages.""We are almost at the end of our interview. The set is ready. Our makeup man Hossain too does a decent job in hiding Shohel's grey hairs which will somehow conflict with the look and get up we thought for him on the mood board. Before we start the shoot, I throw my last question to him — ""Any big plans this year?""""See, I don't plan that much. I am going to do this new web series which will be featured on an international OTT platform. One of my earlier work, Mayar Janjal which I did with Aupee Karim, my most favourite actor gets released this year. This makes me happy. Earlier I didn't have much choice, but now since people are recognising my work, I am getting to choose the roles, particularly which are more contemporary or challenging in nature to portray. That's all,"" he concludes with his charming smile. Model: Shohel Mondol

/daily-star-books/news/rising-dollar-prices-impact-book-trade-3133321,Rising dollar prices impact book trade ,"With the price of paper rising worldwide, the prices of printed books, magazines, and newspapers too are increasing rapidly. Printed books are becoming inaccessible to readers. As a result, publishers are fearing that the number of readers as well as buyers will gradually decrease. The rise in dollar prices is a major reason, driven by the post-pandemic situation and the Russia-Ukraine war. Publishers in some countries have even stopped publishing books. The most crucial time to sell books in Bangladesh is during the Amar Ekushey Book Fair in February, preparations for which are underway right now. Although the paper for books is produced in the country, the mills are dependent for their supply of ink and plate on foreign raw materials. The price of books is thus subject to increase. Mofiuddin, proprietor of Amanot Trade—a paper dealer in the capital's Nayabazar area— told The Daily Star, ""The price of paper was stable during the pandemic, but the recent hike in the price of a dollar has caused the price of paper to increase too much. If one rim (item) of local paper was earlier priced at BDT 1,300, the current price is BDT 1,900; glossy sticker paper was BDT 2,000, now it is BDT 3,000. Carbon paper was priced at BDT 2,400, now it is BDT 3,300; foreign offset was BDT 3,500, it is BDT 4,850 at present. This is happening due to the price of paper fluctuating with dollar prices.""""Everytime there is a hike in the price of paper, we have to adjust things and that results in readers having to bear the extra cost. This is happening everywhere—people have to buy their daily necessities at a higher price, meaning that they are less likely to buy books"", said Mahrukh Mohiuddin, Managing Director of The University Press Limited (UPL). ""This will dampen people's motivation to publish books. I think the overall crisis will have a negative impact. Won't this naturally lead to the erosion of our intellectual practices?"" she asks. Shahidul Islam Biju, owner of Pathak Shamabesh bookstore, shares, ""We haven't yet raised the price of books even though prices of everything in the country, including printing and paper, have soared up. We have to consider these things while reprinting books. Prices of foreign books have also gone up. We have maintained our old prices so far, for the sake of our readers. But I don't know if we'll be able to continue this.""The trend seems to be apparent worldwide. Publishers Weekly cited in February that the US based publication giant Ingram is going to increase the overall price of a book by six percent. Front Edge Publishing's supply chain uses Ingram's Lightning Source system. This is a global network of book production which distributes books to readers from North America to all around the globe. According to Janice Butler, senior manager of Ingram Content Group, Russia is an important source of timber for Europe, and since the invasion of Ukraine, this trade has completely stopped. And one of the materials for making paper is wood. The Times of India similarly reports increases in the price of paper affecting the Bangla publishing industry in West Bengal as the input costs—paper, ink, binding materials, and transport costs—have increased. In Pakistan, meanwhile, a report by The News says that the price of paper has more than doubled across the country due to their government's lack of interest in stabilising prices. Aziz Khalid, chairman of the Pakistan Publishers and Booksellers Association, pointed out that no paper is available for the publication of Sindh Text Book Board books. Writer Ahmad Mustafa Kamal tells The Daily Star, ""For those who read books, reading is not just a luxury, but a part of their life. It is an indispensable tool to lead a healthy life. Food prices are increasing, travel costs are increasing, medicine prices are increasing, which means everything is spiralling out of control now. How will we survive if this continues?""Translated by Maisha Syeda and Hrishik Roy.
