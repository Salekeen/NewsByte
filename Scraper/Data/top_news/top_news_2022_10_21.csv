/shout/news/why-are-so-many-genres-dying-out-3148681,Why are so many genres dying out?,"Rom-coms, chick flicks and teen movies from the 1990's and 2000's are still considered to be some of the best ones made of those genres. Films such as The Notebook, Clueless, Legally Blonde and many others are cult classics that people still reference even to this day. While some not all of them have aged very well, they are well loved and taken the form of comfort watches for many people even after all this time, and will continue to be for the years to come.But most of the movies of this genre that have been released in recent years don't garner the same love. Very few of the recent releases are actually well-received by critics or audiences, and a lot of the views come from people who hate-watch it just to see how bad it can be. So, what is the reason for this drop in quality?It starts with the fall of DVDs and rise of streaming services. Previously, films would be first released in the box office, and then a few months later, it would be available for rent or purchase. This meant they could earn more and over a longer period of time. Since DVDs have completely been replaced by streaming services, this secondary source of income no longer exists.Standalone movies with frivolous plots were hardly ever box office hits, and would rely on DVD sales to turn a profit, but now they have to wait to be licensed by a streaming service to be their primary source of income.If something isn't automatically popular, then the chances of them being picked up by streaming services become very low, so they're just not guaranteed to be profitable anymore.Nowadays, the only films that give its makers any kind of gains now are either sequels of existing franchises for being easy box office hits, or art films that at least bag a few nominations at major award shows. Because of this, big-name production houses, talented writers and A-listers exclusively focus on these two types of movies.After all, why should they bother with a silly movie that brings them nothing in the near future when they can work on something that can at least give them a decent paycheque or some exposure in the form of awards? Movies like Mean Girls that were made with love, and starred actors that could pull off the script don't exist anymore, because no one knows when they'll make a profit or at least gain a cult following. So, they are considered not worth the hassle.There is still some demand for these movies, and now they're mostly produced by streaming services or low-budget production houses, so they don't generally have the same level of attention given to them. Most of their screenplays now are adapted from Wattpad novels-turned-published books like After, or just have questionable scripts like Tall Girl. The actors they employ aren't usually charming enough to pull it off either, and so what could be a campy, mindless watch just becomes plain unbearable.This doesn't mean that all movies of this type are bad. Netflix's Do Revenge was relatively well-received, and are leading some to believe that maybe there might be a resurgence of these movies again. Hopefully, we don't have to rely on films released 20-30 years ago for some feel-good vibes.Namreen is sick and tired. Send a reminder that life goes on at: namreen.shaiyaz@gmail.com

Witnesses said many were seen carrying hockey sticks at that time.Khulna city Awami League General Secretary MDA Babul Rana told The Daily Star, ""BNP has called for a scheduled rally. We don't believe it has to be resisted or prevented. They will talk about them, we will talk about us. The public will consider who is right.""Sujit Adhikari, general secretary of the district Awami League, said they will remain cautious so that there is no chaos and loss of life and property."
/news/asia/south-asia/news/pakistan-grey-list-global-terror-financing-3148696,"Pakistan off ""grey list"" in global terror financing","Pakistan has been removed from an international grey list that warrants increased surveillance for terrorism financing, the head of the international money laundering watchdog which makes the list said on Friday.The decision, which provides a boost to the reputation of the crisis-ridden South Asian nation, was taken at the end of a two-day meeting in Paris, Financial Action Task Force (FATF) president T Raja Kumar told a news conference.""After a lot of work by the Pakistani authorities, they have worked through two separate action plans and completed a combined 34 action items to address deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing systems,"" FATF president T Raja Kumar told a news conference in Paris.In a meeting in June, the FATF had said it was keeping Pakistan on the so-called ""grey list"", but said it might be removed after an on-site visit to verify progress.Kumar said a FATF team had visited Pakistan and was satisfied with the implementation of the programme.""Pakistan exiting the FATF grey list is a vindication of our determined and sustained efforts over the years,"" Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Twitter.Pakistan was listed in 2018 because of ""strategic counter-terrorist financing-related deficiencies"".Even though the country had been removed from list, ""there is work to be done,"" Raja said, adding that the FATF encouraged Pakistan to strengthen its monitoring mechanisms.With its removal from the list, Pakistan would essentially receive a reputational boost and get a clean bill of health from the international community on terrorist financing.It would also improve sentiment, important from a foreign direct investment perspective.Recent widespread floods in Pakistan have further weakened the country's economy, already in turmoil with a rising current account deficit, inflation above 20% and a sharp depreciation of the rupee currency."
/news/asia/south-asia/news/sri-lanka-trims-presidential-powers-constitutional-amendment-3148671,Sri Lanka trims presidential powers via constitutional amendment,"Sri Lanka's parliament on Friday passed a constitutional amendment aimed at trimming presidential powers, beefing up anti-corruption safeguards and helping to find a way out of the country's worst financial crisis since independence.Sri Lanka has struggled for months to find enough dollars to pay for essential imports such as fuel, food, cooking gas and medicine.Many Sri Lankans blame former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa for implementing multiple failed policies including tax cuts, a now-reversed ban on chemical fertilisers and delays in seeking IMF assistance that resulted in the country defaulting on its foreign debt for the first time in history.As a response to widespread protests, Rajapaksa had backed constitutional reforms that would reduce the powers of the executive presidency and allocate them to parliament in June. He resigned the next month after protesters stormed his office and residence.""This amendment will not only help bring about the system change demanded by Sri Lankans it will also help in securing an IMF programme and other international assistance to rebuild the economy,"" Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe told parliament.In September, Sri Lanka signed an early deal with the IMF for a loan of $2.9 billion, with pledges to improve regulations to fight corruption.Opposition parties and civil society representatives, however, have slammed the amendment as not far-reaching enough in promoting accountability and reducing government powers.""This is just tinkering with presidential powers and the amendment does not implement significant change,"" said Bhavani Fonseka, a senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a Colombo-based think tank.""The president still retains the power to prorogue parliament, to hold ministries and the constitutional council will still have mostly government appointees.""The amendment was passed with the required two-thirds majority."
/news/world/uk/news/boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-top-contenders-uk-pm-3148661,"Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak top contenders for UK PM","Boris Johnson and his former finance minister Rishi Sunak were leading potential contenders to replace British Prime Minister Liz Truss on Friday, with candidates canvassing support to become Conservative Party leader in a fast-tracked contest.Truss, chosen by party members to succeed Johnson after he was ousted by his lawmakers in July, quit herself on Thursday after six turbulent weeks in power.Those who want to replace her must secure 100 nominations from Conservative lawmakers by Monday to run in a contest which the party hopes will reset its ailing fortunes.With opinion polls suggesting the Conservatives would be all but wiped out if a national election were held now, the race is on to become the fifth British premier in six years. An election is not due to be held for two years.The winner will be announced on Monday or next Friday.In what would be an extraordinary comeback, Johnson, who remains popular with party members was being touted alongside Sunak as a likely candidate.""He can turn it around again. And I'm sure my colleagues hear that message loud and clear,"" Conservative lawmaker Paul Bristow told LBC radio. ""Boris Johnson can win the next general election.""But Johnson, who left office comparing himself to a Roman dictator twice brought into power to fight crises, might not reach the 100 nomination threshold after his three-year premiership was blighted by scandals and allegations of misconduct.The Financial Times said a Boris comeback would be ""farcical"".One of his former advisers, who no longer speaks to Johnson and requested not to be identified, said he was unlikely to reach the target, having alienated dozens of Conservative lawmakers.Will Walden, who also once worked for Johnson, said the former leader was returning from holiday and taking soundings.Business minister Jacob Rees-Mogg tweeted his support, using the hashtag ""#Borisorbust"".Defence Secretary Ben Wallace ruled himself out of the running and said he was leaning towards backing Johnson, who led the party to a large majority at a 2019 national election.Sunak, the former Goldman Sachs analyst who became finance minister just as the Covid-19 pandemic arrived in Europe and was runner-up to Truss in the summer's leadership contest, is the favourite with bookmakers, followed by Johnson.Third-placed is Penny Mordaunt, a former defence minister popular with party members who came third last time. None have formally declared their candidacy.A Reuters tally of Conservative lawmakers who have made public declarations of support put Sunak on 54 backers, Johnson on 29 and Mordaunt on 16.Britain's shortest-serving prime minister, Truss quit after her economic plans were rejected by investors, hitting the pound and pushing up borrowing costs, forcing a U-turn under a new finance minister after she sacked her closest political ally.The sight on Thursday of yet another unpopular prime minister making a resignation speech in Downing Street - and the start of a new leadership race - underscored how volatile British politics has become since the 2016 Brexit vote.Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said Brexit had brought instability to Britain.""I hope that they will soon be stable because even if they are not a family member anymore they are a friend and a neighbour. We need them and they need us too,"" he told reporters on arrival for an EU summit in Brussels.The Conservative Party has a big majority in parliament and can ignore calls for an election, but opposition parties, some newspapers and even a few of its own lawmakers have said voters should now be given a say.""The Tories (Conservatives) cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,"" Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said.""They do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment.""Some Conservative lawmakers have urged colleagues to coalesce around one candidate to minimise the bruising.Sunak, who had warned that Truss's fiscal plan threatened the economy, remains unpopular with some party members after he helped to trigger the rebellion against Johnson.Mordaunt is seen as a fresh face, largely untainted by earlier administrations but is also untested.The next leader will inherit an economy heading for recession, with rising interest rates and inflation over 10% leaving millions facing a cost-of-living squeeze.Surveys on Friday showed British shoppers have reined in their spending sharply and put their confidence levels near record lows, while worse-than-expected public borrowing figures underscored the economic challenges ahead.Truss's spokeswoman said work was continuing on a fiscal plan due to be set out on October 31 but that it would be for her successor to decide whether to proceed with it.Whoever takes over also has a mountain to climb to restore the party's own reputation.""Whether or not a change of leader is going to be sufficient to make the Conservatives actually electorally credible is certainly highly debatable,"" political scientist John Curtice told LBC."

Police later arrested examinee Shafiqul Islam, room invigilators Kabir Iqbal and Ahmed Zibril and peon Zahurul Islam.Pirganj Upazila Social Service Officer Md Rafiqul Islam filed a case with Thakurgaon Police Station against eight persons including the four arrestees in this connection. Mentionable, the recruitment test for the post of Grade III social worker for the 16th batch across the country was held today.At least 10,788 job seekers have applied from Thakurgaon.

/opinion/views/news/will-earth-remain-inhabitable-after-2050-3148491,Will Earth remain inhabitable after 2050?,"It is quite a dicey time for our planet. In the last 100 years or so, because of our unrestrained use of fossil fuels and systematic overexploitation of the natural resources, we have pushed the planet towards climatological catastrophe. Simply put, we dug ourselves into a deep hole, yet we have not stopped digging.To pull us out of the hole, world leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris Accords to keep the ""global temperature increase in this century to two degrees Celsius while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees."" In order to achieve this goal, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) wants us to halve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 and attain net zero emissions by 2050.With that in mind, our leaders are going to meet for the 27th time, from November 6-18, in Sharm el-Sheikh, a resort town in Egypt, to discuss an array of issues related to climate change and renew for the sixth time their commitment to deliver on the Paris Agreement.Realistically speaking, at the current pace of GHG emissions that is even faster than what was predicted in the early 21st century, and, more importantly, our leaders back-pedalling on the pledges made at the Paris conference, the blueprint for net zero emissions seems like a pipe dream. Under these circumstances, the state of our planet in 2050 seems frightening.In Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, as well as Europe and North America, summer will arrive months earlier, and with vengeance, as it did in 2021 and 2022. Persistent heat waves will afflict much of the population, resulting in hundreds of thousands of heat-related deaths. Furthermore, it is highly likely that the wet-bulb temperature will oftentimes surpass 35 degrees Celsius, which is the upper limit of human adaptability to heat and humidity. Extremely hot summers will mean more frequent, intense and wide-ranging forest fires burning more trees that will release more carbon dioxide, driving global temperatures even higher. The smog-filled filthy air will kill countless people living nearby. In addition to dirtier air, warmer weather will act as a catalyst for chemical reactions, producing many toxic pollutants, including ground-level ozone which, when inhaled, will aggravate respiratory conditions like asthma and emphysema.As the world warms, rainfalls in Bangladesh during monsoon will become more erratic, less predictable, frightfully dangerous, and immeasurably devastating. The recent cataclysmic floods in Bangladesh's Sylhet and Pakistan due to record monsoon rains and melting glaciers in the Himalayas indicate that by 2050, villages will become small islands in an inland sea. Besides floods, heavy and incessant rainfalls will trigger landslides that have already demolished many homes and claimed hundreds of lives in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and high mountain regions in Asia and elsewhere. In sum, the changing pattern of monsoon will put millions of people in peril.Augmented by rising sea levels, cyclonic storms will cause the coastal cliffs in Bangladesh, that act as natural barriers against high tides, to collapse. As a consequence, people living in low-lying coastal areas will experience incursions of seawater more often during storm surges, where freshwater supplies will be contaminated and undrinkable, agricultural land will be damaged because of increased salinity, and waterborne diseases will become increasingly common. Additionally, along with many coastal cities and island nations, a large portion of Bangladesh will be underwater.Massive build-up of heat will turn the high latitude regions of the northern hemisphere – within and outside the Arctic Circle – into wastelands. Inland glaciers, a major source of freshwater, will become a thing of the past. A hotter climate in the Arctic belt will impact the global climate system as a whole through the enhanced release of greenhouse gases, especially the highly potent methane, from thawed permafrost.According to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, global warming will turn more than 25 percent of the Earth into desert. The Sahara Desert will extend to parts of southern Europe. A warmer Earth will exacerbate droughts, mainly outside of the tropics, with far-reaching consequences. They will be drawn-out, leading to acute shortages of water and mass starvation in many parts of the world. Droughts will also drastically raise the number of climate refugees.The UN's International Office of Migration (IOM) speculates that by 2050, over a billion people will be displaced globally due to climate change. The number of people living in cities will likely triple. People in Dhaka, currently 22.5 million, can expect to rub their shoulders with an additional 13–15 million climate refugees.Food insecurity, dearth of water and energy, together with depleted resources, will provide the spark that will push otherwise peaceful nations into war. Moreover, famine, poverty, unstable governments, vast inequalities within societies, and control for life-sustaining resources will incite riots and civil wars.This is just a small glimpse into what our planet may look like in 2050. To keep our planet inhabitable beyond 2050, we need courageous, visionary leaders with new ideas. Arguably, most of the leaders of the major GHG-emitting nations lack these traits.So, what is the endgame? In January 2016, British-born American astronaut and climate scientist Piers Sellers wrote in The New York Times on his perspectives on climate change, ""There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks. History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots. The winners tended to be realistic, pragmatic, and flexible; the losers were often in denial of the threat.""Sellers' optimistic take on confronting climate change gives us hope for the future. Hence, the doom and gloom picture painted here is not the endgame, nor is it an inevitable future. However, because climate change cannot be curbed through established political systems controlled by the ""losers,"" concerned citizens have to shape the agenda through grassroots work. Otherwise, our planet will be thrown off its axis, plunging into an irreversible feedback loop of ever-hotter, ever-deadlier conditions. And by 2050, uninhabitability of the Earth may become a harsh reality.Dr Quamrul Haider is a professor of physics at Fordham University in New York, US.

/news/bangladesh/news/it-was-eyewash-3148286,"Stakeholders’ consultation mostly ignored in final draft of social media, OTT regulation","Even though Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) had invited feedback on the draft of its new social media regulation, the finalised version shows that little or no heed was paid to the major stakeholders.Last Wednesday, BTRC gave the High Court the meeting minutes of the last three sessions held by the Regulation Formation Committee when finalising the draft of the regulation. The minutes portray that crucial feedback given by stakeholders was not even discussed, let alone adopted.The finalised ""BTRC Regulation for Digital, Social Media and OTT Platforms"" was submitted to the High Court on the same day.The final draft allows the government to order individuals to take down content, empowers it to order social media companies to block content, and grants it indemnity for its actions under the law.Over the months, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), Bangladesh Legal Aid Services Trust (BLAST), Global Network Initiatives and others sent feedback ringing alarm bells about the government constricting the space for free expression.BLAST, in its recommendations, had told BTRC that ""imposing restrictions on the creation and dissemination of online content will create a chilling effect on freedom of expression concerning issues of rights and justice, including by and about marginalised communities, and will inhibit democratic debate and discourse.""""The grounds on which social media intermediaries are required to take down content are similar to certain Digital Security Act provisions that have already been identified by commentators as arbitrarily restricting freedom of speech and expression,"" read the recommendations by BLAST.The grounds on which social media intermediaries are required to take down content are similar to certain Digital Security Act provisions that have already been identified by commentators as arbitrarily restricting freedom of speech and expression. BLAST, in its recommendations on the regulation
This includes content that threatens the ""unity, integrity, defence, security, or sovereignty of Bangladesh, [and its] friendly relations with foreign states"" or ""is against the Liberation War of Bangladesh, the spirit of the Liberation War, the Father of the Nation, the national anthem, or the national flag"", ""threatens the secrecy of the government"" or ""creates unrest or disorder or deteriorates the law and order situation"" or ""threatens public order"".
TIB had pointed out that requiring all social media intermediaries, tech companies, internet service providers, OTT platforms and online news publishers to get locally registered, and empowering BTRC to cancel the registration if their activities go against the regulation will put them in a bodysuit.
It said it puts foreign companies at risk of surveillance and disincentivises them from operating in Bangladesh.
These concerns -- among many others -- were not addressed and the finalised draft still retains these provisions.
The BTRC submission to the HC reads, ""It was agreed that the Regulation shall be finalised after necessary consideration and/or evaluation of the feedback/input from several concerned stakeholders in this regard.""
Yet this commitment to evaluate feedback from stakeholders is not reflected in the meeting minutes.
During the eleventh session, held on September 4, the committee reviewed the definitions of terms like ""content"", ""digital device"", ""intermediary"" and ""curated content"".
Two weeks later, on September 18, the committee met again for their twelfth session. They discussed and decided that companies that are already registered, do not need to register again. However, it did not speak of doing away with the requirement.
During this meeting, they decided to adopt one feedback made by Global Network Initiatives (GNI), a collective whose members include Meta, Microsoft, Uber, Zoom, Telenor Group, Yahoo, Google, Nokia, Vodafone, Verizon, Human Rights Watch, Wikimedia, Committee to Protect Journalists and others.
GNI had expressed alarm at the fact that the draft regulation features excessive penalties for violations, including fines of up to Tk 3 billion and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years and targets company personnel.
During the 12th meeting, the committee decided to scrap criminal liability, and include corporate liability instead. The latest draft kept intact provisions for fines if the regulations were violated but removed the ceilings that were mentioned in the previous drafts. Instead, it just added that the ""fine should not be excessive"".
In addition, during the 12th meeting, the committee dropped the section in the previous draft that forced companies to circumvent end-to-end encryption and identify ""first originators"" of any content or message sent.
Ten days later, the committee met for the 13th time, and finalised the draft, leaving key concerns up in the air.
Ashish Kumar Kundu, the director-general (legal and licensing division), who signed the meeting minutes, told this newspaper that many stakeholders were consulted and met with before this draft was finalised.
The commissioner of the division was contacted several times over the phone, but this newspaper was unable to reach him.

Their till then classified booster rocket can help bring Watney back and they offer to do so. After a highly complex manoeuvre and intense happy-ending drama à la Hollywood, Watney returns.But such collaborations between the two space powers can happen only in movies because Americans enacted a law in 2011 to stop just that. Republican Congressman Frank Wolf introduced a bill to bar NASA and all other American agencies from working with Chinese organisations. The bill, known as the Wolf Amendment, practically blocks all avenues of collaboration between the two most active space players. The battle for economic, technological, and geopolitical superiority has thus gone to space. In the International Space Station (ISS), Washington has deliberately excluded Beijing where hundreds of astronauts from 19 nations including Moscow have participated.However, instead of stalling, such exclusions have only persuaded Beijing to build its own space station, the Tiangong, which is scheduled for completion this year. The plan for ISS is decommissioning in 2024, and if the US and its partners do not extend its life, Tiangong may become the only crewed outpost in orbit. China has invited all nations to join it, but the Wolf Amendment will bar NASA astronauts from doing so even if they want to.China is a late entrant in the space race. It put the first satellite into orbit in 1970 after which there wasn't much progress for a long time. It has, however, caught up and in the past 10 years, launched more than two hundred crewed and uncrewed spaceships. In December 2020, it sent an uncrewed mission, Chang'e 5, to the Moon to collect rock samples from a site not visited by any other nation before. China's progress in space has so far been stunning, which General John Raymond, chief of space operations of the US Space Force has summarised as ""from zero to 60 really quick."" China also completed its own satellite navigation system BeiDou in 2020, offering complete global navigation service like America's GPS, Europe's Galileo, and Russia's GNSS. On January 2, 2019, China landed a space probe on the dark side of the moon, which no other nation has done yet. In July, China's first successful interplanetary mission completed mapping the Red Planet a little over a year after its arrival.China's fast-progressing space technology has raised concerns that it can be used as a weapon against enemy satellites. Space technology is inherently dual-purpose and can power low-end reversible jammers, direct energy weapons such as lasers, and direct-ascent kinetic missiles which can destroy any satellite in orbit. Judging from the developments so far, it is quite likely that China already owns such weapons for use in a conflict. Fuelling such speculations further, China destroyed a defunct weather satellite with a missile in 2007 producing a large amount of space debris. Last year, its researchers successfully tested an anti-satellite robotic device, which can produce a time-controlled, steady explosion with little or no debris.All these unmissably point to how China's space technology is leapfrogging and may soon catch up with the Americans, though not all experts agree. Until now the USA is ahead of China in the space race and is likely to remain so in the coming years. Despite China sending more rockets in 2021, America's total number of satellites and payload capacities in orbit far exceeds those of China. The other advantage Washington enjoys over Beijing is the active role played by a thriving commercial space industry, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin (SpaceX provides internet to Ukraine's forces and Iranian protesters).These facts are, however, of little comfort to Washington as it, along with its allies, is trying to stall or at least slowdown Beijing's progress in every possible way. In 2020, SSC Space Australia (a subsidiary of Swedish Space Corporation) declared that it won't extend the contract for China to use its space tracking station in Western Australia. Beijing, however, has already made alternative arrangements with another such station in Kiribati.The most recent battle in the space war is being fought on the moon, as both nations plan to set up lunar bases for long-term settlements and resource exploitation. In August, NASA's Artemis 3 and CNSA'a Chang'e-7 missions released their lists of potential landing sites only to find that some of them overlap. How they come to an agreement on this issue is yet to be seen.Will it be possible for Washington to stall Beijing's progress in space technology? Is cooperation a more pragmatic choice than competition? Will Washington remove the legal bars that prevent cooperation? Given the successive American administrations' policies towards China (Obama's China containment policy, Trump's trade war, and Biden's chip war), presently that seems unlikely. Meanwhile, China continues its space odyssey as Tiangong's final module is ready to blast off.Dr Sayeed Ahmed is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation."

/news/bangladesh/news/housing-secretaries-luxury-the-time-austerity-3148146,Housing for secretaries: Luxury in the time of austerity,"The recent decision to build ""luxurious residences"" at the cost of Tk 42.85 crore for the cabinet and principal secretaries by the housing and public works ministry has drawn flak from different quarters.The widespread criticism comes at a time when people are repeatedly being advised to practise austerity to overcome the current economic crises.Experts say when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina herself has been repeatedly calling for cost cutting and restraint in public expenditure, such an atrociously expensive project funded by taxpayers' money is highly questionable.Former cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, ""I worked as [both] cabinet and principal secretaries, but I never felt the need for swimming pools or these many televisions [which are in the project proposal]. I never felt like I was in a sorry statewithout these.""In the Development Project Proposal (DPP), the Public Works Department, which is the implementing agency, claimed the project will create ""temporary employment opportunities"" during the implementation phase, which will ""help eradicate poverty to some extent"".Meanwhile, people from different quarters took to social media over the last couple of days to blast the initiative.Project documents indicatethe estimated cost of the two three-storey buildings is Tk 18.88 crore. Another Tk 22.5 crore will be spent on the interior and exterior designs and a service building.The Planning Commission, meanwhile, has decided to send the project proposal back to the housing and public works ministry, as it did not follow proper procedure, officials said.The ministry had directly sent the DPP to the physical planning, water supply and housing wing of the commission for approval, whereas it was supposed to be sent to the programming division, said an official, preferring anonymity.""It [the DPP] will now be sent back to the ministry.""According to the proper procedure, the proposal is first supposed to be sent to the programming division, which will then list it as an ""unapproved project"".It will then be sent to physical planning, water supply and housing wing, who will present it before the Project Evaluation Committee.""If the project then gets a nod and the cost is shown to be below Tk 50 crore, it is then presented to the planning minister for approval,"" the official said.Ali Imam Majumder suggested renovating existing residences and earmarking thoseas the homes of the cabinet and principal secretaries.""In terms of improvement, the sky is the limit. But this is not the right time. If their existing residences do not have enough facilities, these can be renovated at a reasonable cost,"" he said, adding that the project should be halted right away.According to the DPP, each of the three-storey building will be built on 18,000 square feetand will cost Tk 21.5 crore.There will be two swimming pools in each, which would cost another estimated Tk 5.1 crore.In the project description, the ministry said there were no permanent residences for the cabinet and principal secretaries.The cabinet secretary currently lives in the official residence in the capital's Minto Road, while the principal secretary's official residence is in Gulshan.A total of 14 LED televisions will be purchased at Tk 900,000 for the proposed homes.As many as 32 CCTV systems will be bought for those at the cost of Tk 600,000, while Tk 1.75 crore will be spent for the fire extinguishing systems.The cost of the 1,000 kg lifts (European Standard) is estimated at Tk 1.55 crore.Moreover, Tk 18 lakh will be spent to conserve rainwater.For official purposes, meeting with diplomats and overall security, there will be separate buildings.Shafiqul Islam, additional chief engineer of the public works department, said, ""They are the top government officials. If they don't deserve such facilities, thenwho does?""It [the project] will not be implemented right now. By the timeit will be, the economic situation will become normal.""Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh, said if the government is respectful to its commitment to transparent and accountable governance, it will be impossible to justifythe project to the public.""The approval of the project will send a message to the people that the government itself is ridiculing the pledges of austerity, and it has no qualms in spending public money to fund the disproportionately luxurious lifestyle of public officials, whose salaries and benefits are borne by the already overburdened common people.""Asked about the logic behind the project at a time like this, an additional secretary of the housing ministry said, ""We don't do anything on our own. We only execute plans that come from the top level."""

/sports/sports-special/t20-world-cup-2022/news/zimbabwe-make-it-super-12-and-enter-bangladeshs-group-3148581,Zimbabwe make it to Super 12 and enter Bangladesh's group,"Zimbabwe stormed into the Super 12 stage of the Twenty20 World Cup for the first time Friday at the expense of Scotland, beating them by five wickets with skipper Craig Ervine hitting a half-century.The African nation limited the Scots to 132-6 with tidy bowling led by Tendai Chatara (2-14) and Richard Ngarava (2-28) before rattling through the run chase with nine balls to spare.With the five-wicket win, Zimbabwe have topped their group and made it to Group 2 of the Super 12 involving India, Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh and Netherlands.Zimbabwe had been part of five previous World Cups but never gone beyond the first round before.But they have been improving since coach Dave Houghton, Zimbabwe's first Test captain back in 1992, came into the fold for his second stint in July.They beat Ireland to open their latest World Cup campaign then lost to the West Indies before booking their spot against the Scots.Scotland skipper Richie Berrington won the toss and opted to bat, but they were on the back foot immediately, losing Michael Jones, who struck a masterly 86 against Ireland, in the first over.Sikandar Raza took a superb over-the-shoulder catch off Chatara's bowling to dismiss him.Another spectacular diving catch was held by Wessly Madhevere at midwicket to remove Matthew Cross for one four overs later, leaving Scotland at 24-2 in the fifth over.Opener George Munsey remained calm at the other end and built a 40-run partnership with Berrington before the skipper holed out to Milton Shumba in the deep off Raza for 13.The run rate slowed in the face of some economical bowling as Munsey reached a ninth T20 half-century with a single, only to fall five balls later for 54, caught by Shumba off Ngarava, before Calum MacLeod (25) and Michael Leask (12) added crucial late runs.Zimbabwe started the chase with a four but then lost two wickets in eight balls.After smacking the boundary, Regis Chakabva was trapped lbw by Brad Wheal and then Madhevere departed without scoring, dragging a Josh Davey delivery onto his stumps.Sean Williams put on 35 in a partnership with Ervine, who missed their last match with a ""mild asthmatic attack"", but the stand was broken when Michael Leask came into the attack and he was caught by Wheal for seven.It left Zimbabwe on 55-3 after 10 overs.But Ervine kept his focus to notch a ninth T20 half-century, happy to play second fiddle to the dangerous Raza (40 off 23) who swung the bat before he was caught behind by Cross off Davey.When Ervine was out, chipping down the ground, they needed 14 off the last three overs, with Chris Greaves and Davey accomplishing the feat. "

/news/bangladesh/news/energy-economic-crises-they-may-extend-beyond-year-3148066,"Energy, economic crises may drag on beyond a year: CPD","The economic and energy crises that Bangladesh is facing may extend beyond a year, the Centre for Policy Dialogue said yesterday.The measures the government has taken to ride out these crises -- dollar crunch, energy shortfall, food insecurity, and soaring inflation -- are mostly on the right path. But they are inadequate and short-term in nature while the problems are likely to persist for the medium term, it noted.To overcome the crises, the independent think-tank recommended cost-effective production and employment-oriented measures, and also called for focusing on spending in areas that will benefit the poor.It suggested the government form a committee to monitor the key economic indicators and come up with policy advice and actions to tackle the growing crises.The committee will be comprised of representatives from the Prime Minister's Office, the ministries of finance, planning, commerce, power and energy, food, and agriculture as well as civil society members.The CPD yesterday unveiled its review on the challenges the country's economy is facing amid a global economic slowdown.""We are not going to get rid of the problems even in 2023. One cannot expect we will be free from these crises within the next one year,"" CPD Executive Director Fahmida Khatun told a press briefing at its office in the city.The nature of the current crises is global, and the world economy is adversely impacted by the challenges stemming from inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Covid pandemic.Mentioning that some domestic problems aggravated the crises in Bangladesh, she noted that the country's internal policies and plans should be strong, corruption removed and good governance ensured.All countries are facing the heat of the current global crisis but the ones whose internal policies are strong will fare better, she said.Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the CPD, said, ""The government has taken some steps to overcome the crises, considering them as short-term. We, however, are facing medium and long-term crises… if the problems are not addressed properly, they may lead to a job crisis and then to a political crisis.""Replying to a query, he said the government can take long-term loans from the International Monetary Fund or abroad to expand the fiscal space. The use of funds, however, should be proper.If funds are misused and capital is siphoned off abroad, the country will face even deeper problems, he pointed out.Had the government taken reform measures when the economy was in a better shape, it could have got more fiscal space and been in a better position to handle the situation.""But it [the government] spent over Tk 26,000 crore in the name of capacity charge for power companies in the last fiscal year… Many of the owners of those companies became rich but the government's fiscal space shrank.""Answering a question on food security, Moazzem said the food-importing countries will be in trouble if they face dollar shortage.Moreover, the government should focus on increasing food production and storage capacity, as food is now becoming a ""political commodity"" globally.""Agricultural subsidies should rise,"" he added.About the recent price hike, the CPD said the poor and low-income earners are facing increased hardship, as the living cost has been soaring since the spread of Covid in early 2020.These people continue to struggle because the burden of rising prices weighs more heavily on their meagre incomes.It is urgent to revisit and revise the minimum wages of workers in all industries immediately, according to the CPD.Private companies should consider a higher salary increment for all their employees to help them maintain their living standards.About the energy crisis, the think-tank said the power and energy sector is suffering the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war and the pandemic. Factories are not getting enough gas and electricity to carry on production as usual.The industries, especially gas-dependent textile, ceramics, glass, and steel factories, are struggling to meet the production targets.Recently, oil-exporting countries decided to cut oil production, which may put more pressure on Bangladesh since it is heavily dependent on imported petroleum.Based on a calculation, the CPD said Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation has been making profits since August.The BPC should revise down the fuel prices to help reduce inflationary pressure on the domestic market, the think-tank said, adding that Bangladesh took mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce energy use but hasn't given enough attention to renewables-based power generation.Falling forex reserves continue to be a cause for concern as it depleted to $36.3 billion as of October 12 due to high import bills and slow growth in remittance earnings. It was $41.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2021-22, the CPD said.It recommended ensuring market-based floating exchange rate to help improve the situation."
