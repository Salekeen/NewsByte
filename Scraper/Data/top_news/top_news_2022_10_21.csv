/sports/sports-special/t20-world-cup-2022/news/west-indies-out-t20-world-cup-ireland-reach-super-12-3148481,West Indies out of T20 World Cup as Ireland reach Super 12,"Veteran opener Paul Stirling slammed an unbeaten 66 as Ireland made the Twenty20 World Cup Super 12 on Friday and sent two-time champions West Indies crashing out in a stunning upset.Disciplined bowling restricted the Caribbean side to 146-5, with Gareth Delany taking a career-best 3-16, before the Irish romped to their target for the loss of just one wicket with 15 balls to spare in Hobart.Stirling, at his seventh World Cup, shared in a blistering 73-run opening stand with captain Andy Balbirnie to supercharge Ireland's run chase.The final Super 12 slot will be decided later Friday when Zimbabwe meet Scotland.The West Indies won the tournament in 2012 and 2016, but came to Australia with a new-look team after the likes of Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard retired, and Andre Russell was overlooked.They stumbled badly in their opening match against Scotland, crashing by 42 runs, before recovering to emphatically beat Zimbabwe.But in Ireland, who are playing in their seventh straight World Cup and had only been beyond the first round once before, in 2009, they again hit the wall.After the West Indies won the toss and batted at a breezy Bellerive Oval in Hobart, the Irish bowlers sent down nine dot balls among their first 15.In frustration, Kyle Mayers launched at a delivery from Barry McCarthy and was caught by Harry Tector at mid-off for one.The dangerous Johnson Charles slammed 4-4-6 off Curtis Campher but his luck ran out in the next over, slicing to Campher off spinner Simi Singh for 24.Brandon King, who missed the West Indies' last game with illness, was dropped two balls later and made the most of the opportunity, crunching four boundaries to steer them to 67-2 at halfway.Evin Lewis received treatment for a hamstring issue and was out soon after for 13, ending a 44-run partnership.Skipper Nicholas Pooran (13) and Rovman Powell (6) didn't last against a quality attack as King (62 not out) did his best to push the scoreboard forward.In reply, Ireland got off to a cracking start with Stirling and Balbirnie on a mission, blazing 54 off the first five overs, with eight boundaries, four of them sixes.The spin of Akeal Hosein finally gave the West Indies a breakthrough in the eighth over with Balbirnie caught by Mayers after an entertaining 37 off 23 balls to end a decisive opening stand.The run rate dipped but Stirling, in his 177th international, kept going and reached his 21st T20 half-century with another boundary and with Lorcan Tucker (45 not out) saw them home."

/daily-star-books/news/post-ssc-reads-3148531,Post-SSC musings: Books that helped me navigate my vacation,"After my SSC exams ended, I felt that all my textbooks, notes, and past question papers were just staring at me. It was as if they were looking at me with the slightest bit of mockery. Despite the regret I felt for not studying them with honest academic interest, the goal of having to go through those academic books did provide me a sense of purpose. However, now that exams were over, I realised that I had to replace those mundane books with more fascinating ones.These books that I read and had helped me navigate the post-SSC days more adventurously.CIRCEMadeline Miller
Little, Brown and Company (2018)Circe, the daughter of Helios and the sorceress goddess, is famously known in Greek Mythology for turning Odysseus's crew into swine. The book Circe is written in Homeric narrative but concentrates heavily on the female gaze and how differently the tales will always be told by a man. Even though Odysseus plays a huge role in this story, the central, driving force in the story is Circe becoming her greatest self. We get to see her question what it means to be immortal, to be a nymph in a world ruled by gods, and what it means just to live. Madeline Miller's Circe is not a lovelorn, lonely heart desperate for connection in her isolation, but a multi-faceted character, with inner seams encompassing both dark and light. Her journey was unlike anything I had ever read before, and probably unlike anything I will ever read again.THE BELL JARSylvia Plath
Heinemann (1963)Sylvia Plath's only novel The Bell Jar is packed with bleak truths, difficult topics and wry, dark humour. The story is about a woman named Esther, who moves to New York City for an internship in a Fashion Magazine, while her mental health deteriorates in the process. She describes her depression as a suffocating feeling, like that of being in a bell jar. Plath's poetic prowess shows through her writing, especially the descriptions, and we understand how excruciatingly personal her poetry was. The book is often regarded as a roman á clef since the protagonist's descent into mental illness parallels Plath's own experiences. While reading, Esther made me her accomplice in her jokes and in her secrets, and made me empathise with her plights. Despite the darkness in which this book is immersed, a sense of hope still lingers even after finishing this sombre journey. I am grateful for the story Plath shared, and for the fate she forged for her character.A STRANGER IN MY OWN COUNTRY: EAST PAKISTAN, 1969-1971Khadim Hussain Raja
The University Press Limited (2012)As Khadim Hussain Raja was the second in command in then East Pakistan, a biassed yet nuanced perspective about Bangladesh's independence is shown in his writing. The nonchalant way in which he writes about ""neutralising"" political leaders, student hostels, teachers' residents, cultural groups, and ""disarming"" East Bengal Regiments, EPR, and the police, I found deplorable. Even though he criticises the Pakistani military government, he glosses over the hot mess they created while running the country and downplays the extent of their actions and impact. This book sheds light on a good amount of events and decisions at a higher level but with few references to some incidents on the streets. It left my blood boiling in rage.FIRE AND BLOODGeorge R. R. Martin
Bantam Books (2018)With the recent release of the HBO series House of the Dragon, this is the perfect time to read Fire and Blood and get truly immersed in the story. Fire and Blood details, as the title suggests, the history of the Targaryen Kings; this first volume spans the time from the reign of Aegon the Conqueror to his sixth successor Aegon III, who sat on the Iron Throne 130 years after Aegon the Dragon and his sisters first set foot on Westerosi soil. No doubt author George Martin has an outstanding ability in fantasy world-building that draws his readers in. For the three days I spent reading the book, I forgot the outside world existed. THE ANTHROPOCENE REVIEWEDJohn Green
Penguin Random House (2021)The Anthropocene Reviewed is the latest book by John Green. This essay collection grapples with the world that the humans have inhabited for all these years, but within the context of the early days of the pandemic. That is why reading it feels like a historical document that is also very recent. Each one of the essays takes an idea from everyday life, from culture, from society, and pulls it apart and creates a venue to discuss wider social issues. John Green has a great gift for tackling complex thoughts and ideas through everyday metaphors that we can all understand.Every one of these books took me on a compelling journey, and made me question the seemingly monotonous aspects of life. Beginning to read after so long, it has allowed me to be a part of something bigger than myself. Through reading them, I rediscovered the sense of purpose that I had lost when SSC ended.Isra Kabir is a contributor to Daily Star Books. "
/news/bangladesh/news/housing-secretaries-luxury-the-time-austerity-3148146,Housing for secretaries: Luxury in the time of austerity,"The recent decision to build ""luxurious residences"" at the cost of Tk 42.85 crore for the cabinet and principal secretaries by the housing and public works ministry has drawn flak from different quarters.The widespread criticism comes at a time when people are repeatedly being advised to practise austerity to overcome the current economic crises.Experts say when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina herself has been repeatedly calling for cost cutting and restraint in public expenditure, such an atrociously expensive project funded by taxpayers' money is highly questionable.Former cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, ""I worked as [both] cabinet and principal secretaries, but I never felt the need for swimming pools or these many televisions [which are in the project proposal]. I never felt like I was in a sorry statewithout these.""In the Development Project Proposal (DPP), the Public Works Department, which is the implementing agency, claimed the project will create ""temporary employment opportunities"" during the implementation phase, which will ""help eradicate poverty to some extent"".Meanwhile, people from different quarters took to social media over the last couple of days to blast the initiative.Project documents indicatethe estimated cost of the two three-storey buildings is Tk 18.88 crore. Another Tk 22.5 crore will be spent on the interior and exterior designs and a service building.The Planning Commission, meanwhile, has decided to send the project proposal back to the housing and public works ministry, as it did not follow proper procedure, officials said.The ministry had directly sent the DPP to the physical planning, water supply and housing wing of the commission for approval, whereas it was supposed to be sent to the programming division, said an official, preferring anonymity.""It [the DPP] will now be sent back to the ministry.""According to the proper procedure, the proposal is first supposed to be sent to the programming division, which will then list it as an ""unapproved project"".It will then be sent to physical planning, water supply and housing wing, who will present it before the Project Evaluation Committee.""If the project then gets a nod and the cost is shown to be below Tk 50 crore, it is then presented to the planning minister for approval,"" the official said.Ali Imam Majumder suggested renovating existing residences and earmarking thoseas the homes of the cabinet and principal secretaries.""In terms of improvement, the sky is the limit. But this is not the right time. If their existing residences do not have enough facilities, these can be renovated at a reasonable cost,"" he said, adding that the project should be halted right away.According to the DPP, each of the three-storey building will be built on 18,000 square feetand will cost Tk 21.5 crore.There will be two swimming pools in each, which would cost another estimated Tk 5.1 crore.In the project description, the ministry said there were no permanent residences for the cabinet and principal secretaries.The cabinet secretary currently lives in the official residence in the capital's Minto Road, while the principal secretary's official residence is in Gulshan.A total of 14 LED televisions will be purchased at Tk 900,000 for the proposed homes.As many as 32 CCTV systems will be bought for those at the cost of Tk 600,000, while Tk 1.75 crore will be spent for the fire extinguishing systems.The cost of the 1,000 kg lifts (European Standard) is estimated at Tk 1.55 crore.Moreover, Tk 18 lakh will be spent to conserve rainwater.For official purposes, meeting with diplomats and overall security, there will be separate buildings.Shafiqul Islam, additional chief engineer of the public works department, said, ""They are the top government officials. If they don't deserve such facilities, thenwho does?""It [the project] will not be implemented right now. By the timeit will be, the economic situation will become normal.""Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh, said if the government is respectful to its commitment to transparent and accountable governance, it will be impossible to justifythe project to the public.""The approval of the project will send a message to the people that the government itself is ridiculing the pledges of austerity, and it has no qualms in spending public money to fund the disproportionately luxurious lifestyle of public officials, whose salaries and benefits are borne by the already overburdened common people.""Asked about the logic behind the project at a time like this, an additional secretary of the housing ministry said, ""We don't do anything on our own. We only execute plans that come from the top level."""

Inspired by what he had learnt, Hossain collected six hens of three breeds before returning home in 2016.The 46-year-old now has 40 different breeds of chicken at his farm, which earns him a profit of between Tk 25,000 and Tk 30,000 per month.""I had to stop studying by the seventh semester of my diploma course on engineering due to poverty.
