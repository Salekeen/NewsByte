The documents noted that Nora Fatehi's visit to Bangladesh, for the Global Achievers Award programme, had been denied by the ministry.According to the circular, Bollywood actress Nora Fatehi could not be given permission to participate in the Global Achievers Award programme, organised by the Women's Leadership Corporation, which was supposed to be held on November 18.The circular noted that the reason why Nora had been denied permission to perform in Bangladesh, was due to the current global condition and situation surrounding the dollar crunch.However, according to the organisers, the decision is still in progress, and has not been finalised.Last month, Mirror Group asked for permission to bring the actress for a private programme, however, they were denied permission by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, for similar reasons.The president of the Women Leadership Corporation, Sharna Mria Mrittik is still hopeful that they will get the authorisation for Nora Fatehi's entrance to Bangladesh.""Our application has not been denied,"" she told The Daily Star, adding, ""The circular which was published was based on the previous application. Mirror group had initially sent a legal notice to Nora and the relevant ministries responsible for handling permissions for such situations. As a result, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs denied Nora the permission to perform at our programme. Based on that notice, our organisation's name was included. However, Mirror group have now withdrawn all the complaints, and our application is still pending.""According to Sharna, she met with the Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs—along with her lawyer—and was informed that their application is still pending. According the Secretary, the final decision will be made once the Minister of Cultural Affairs, K M Khalid, MP returns from London later this week.Sharna also shared that negative reporting by media outlets has been hampering the whole situation, creating pressure from Nora Fatehi's side as well.""The final decision will be made on Thursday, and we can only come to a conclusion then,"" said Sharna.Nora was supposed to perform in a total of three outfits—while also distributing awards at the Global Achievers Award programme. The actress had even posted a video message, sharing how she was excited to come to Bangladesh for the programme."

I am still in South Korea, at the after-party of the event. It has been exhilarating, to say the least. In 2019, I was a participant in the same event, and now I took the judge's seat – it is truly and honour. It is also very heartening to see the Bangladeshi contingent perform well here.
Who, among the Bangladeshi participants, did well?



Mir Maryam Ahmed reached the Top 10 of the 'Face of Asia' segment. Besides her, Hasnat Jami was also noticeable in the event.
Where is does the modeling industry in Bangladesh stand right now?
Despite our greatest efforts, there is a lot left to be desired in terms of events. For example, we used to have the Bangladesh Fashion week, which does not take place any more. Whatever achievements that we have in this field, it is the result of earnest efforts from a very limited number of people in this sector.



 








On that note, I would really like to thank Azra Mahmood for her constant mentorship and support for this programme.
You have achieved a lot at this young age. Do you feel like you could mentor some up-and-coming models in the future?
I cannot even think about mentoring someone, as so many seniors whom I idolize are still in their prime. I just mentioned Azra Mahmood, and there are many other talented individuals, who deserve the title of a 'mentor'. I am just happy to be able to represent Bangladesh.

Even though Ayub Bachchu had a legendary career with both LRB and as a solo artiste, he continued his never-ending journey towards making even more memorable classics.In June of 2018, The Daily Star sat down with the legendary Ayub Bachchu for what would be one of his last full-length interviews.It seems like you have added a new guitar to your already majestic collection. Tell us about it.I was just practicing with this one; it is a 'Rusty Cooley' signature guitar from Dean. Rusty Cooley is a guitarist I have grown to admire a lot in recent years. His technique is immaculate, and he is one of the fastest shredders in the world today.  Every guitar I own is like a friend of mine, and they listen to what I want to articulate through my tunes.Do you listen to music from the newer bands in the industry?
Of course. I think the kids are doing some amazing work, and I love all of them. I will not take any particular names of musicians that I like, because that will be unfair to the others who are doing so well. They will go very far if they stay humble and passionate towards their craft.
Could you tell us about some of the new music you are working on at the moment?
I will be doing some new songs that will connect to the audience like none before them. The songs will bring back the feelings one could perhaps derive from ""Cholo Bodley Jai"" or ""Keu Shukhi Noy"". I am never the one to think that I have done enough, because I know that a musician's journey is endless. And from my side, the best is yet to come.



A lot of people have complained that the access to the internet and social media has made a negative impact on music as a whole, due to the 'viral' culture that has emerged. What are your thoughts on this?
Before putting the blame on something or someone, we have to look at what we ourselves are doing. The industry will always keep changing, we have to accept that and adapt to it. When you walked in to take this interview, you saw that I was practicing music, and getting ready for the next show. A musician should not think about what is going on around him; he should just be true to himself and keep on making music that he likes. In fact, I will request all the bands in the country to never stop believing in yourself, your day will come.

Similar to ""Poran"", Razz's other movie, ""Hawa"", has also been performing well in theatres across Bangladesh. The talented actor is currently busy promoting Raihan Rafi's football-based film, ""Damal"", which will hit theatres on October 28.The audience will once again get the chance to witness Razz's crackling chemistry alongside Bidya Sinha Mim, in this film. ""Damal"" also stars Siam Ahmed, Rashed Mamun Apu, and Sumit, among many others.In a candid conversation with The Daily Star, Sariful Razz opened up about his love for football, his role in ""Damal"" and much more.It seems like football has truly become your trusty 'best friend'.  We don't see you anywhere without your football nowadays.
Honestly speaking, I don't go anywhere without my trusty football. My whole life revolves around it now, and I am always taking pictures with it.



Which international football team do you support?
I am a huge fan of Brazil and my all-time favourite player is Ronaldinho
How did you perform the iconic 'bicycle kick' in ""Damal""?



 








I had zero knowledge about how to do a bicycle kick. Thus, when the director told me that I had to perform the bicycle kick in a scene, I had major doubts about whether I would be able to execute it to perfection. I spent 3-4 months getting into the skin of my character in the film. So, I tried my best to make sure that scene was perfect, and I am really pleased with how it was shown in the trailer. The cinematographer truly captured the scene brilliantly in the film.
In the film, it feels as if football is more important than your wife? Why did it look like your wife was angry at you?

Unfortunately, in the film, my wedding date and football match fell on the same day. Time was ticking and the Kazi was taking a lot of time. So, I had to stop him in the middle by shouting 'Alhamdulillah Kobul', before running off towards the field. When I returned after the match, my wife had locked the door and refused to let me enter. To know what happens next, the audiences will have to wait till October 28.
Tell us a little bit more about 'Damal'?

""Damal"" is inspired by the Shadhin Bangla Football Team, which was formed in 1971 during the Liberation War. In the movie, I play the captain of that team. When they go to the theatres, the audience will get to see my love for football in this film.
Both your films, ""Hawa"" and ""Poran"", are still playing in theatres. ""Damal"" will also be released soon. What are your expectations from this upcoming film?
I am really happy that both my movies ""Poran"" and ""Hawa"" are doing exceptionally well at theatres. ""Damal"" will also be released next week and thus I am hopeful that the audience will shower their love on this movie as well.
