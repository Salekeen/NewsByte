YouTube states that those who have received the first mail will receive another email and a notification in YouTube Studio, after which the user can choose their own unique YouTube handle name. If your YouTube channel already has a personalised URL, YouTube will be reserving the name in that URL as the automatic handle. Users will be able to change that reserved handle if they wish. Even if your YouTube channel doesn't have a personalised URL, you can still choose a handle for your channel when the feature is released for everyone. If you already didn't have a personalised URL for your channel., YouTube will also create a personalised URL as well when you create your handle.According to YouTube, if you haven't selected a handle for your YouTube channel by November 14, 2022, you will be automatically assigned a handle.

/nrb/news/awami-league-leader-arrested-sent-jail-over-rape-us-3147996,"Awami League leader arrested, sent to jail over rape in US","A Massachusetts court in the US has arrested an Awami League leader in the US and sent him to jail on charges of raping an American black woman and strangulating her.The accused is Asif Ahmed Chowdhury aka Asif Babu (62), a resident of Medford near Boston and the vice-president of New England (Boston) Awami League. He is also former president of Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE) based in Boston, New England. He hails from Kattali village under Pahartali Police Station of Chattogram district.Judge Thomas Drechsler of the Superior Court of Salem City, Massachusetts on Friday, October 14, revoked Babu's bail on serious charges including rape and strangulation and arrested him pending sentencing before sending him to jail.Following the week-long judicial process, he was ordered to be remanded in custody. According to court sources, Asif Babu will be given the final sentence in the case on November 8.The incident of rape allegedly took place in September 2020.The victim, who has been living in the emergency shelter on Federal Street in Salem with her then 9-year-old daughter after she lost her job due to the pandemic and was unable to pay her rent, testified under questioning by prosecutor Kate MacDougall.While staying there, she searched for a place to live in Medford so her daughter could return to the school she was attending before the eviction, the woman testified, adding that she responded to an ad on Facebook Marketplace for a single room, placed by Chowdhury, and planned to take the room.Several days later, on September 17, 2020, Asif Babu visited the woman in Salem so she could sign a rental agreement. During that meeting is when the assault took place, the woman testified.The woman's daughter told jurors that she was awoken by the sounds of ""a lot of chaos"" and peeked out of the bedroom to see a man standing over her mother. ""She couldn't get up at all,"" the girl told jurors. She backed into the bedroom and called 911 emergency hotline.Salem Police Officer Jonathan Springer was the first to arrive at the shelter and found Asif Babu struggling with the woman near the door. He separated the two.Officer Keegan Stokes then arrived and spoke with the woman, who he said was crying hysterically. Stokes told jurors that he noticed that the kitchen of the shelter apartment was in disarray and found Asif Babu's glasses on the floor.Defense lawyers Syrie Fried and Benjamin Brooks sought to highlight inconsistencies in the woman's account to police, her testimony to a grand jury and her testimony at the trial, and pressed her with questions about Facebook Messenger exchanges in which Babu used heart emojis and paid her compliments.They also suggested the woman started the fight during a dispute over the amount of rent she would pay. ""You became angry and hit him,"" Fried suggested in a question. ""No,"" the woman responded.Fried showed the woman a photo of Asif Babu with scratches on his neck, and the ripped shirt he wore that night.""I was trying to get him off of me,"" the victim responded.Earlier, on November 9, 2019, during the biennial election of the Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE) in Boston, Asif Babu, a candidate for the president from one panel, and his associates beat up a candidate from a rival panel, leaving him seriously injured. When the help of the police was sought to control the situation, the police reached the spot and stopped the polling. Based on the said incident, Khoka-Nabi-Sami Parishad sports secretary candidate SM Sajjad Hossain filed a case against Asif Babu with the local police. A few weeks later, the case was settled with the intervention of some alleged community leaders in Boston.Despite allegations of widespread irregularities in that election, Asif Babu was elected president of the Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE) for a two-year term. This year, he appointed his wife Parvin Chowdhury as the president of BANE. Noman Sabit is a freelance journalist based in New York, US"
/rohingya-influx/news/no-good-news-yet-chinese-side-rohingya-repatriation-momen-3147746,No specific date when Rohingya repatriation will begin: Momen ,"Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen today (October 20, 2022) met with Chinese Ambassador Li Jiming to discuss about the Rohingya repatriation and other issues of concern between the nations. ""My key discussion (with Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh) today focused on Myanmar and the Rohingya issue,"" he told reporters after his meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming.The current Myanmar government honours all the previous agreements signed between Bangladesh and Myanmar and expressed willingness to take back the Rohingyas after verification. ""That's good news but there is no specific date (when repatriation will begin),"" Momen said.The hour-long meeting was held at the State guesthouse Padma while the Foreign Minister briefed the media at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Momen said the Chinese side is trying to help find a solution. ""They (China) are the facilitator, not the decision maker. We are requesting them again and again,"" he said, adding that the Bangladesh side is keeping them under pressure.The current Myanmar government honours all the previous agreements signed between Bangladesh and Myanmar and expressed willingness to take back the Rohingyas after verification. ""That's good news but there is no specific date (when repatriation will begin),"" Momen said.The foreign minister said the Rohingya issue is a priority for Bangladesh. ""We need a quick and sustainable resolution to the crisis.""Responding to a question, Momen said there has been no discussion on Teesta issue with the Chinese Ambassador. ""I said this issue was never raised to me.""Momen said he conveyed the Chinese Ambassador to play a role so that the Rohingyas living on zero point can be taken back inside the Myanmar side.Responding to a question, he said, ""I am always a very optimistic person.""He, however, said the situation along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border has improved which he sees as good news.Brokered by China, Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an agreement for starting repatriation of the Rohingya refugees to Myanmar under a tripartite mechanism, but the process remained stalled.The idea of a tripartite mechanism among Bangladesh, China and Myanmar came four years ago in New York to evaluate the situation on the ground and take steps for the early repatriation and there had been few meetings.Ambassador Jiming at a recent event indicated that they are going to formally share the ""feedback"" with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka based on what they talked with the Myanmar side. ""I am not going to disclose it right now.""Despite assurance from Myanmar, not a single person was taken back over the last five years. Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingya in Cox's Bazar and Bhasan Char."
/environment/natural-resources/energy/news/the-russian-problem-new-us-nuclear-power-industry-3147926,The Russian problem of new US nuclear power industry,"US firms developing a new generation of small nuclear power plants to help cut carbon emissions have a big problem: only one company sells the fuel they need, and it's Russian.That's why the US government is urgently looking to use some of its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium to help fuel the new advanced reactors and kick-start an industry it sees as crucial for countries to meet global net-zero emissions goals.""Production of HALEU is a critical mission and all efforts to increase its production are being evaluated,"" a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said.The energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine has renewed interest in nuclear power. Backers of smaller, next-generation reactors say they are more efficient, quicker to build, and could turbocharge the shift away from fossil fuels.But without a reliable source of the high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) the reactors need, developers worry they won't receive orders for their plants. And without orders, potential producers of the fuel are unlikely to get commercial supply chains up and running to replace the Russian uranium.""We understand the need for urgent action to incentivize the establishment of a sustainable, market-driven supply of HALEU,"" the DOE spokesperson said.The US government is in the final stages of evaluating how much of its inventory of 585.6 tonnes of highly enriched uranium to allocate to reactors, the spokesperson said.The fact that Russia has a monopoly on HALEU has long been a concern for Washington but the war in Ukraine has changed the game, as neither the government nor the companies developing the new advanced reactors want to rely on Moscow.HALEU is enriched to levels of up to 20%, rather than around 5% for the uranium that powers most nuclear plants. But only TENEX, which is part of Russian state-owned nuclear energy company Rosatom, sells HALEU commercially at the moment.While no Western countries have sanctioned Rosatom over Ukraine, mainly because of its importance to the global nuclear industry, US power plant developers such as X-energy and TerraPower don't want to be dependent on a Russian supply chain.""We didn't have a fuel problem until a few months ago,"" said Jeff Navin, director of external affairs at TerraPower, whose chairman is billionaire Bill Gates. ""After the invasion of Ukraine, we were not comfortable doing business with Russia.""Nuclear power currently generates about 10% of the world's electricity and many countries are now exploring new nuclear projects to improve their energy supply and energy security, as well as to help meet goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.But with large-scale projects still challenging for reasons including huge up-front costs, project delays, cost overruns and competition from cheaper energy sources such as wind, several developers have proposed so-called small modular reactors (SMR).While the SMRs on offer from companies such as EDF (EDF.PA) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) use existing technology and the same fuel as traditional reactors, nine out of 10 of the advanced reactors funded by Washington are designed to use HALEU.Proponents say these advanced plants need less frequent refuelling and are three times as efficient as traditional models. Some analysts say this means they will ultimately overtake conventional nuclear technology, though the designs have yet to be tested on a commercial scale.The average levelised cost of electricity - the price needed for advanced projects to break even - is $60 per megawatt-hour compared with $97 for conventional plants, according to data from research group the Energy Innovation Reform Project.Some analysts say the price difference might be narrower at the moment, because the smaller advanced reactors using HALEU don't yet have economies of scale from mass production.Companies in the United States and Europe have plans to produce HALEU on a commercial scale but even in the most optimistic scenarios, they say it would take at least five years from the point they decide to proceed.And this chicken and egg conundrum is complicating the smooth development of HALEU supply.""Nobody wants to order 10 reactors without a fuel source, and nobody wants to invest in a fuel source without 10 reactor orders,"" said Daniel Poneman, chief executive of US nuclear fuel supplier Centrus Energy Corp (LEU.A).For firms interested in new advanced reactors, such as Washington state's public utility Energy Northwest, fuel supplies are certainly an issue in the decision making process.""A reliable HALEU supply is one of many factors under consideration,"" the company said in an emailed statement.The US government recognised years ago that Russia's monopoly on HALEU could hamper the development of the advanced reactors it hopes will provide low-carbon energy at home and also be exported to markets in Europe and Asia.The government awarded a shared-cost contract in 2019 to Centrus, the only company outside Russia which currently has a licence to make HALEU, to build a demonstration facility.While the facility was due to start making HALEU this year, production has been put back to 2023, partly because of delays in getting hold of storage containers due to supply chain issues during the global pandemic, Centrus said.Once the facility gets up and running, it will take five years before Centrus can start producing 13 tonnes of HALEU a year. But that's only a third of the amount the DOE projects will be needed for US reactors by 2030.TerraPower, for example, said it will need 15 tonnes of HALEU for the first fuel load of its advanced reactor.Other potential HALEU producers are further behind.French state-owned uranium mining and enrichment company Orano says it could start producing HALEU in five to eight years, but will only apply for a production licence once it has customers with long-term contracts.In a response to a DOE request for information about how to establish a programme to support HALEU production, Orano said it would be down to the US government to kick-start the industry.""Orano's assessment shows that the single most important factor enabling success is the DOE guaranteeing a certain volume of demand,"" the company said in a statement on its website.European uranium enrichment company Urenco, meanwhile, says it is considering sites in the United States and Britain for HALEU production but has yet to apply for licences.For TerraPower and X-energy, which have projects planned in the U.S. states of Wyoming and Washington respectively, the clock is ticking.Washington awarded them contracts to build two demonstration rectors by 2028 and shared the costs. But without Russian fuel, that deadline will fall well before any alternative commercial suppliers would be up and running.While the 20% enrichment levels for HALEU are well below the roughly 90% level needed for weapons, companies need special licences to produce it. Additional security and certification requirements are also required for production sites, packaging and transportation of the fuel.To speed up the process and break the deadlock, the US government is looking to ""downblend"" weapons-grade highly enriched uranium sitting in its stockpile, though that will also take time.The US government said in 2016 it had downblended 7.1 tonnes between Sept. 30, 2013 and March 31, 2016. Asked this month whether the process had become any faster, the DOE said: ""Downblending rates are consistently evaluated for acceleration opportunities.""The Inflation Reduction Act US President Joe Biden signed in August contained $700 million to secure HALEU supplies from the government and a consortium partnered with the DOE for use in advanced reactors and research.In September, the White House asked Congress for another $1.5 billion in a temporary government funding bill to boost domestic supply of low enriched uranium and HALEU, to address potential difficulties in accessing Russian fuel.Lawmakers took the measure out of the bill over concerns about costs, though it remains a priority for some Biden officials, including Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.Last year, nuclear power stations in the United States imported about 14% of their uranium from Russia, along with 28% of their enrichment services, according to the US Energy Information Administration."
/tech-startup/news/amazon-faces-us-1-billion-lawsuit-uk-favouring-its-own-products-3147871,Amazon faces US $1 billion lawsuit in UK for 'favouring its own products' ,"E-commerce giant Amazon.com is facing a lawsuit in Britain for damages of up to US $1 billion over allegations that the online marketplace abused its dominant position by favouring its own products, lawyers said.Consumer rights advocate Julie Hunter plans to bring the collective action on behalf of British consumers who have made purchases on Amazon since October 2016, lawyers representing her said.The proposed case, which Amazon said was ""without merit"", would be the latest mass action against a tech giant to be filed at London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).Law firm Hausfeld, which represents Hunter, said on Thursday that Amazon has breached competition law by using a secretive and self-favouring algorithm to promote its own products through the Buy Box feature on its website.Hunter said in a statement: Far from being a recommendation based on price or quality, the Buy Box favours products sold by Amazon itself, or by retailers who pay Amazon for handling their logistics. Other sellers, however good their offers might be, are effectively shut out.An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement: This claim is without merit and were confident that will become clear through the legal process.The lawsuit is expected to be filed at the CAT by the end of this month and will have to be certified by the tribunal before it can proceed.It is being brought on an opt-out basis, meaning that any potential claimants will be included in the claim unless they choose to opt out.The case follows the announcement by Britain's antitrust watchdog in July that it is investigating Amazon over suspected breaches of competition law, including how it selects which products are placed within the Buy Box feature.Amazon has faced similar probes elsewhere, recently making an offer to the European Commission to avert possible hefty EU antitrust fines.The platform has also declined to describe its product-search system to an Australian competition regulator which has heard complaints of large marketplace platforms giving preference to in-house wares.The CAT authorised an estimated US $1.1 billion (920 million-pound) damages claim against Google in July and approved another case worth up to 1.7 billion pounds against Apple in May.The tribunal is also due to decide in January whether to give the go-ahead to a claim valued at up to 2.2 billion pounds against Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, over alleged anti-competitive behaviour.Google and Apple deny the allegations against them, according to court filings, and Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment."

Commencing their venture from 17 June, 2022, Yatai has made its mark significantly in the food scene in only three months.Upon our entrance, we were moved by the classy decor illuminating a beautiful colour combination around the place. They had a mini book-shelf, a live kitchen and an angelic wall (literally). Overall, the premises looked cosy but conventional at the same time; enumerating a picturesque view for both formal office lunches or just a casual hang out with friends.""The initial response really surprised us. We were optimistic but did not expect such overwhelmingly positive feedback; that too, without involving influencer marketing or anything of that sort. I guess that is because satisfying quality and customer service is what everyone seeks at the end of the day, it is the best form of marketing,"" shared Tanjir Rahman Arnob, the owner of the restaurant.Arnob is an MBA graduate from North South University who began his journey with Yatai (a word for shop stand in Japanese) in Rajshahi. He chose the distant area of Rajshahi instead of the bustling Dhaka city then, as he identified the market gap for many job holders who reside there but are not accommodated with the right place to dine in. Over time, Yatai emerged victorious there and finally made itself a new home in the capital.Our feast began with the serving of colourful Maki Rolls as appetizers: Volcano, California, Fried Prawns, Chicken Teriyaki and much more — all prepared in front of our eyes in the live kitchen. The rolls tasted delish, given that the chefs tried to incorporate a hint of local taste in the dish; delivering a perfect blend of spices, sweet and savoury. Next was the tummy-filling Classic Bento Box — consisting of all items that a bento usually offers. Starting from rice, chicken nanban, tempuras, katsu chicken, etc. accompanied by flavourful honey mustard and soya sauce — all arranged together. Although the tempuras seemed a little under-fried as per our taste, the other items provided in the bento box were top notch; both in times of quality and quantity. Also, the menu exhibited other varieties of soup, dumplings and bento boxes too:  seafood, supreme and Yatai special that we have plans of endeavouring in our next visits. ""I realized the Bangladeshi youth is versatile. They will try to adapt to anything new that we offer them at affordable prices,"" added Arnob.Next, the bill came in with the pre-ordered seasonal fresh fruit juices, energizing our bloated tummies to a great extent. Indeed, what Arnob said was true. The youth is actually happy to try new food at reasonable prices, as the total bill amounted to around Tk 1800-2000 for a fulfilling meal for two, including palatable sushi items (which are usually so pricey elsewhere in the capital).Finally, as we were done with our shares of the aesthetic photo session, we stood up to leave. Just then, a voice echoed behind our backs.""Ma'am, please wait. Here's a complimentary dessert for you! A gesture for our loyal customers, as we hope for you to be.""We felt like happy children on cloud nine as we devoured the creamy, smoking brownie topped with vanilla ice-cream as a finish to our amazing experience at Yatai."

/shout/news/experiencing-architecture-around-us-3147426,Experiencing architecture around us,"A space is more than a vicinity that shelters us. It morphs our emotions, helps our thoughts take shape, carves out a pathway to meet like-minded people, and creates communities. We spend a large fraction of our lives indoors, which impacts us in ways we don't even realise. Such is the pedigree of a discipline that is forged by culture and society. The application of architecture isn't merely to keep track of our physical footprints, it is a practice that is also meant to address our needs. By building on existing values and having them interweave with the contemporary, architecture, in turn, also shapes culture and society.Whether to represent royalty, protect from harsh climates, or spark awe, architecture has always been emblematic of its time, location, and climate. Igloos are built with ice due to their low thermal conductivity and accessibility in the region. Japanese and Chinese architectural identities overlap due to their connection to Buddhism. The Taj Mahal utilises concepts of symmetry as well as rational and strict geometry to perpetuate the notion that Mughal leadership is flawless. A closer look at Dhaka and the parallels between the city and the livelihood of its people float to the surface. An urban jungle, lined with grey cement blocks as far as the eye can see. No corner is spared. Does it all stand to represent that people are trying to just get by? As morbid as this outlook might be, I am certain I am not the only one who bears it.Nuren Iftekhar, a Dhaka University graduate currently working as a teacher abroad, shares his views. ""Dhaka often feels like a canvas that different artists tried to paint on at the same time. A canvas that then got painted over by an amateur mason,"" he says. ""Functionality has far outpaced the sense of beauty or cohesion. A walk through my area only shows apartments whose sole purpose is to hold as many people as the zoning board approves. Wide stretched balconies have been replaced by tiny alcoves with the sole purpose of drying clothes.""Rashed H. Chowdhury, the principal architect at Dehsarworks, highlights the significance of architecture on the zeitgeist. ""A built environment is the result of all our collective effort and thoughts. While architects are the ones designing the spaces, they are responding to the needs of society. The projects also affect our conscious minds. The cause and effect go hand-in-hand.""""The primary identifier of any nation is its architectural landmarks, and I believe it is a visible envelope of our society,"" he said.A building, even with its ornamental exterior and grand scale, is only as good as the amenities of the interior. If the space inside fails to fulfil its function, then by no means does it qualify as good design. By carefully curating the right forms, colours, shapes, light, and proportions, designers can influence how an occupant might feel.""If anyone is stuck in a room that isn't exposed to natural light, has the same temperature throughout the day, and boasts no tangible change in the interior, it creates fatigue amongst its occupants,"" asserts Rashed.Iftekhar recalls what stood out to him about the design of Curzon Hall, where he attended classes in university. ""Perhaps the most noticeable aspect of Curzon hall was the uniformity. From the old halls to the newly established buildings, it is present everywhere. Even the Zoology building, with its separate colour scheme, felt like an extension of the original architectural vision. Any deviation from it feels jarring which is evident in the newer buildings. Despite having better accommodation, they never evoked the same feeling that Curzon hall did,"" he said.   Subah Shaheen, Manager at Robi Axiata Limited, discusses the use of symbolism in her workplace, ""Our workplace has a great interior. There are words and icons dispersed throughout the walls on each floor, representing the core values, visions and objectives of the company. This not only reinforces what we hear in meetings and townhalls but is a constant reminder throughout the day about what we are trying to achieve and why.""There is evidence that using certain elements in the interior will evoke a specific kind of ambience and mood. Furthermore, a building serves a wide variety of needs of many different people. Even then, the space must serve more than one purpose for each individual Therefore, it really isn't feasible to predict how one might respond to their environment.Iftekhar comments on how the architecture of Dhaka University and Curzon Hall makes him feel. ""The first thing that Curzon hall evoked in my mind as I first stepped foot there as a freshman was grandeur. As cliched as it sounds, the wide hallway, the old arches and the red bricks gave it a sense of timelessness.""""Having a common space in every floor creates an opportunity for social interaction within the office. The space enables employees to have important discussions, enjoy a game of foosball, and does wonders to help relax during the day. It also helps us save time as you don't have to get out of the office to unwind,"" said Subah about her workplace.New spaces must be designed to meet various needs. However, what appears to have taken precedence are economic benefits. Allowing capitalistic interests to dictate urban planning causes efficiency to trump empathy for the people. In the process, citizens are left stuck with a lack of open spaces, poorly designed footpaths, and a monotonous cityscape. Urban planners and policymakers must instil changes that account for the welfare of the people.In a write-up for The Grudging Urbanist titled ""There is just one way to save Dhaka"", Adnan Zillur Morshed, renowned architect, architectural historian, and urbanist, attributed the capital's rampant traffic crisis to a lack of land-use planning. ""We allowed the city to become an untenable urban juggernaut, an infernal urban agglomeration, paying little attention to how the city's land could be developed with a logical sequence of use and zoning,"" he says.He urges that Dhaka undertake land-use planning – a system that opts for areas to facilitate schools, grocery shops, malls and other venues for recreation within walking distance of the residents. As a result, it will eliminate the need to travel long distances and reduce congestion within the city.""I think what can really help the capital embrace openness is to first improve public transport. Discouraging the use of personal vehicles and harbouring collective commute is vital. It bunches people up and frees up space. The prospect of being a part of a community should be cherished and design should enable that. The fabric of the city should be people-centric,"" remarked Rashed.Nonetheless, what plagues much of Dhaka is the invasion of open spaces. Footpaths are occupied, fields are a parading ground for local politicians, seasonal melas, or construction sites, and due to the steep climb in the rate of urbanisation, water bodies are at risk because of housing accommodations.While it will generate employment in the tertiary sector, create new forms of income, and help the economy, this approach is myopic. Natural resources are compromised and historical landmarks are destroyed all for the sake of ""development"". What gets overlooked, as a result, are other problems that will have to be tackled in the future. If the correct measures are not taken now, the benefits of the present will merely be consolation.An architect can let all the principles of design guide them but a design that is not centred around people is a design that will inevitably fail. Spaces are social spheres, grounds for igniting important conversations and inspiring change. A city that breeds unhappiness is a place that is waiting to fall apart. To nourish it is to let its inhabitants thrive. It is time we let consciousness spearhead architecture and design.   Rashed Chowdhury is hopeful about the future of architecture. He believes what allows it to thrive and makes it a promising field is the vastness, scope of innovation, geopolitical nature of Bangladesh and the spirit of youth.""Unlike anywhere else in the world, Bangladeshi architecture incorporates a lot of diversity. Due to the reform having grey area, we are allowed to venture out and explore,"" he concludes.Abir Hossain is a sub-editor at SHOUT, The Daily Star. Reach him at abir.hossain@thedailystar.net

/opinion/project-syndicate/news/wars-arent-won-peacetime-economies-3147846,Wars aren’t won with peacetime economies,"Politically, the G7 and like-minded countries around the world have adopted a war footing to stop Russian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin violated the most fundamental principle of international law by launching an attack on another member of the United Nations – an institution created explicitly to prevent such aggression. The dangers of appeasement should be obvious. Even a little empathy should make us shudder in horror at the prospect of having to live under Putin's rule. It is a peculiar war. While Putin has described his project as a confrontation with the entire West, Ukrainians alone are doing all the fighting and bearing the full brunt of Russian attacks. Meanwhile, Europe and America have provided economic and military assistance, and the rest of the world has been dealing with the war's fallout, including higher energy and food prices.But it is a mistake to think that the war can be won with a peacetime economy. No country has ever prevailed in a serious war by leaving markets alone. Markets simply move too slowly for the kind of major structural changes that are required. Wars inevitably cause shortages and generate windfall gains for some at the expense of others. Historically, war profiteers have typically been executed. But today, they include many energy producers and traders who, rather than being marched to the gallows, should be subjected to a windfall profits tax. The European Union has proposed such a measure, but it would come too late, and it is too weak and too narrow for the challenge at hand. Similarly, while several members of the US Congress have put forward bills to tax Big Oil's superprofits, the Biden administration has so far failed to move on the issue. That is understandable, given that US President Joe Biden has been busy enlisting support for signal achievements like the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. Moreover, in seeking the private sector's cooperation in limiting price increases, he has been at pains not to appear ""anti-business."" But taxing windfall profits and using the proceeds to finance the necessary war spending and support for those hurt by high prices is not anti-business; it is responsible wartime governance, which is necessary to maintain popular support for the war effort. Even more comprehensive measures are needed in Europe, where today's electricity market was not designed to deal with wartime conditions. Instead, it follows the principle of marginal-cost pricing. That means the electricity price reflects the highest-cost source of production needed to meet current demand. As fuel prices have soared, marginal costs have risen far above average costs. The cost of renewable energy has, for instance, changed little. As such, many sellers of low-cost electricity are making a killing, as are the traders who bought energy at the lower pre-war prices. While these market players reap billions of euros in profits, consumers' electricity bills are soaring. Electricity prices in energy-rich Norway, with its enormous gas and oil reserves and hydro capacity, have increased nearly tenfold. Meanwhile, households and small businesses are being pushed to the brink, and even some big companies have already gone bankrupt. The European principle of ""no state aid"" has been thrown aside, mainly because European leaders moved too slowly in changing a market structure that was not designed for war. Economists love marginal-cost pricing because it provides appropriate incentives, and because its distributive consequences tend to be small and easily manageable in normal times. But now, the system's incentive effects are small and its distributive effects are enormous. In the short run, consumers and small businesses will have to turn down their thermostat in the winter and turn it up in the summer, but comprehensive energy-saving investments take time to plan and implement. Fortunately, there is a simpler system that would retain most of marginal-cost pricing's incentive effects without the distributive effects. Under a non-linear pricing framework, households and firms could be allowed to purchase 90 percent of their previous year's supply at the previous year's price, and 91-110 percent of supply at, say, 150 percent of the previous year's price, before the marginal-cost price kicks in. While non-linear pricing can't be used in many markets – owing to the possibility of ""arbitrage"" (buying a good at a low price and immediately reselling it at a much higher price) – electricity is not one of them. That is why some economists have long advocated its use in cases where large market failures are having important distributive effects. It is a powerful tool that governments can and should use, especially when confronting wartime conditions. Such changes have become imperative. As the Vietnamese understood, wars are won as much on the political front as on the battlefield. The purpose of the 1968 Tet Offensive was not to gain territory but to change the political calculus of the war, and it worked. Defeating Russia obviously will require more help for Ukraine. But it will also require a better economic response on the part of the West more broadly. That starts with sharing more of the burden through windfall profit taxes, controlling key prices – such as those for electricity and food – and encouraging government interventions where necessary to alleviate critical shortages. Neoliberalism, based on simplistic ideas about how markets should operate that fail to comprehend how they actually operate, didn't work even in peacetime. It must not be allowed to stop us from winning this war. Joseph E Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics, is professor at Columbia University and a member of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation."
