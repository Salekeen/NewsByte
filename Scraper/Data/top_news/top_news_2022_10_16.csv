/entertainment/tv-film/news/moshari-chilling-narrative-the-reality-women-3144291,‘Moshari’: A chilling narrative on the reality of women,"Spoilers AheadOn Saturday, Nuhash Humayun's horror-short, ""Moshari"", was released worldwide on Vimeo. The movie won multiple awards at the Atlanta Film Festival, Bucheon International Film Festival, Melbourne International Film Festival and Woodstock Film Festival.It was neither the uneasy ambience of shadows and flickering lights, nor the eerie background score that struck me while watching Nuhash Humayun's ""Moshari"". Rather, the hardest blow was realising that the reason I caught onto the underlying representation from the get go was simply because I was a woman—watching the very reality of my existence through a work of horror-fiction.""Moshari"" follows the story of two sisters in a post-apocalyptic world, where bloodthirsty creatures referred to as vampires, haunt the earth after daylight disappears. To stay safe from these creatures that arrive at the slightest scent of blood, one must stay inside a moshari (mosquito net) until the sun comes up. It all seemed like a standard setup for a dystopian world until a particular detail caught my attention.Early on in the film, there is a public announcement that even the first world countries have fallen against these monsters, but Bangladesh is still doing well against them—as most of the population is shown abiding by the regulations.The fact that the male voice behind the announcement takes a particular pride in making this announcement, while also urging everyone to hurriedly coop up inside their moshari before sundown, and that the protagonists are a girl and a young woman seen doing exactly that, immediately rings a bell.""Moshari"" is a chilling commentary about our patriarchal society, that sees it fit to violate women however possible, unless they stay inside like prisoners in their own space and 'cover up'. The monsters themselves are none other than the men, sick with the plague of misogyny, who don't even spare children from their vile actions.The 22-minutes-long film delivers as much in visual metaphors, as it does in symbolic dialogues. Young Ayra's (Nairah Onora Saif) unwillingness to escape to safety as soon as it's dark like everybody else, her curiosity and rebellious nature unveils the heart-breaking unfairness and oppression women undergo.The scene where Ayra sternly tells the monster that he cannot invade her hiding spot, while being unable to breathe because of his presence, is a stark parallel to the violation of personal space and bodily autonomy women face on a daily basis.At first it may seem odd that Sunehra Binte Kamal, who plays Ayra's elder sister, is referred to only as ""Apu"" throughout the entire duration. We never learn so much as her name. However, why would we, as she perishes in the end anyway?After all, our society and system strips down a woman's identity in order to tag her as a mere victim when she falls prey to their own collective failure. Yet another applaudable aspect of ""Moshari"" is that instead of overdoing ostentatious jump-scares, the monsters are shown lurking in the shadows in multiple shots, mostly in frame, in a somewhat intimate normalcy. This strongly establishes how the people they represent are everywhere around us, more often than not inside our own homes.

/middle-east/news/iran-prison-fire-4-killed-61-injured-protests-continue-3144311,"Iran prison fire: 4 killed, 61 injured as protests continue","A fire at Iran's Evin prison late on Saturday killed four detainees and injured 61, state media reported, as anti-government protests sparked by a woman's death in police custody continued on Sunday, including at several universities.Iranian authorities said on Saturday that a prison workshop had been set on fire ""after a fight among a number of prisoners convicted of financial crimes and theft"". Evin holds many detainees facing security charges, including Iranians with dual nationality.Iran's judiciary said four of those injured in Saturday's fire were in critical condition and that those killed had died of smoke inhalation, Iranian state media reported.Earlier state television aired video apparently showing that calm had returned to the facility.The protests sparked by 22-year-old Mahsa Amini's death while in the custody of Iran's morality police on Sept. 16 have turned into one of the boldest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 revolution, and have been met with a brutal state crackdown.Rights groups say at least 240 protesters have been killed, including 32 minors. The authorities have not published a death toll.Protests continued at several universities on Sunday, including in the cities of Tabriz and Rasht, to a heavy deployment of riot police. Videos posted on social media showed students at a Tehran university chanting: ""Iran has turned into a big prison. Evin prison has become a slaughterhouse.""Reuters could not independently verify the footage.Families of some political detainees at Evin prison took to social media to call on the authorities to ensure their safety, which in 2018 was blacklisted by the U.S. government for ""serious human rights abuses"".Footage of the prison aired on state television hours later showed firefighters inspecting a workshop with fire damage to the roof. It also showed inmates asleep in their wards.Atena Daemi, a human rights activist, said that relatives of prisoners held in the women's section had gathered at the prison for routine visiting hours, but that the authorities had denied them access, resulting in a standoff.The relatives were told that the prisoners were ""fine, but the phones are broken"", according to Daemi. However, she later tweeted that some women prisoners had called their families briefly.A lawyer representing an American Iranian held at Evin, Siamak Namazi, imprisoned for nearly seven years on espionage-related charges rejected by Washington as baseless, said on Sunday that Namazi had contacted his relatives.Several other dual national Iranians and foreign citizens are held in Evin prison mostly for security-related charges.""I am pleased to report that #SiamakNamazi has now spoken to his family. He is safe and has been moved to a secure area of Evin Prison. We have no further details at this time,"" Jared Genser said in a tweet.The husband of Iranian journalist Niloofar Hamedi, who broke the news of Amini's death and was arrested last month, also wrote on Twitter that she had telephoned him on Sunday.VIOLENT CRACKDOWNAsked about the prison fire, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters during a campaign trip on Saturday to Portland, Oregon that the Iranian government was ""so oppressive"" and that he was surprised by the courage of the Iranian protesters.Iran's foreign ministry said Biden had interfered in state matters by showing support for the anti-government protests.Rights groups said at least 240 protesters had been killed in the anti-government protests, including 32 minors. Over 8,000 people had been arrested in 111 cities and towns, Iranian activist news agency HRANA said on Saturday.Among the casualties have been teenage girls whose deaths have become a rallying cry for more demonstrations across the country.Iran, which has blamed the violence on enemies at home and abroad, deny security forces have killed protesters. State media said on Saturday at least 26 members of the security forces had been killed by ""rioters"".The protests have attracted international condemnation, with the United States, Canada and some European countries imposing sanctions on Iranian officials and organisations they accuse of being involved in the clampdown on protesters.""On Saturday ... Biden interfered in Iran's state matters by supporting the riots ... In recent days, the U.S. administration has tried desperately to inflame unrest in Iran under various excuses,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said, Iran's state media reported.The protests mark one of the boldest challenges to clerical rule since the 1979 revolution, with demonstrations spreading across the country and widespread calls for the downfall the Islamic Republic, even if the unrest does not seem close to toppling the system."
/entertainment/tv-film/news/rubeus-hagrid-remembering-the-gentle-giant-who-stole-our-hearts-3144246,Rubeus Hagrid: Remembering the gentle giant who stole our hearts,"My first exposure to the Harry Potter series was through the movies, eventually leading to me reading the books. Since then, I've been eagerly waiting for my letter from Hogwarts.Even with all the magical adventures, classes, quidditch matches, broomsticks, and wands, one character that really stood out for me was the half-giant, half-wizard Hagrid.The night Harry discovers he's a wizard is almost portrayed like a horror film in the first Harry Potter movie. To avoid the letters warning him of his magic, his uncle takes Harry, along with the rest of the obnoxious Dursleys to a cabin on a distant island.Nevertheless, Hagrid shows up in person to deliver Harry's letter to Hogwarts, busting down the door after the Dursleys refuse to let him in. Even though his initial silhouette frightens everyone including Harry, as soon as he speaks, Harry realises that Hagrid is a friendly visitor and not a terrifying monster.The Scottish actor, Robbie Coltrane, the man behind the loveable giant passed away on Friday at the age of 72. For a generation of Potterheads, Coltrane was best known for his eight-film-run as Hagrid. The character, as he appeared in the book, was a bumbling, whimsical, and devoted ally to Harry and his friends.Coltrane, who was already six-feet-tall, had to wear a padded jacket and use extremely small props and sets to get into the character of the giant and really tower over his co-stars. However, being Hagrid was more than just a physical challenge for the actor. Over the course of a decade, Coltrane gave the character a depth and humanity that helped him become not just instantly recognisable, but also real. And he did all of this while gently resisting the script's tendency to make the character into one used for comic relief.In an interview, Coltrane revealed that he had read the books to his children, which is how he came to know and adore them. ""If you're an actor, you have to do the voices. The children expect it. No monotones allowed,"" he had joked.In the books, Hagrid was a peculiar adult, who fit in more with Harry and his friends—who would frequently visit him for tea and conversations—which is somewhat ironic given that he is a giant. Hagrid was the groundskeeper of Hogwarts, after being expelled from the magical school as a young man, resulting in him being somewhat childish. He's the kind of eccentric personality who names a submissive bloodhound ""Fang"", while naming a fearsome three-headed dog ""Fluffy"".However, his love for animals and magical creatures is truly what makes him the 'gentle giant', as he can be seen caring for man-eating spiders and dangerous dragons with the utmost care.The movies stayed mostly true to Hagrid's narrative, but they frequently made fun of and gawked at his character. In the first film, Hagrid gives Harry a birthday cake, with the icing misspelled as 'Happee Birthdae', a needless insult to his intelligence given that it was never done in the books. In the fourth movie, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", Hagrid accidentally stabs a co-worker in the hand with a fork due to his attraction to a romantic interest, this pretty severe example of his ungainliness wasn't in the text either. Characters frequently gave Hagrid the silent treatment when he spoke, rolling their eyes or making faces at him as if he were stupid, all of which feels rather unfair.Coltrane, however, avoided adopting a caricature-like approach when portraying Hagrid. Instead, he used the character's backstory—like that fact that he was tormented by his Hogwarts peers, abandoned by his giantess mother, and desperately trying to hide his genetic heritage—to help audiences connect with Hagrid.Even at his most ridiculous moments, Hagrid had a hopefulness and a tenderness that portrayed the character's difficult past. The actor seemed to comprehend Hagrid's struggles that gave him a fortitude that didn't turn into bitterness, but rather into a genuine capacity to accept characters like Harry, Ron, and Hermione—those who also struggled to fit in with the rest of the school.Consider the scene where Hagrid introduces the trio to his half-brother, the enormous Grawp. The dialogue calls for Hagrid to be emphatic about their assistance, as he needs the trio to keep Grawp company while he's away. He explains, ""He's completely harmless, just like I said,"" he explains, ""though high-spirited is all… You will look after him, won't you?""Coltrane spoke these words softly rather than firmly—almost fighting back tears—helping the audience understand that Hagrid is feeling guilty and desperate about the request.Aside from the second movie, Hagrid was rarely the centre of attention, but his sympathy for the heroes kept the story's heart alive, and Coltrane saw the potential in his character right away. In an interview for the franchise's 20th-anniversary special, the actor compared Hagrid to Superman.""Everybody in the world would like a really big, huge, strong, good man on their side, simple as that. That's the attraction of Superman and these things,"" he said. ""You wish there were a power for good in the world that was irresistible to the bad guys. And Hagrid was always obviously the good guy, wasn't he?""An emotional Coltrane also said in that special, ""The legacy of the movies is that my children's generation will show them to their children. So, you could be watching it in 50 years' time, easy. I'll not be here, sadly, but Hagrid will, yes.""Even though Coltrane is no more, his iconic role of Hagrid will live on in the films. Even those who read the book, and have also seen the films, will usually visualise the Scottish actor when thinking about the gentle giant."

/opinion/views/news/why-are-political-parties-trying-woo-the-prince-calcutta-3144191,Why are political parties trying to woo the Prince of Calcutta?,"When former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly exits as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) after a three-year tenure leaving behind a mixed track record, the last thing one should expect is that he will cease to be in media focus. No. That is just not going to happen. And Sourav himself has made that amply clear.Between October 13 and 15, the 50-year-old former cricketer made two remarks which are a clear pointer to his future plans. First, he said not remaining BCCI chief is not the end of the road for him and secondly, he said he would contest for the post of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president. As BCCI president, he had the entire country's cricket administration and interaction with international cricket organisations as his mandate. As CAB president, his area of activities will be much smaller but familiar because he had held that post for four years earlier.Sourav's stints as cricket administrator in Bengal and BCCI have ensured he remains in the media focus and consequently the public domain. And controversies and media speculations have only added spices to that. The media in India has come up with all sorts of theories without any authenticity as it groped in the dark to understand why Sourav did not get an extension as BCCI chief. But none asked the question: is there a sense of entitlement in either getting or not getting an extension?Sourav's stint as an administrator has had its own share of setbacks – uncertainty over the Indian Premier League (IPL) due to Covid-19, lack of firming up of India's domestic cricket structure and departure of a few sulking players from Bengal to other states including wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha looking for greener pastures.On and off the field, Sourav always had a set of admirers as a player and cricket administrator. But as an administrator, he also has his critics. Some of his former colleagues in the national team rate him highly for grooming and backing them to the hilt even in the toughest phases of their cricketing careers.In normal course, Sourav's exit would have passed off as a routine event. But what has made it non-routine is the questions why he did not get a second shot as BCCI president after his first tenure came to an end even though there was no legal bar. What had raised the expectations of Sourav supporters was that in September this year, the Supreme Court allowed a person to have two consecutive tenures as president and secretary, overturning to a considerable extent the 2018 recommendations of a judicial commission. Ironically, many had thought the apex court ruling would facilitate a fresh stint of Sourav as BCCI president.The question agitating a section of the pro-Sourav media as well as the public is while he did not get an extension, BCCI Secretary Jay Shah, son of senior BJP leader and Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, got it. The comparison would not have found traction had it been anyone other than Jay. This has not only polarised the Indian media but also entered the political minefield in West Bengal where the BJP has been accused by ruling Trinamool Congress and opposition Congress and CPI(M) of ""humiliating"" the popular ""Prince of Calcutta"". The common refrain of TMC, Congress and CPI(M) is that the BJP is cut up with Sourav after failing to make him join the saffron party. TMC spokesman Kunal Ghosh claimed that it is an example of ""political vendetta"" that Amit Shah's son would continue as BCCI secretary, but not Sourav as its president.However, Ghosh was evasive when asked about his comments on Sourav hosting Amit Shah and other BJP leaders to a dinner at his south Kolkata residence in May this year. That event had no doubt left TMC squirming for a response.Sourav, for his part, has so far done a delicate balancing act when it comes to politics. If he hosted Shah to a dinner, the very next day he also shared dais with TMC leaders, including Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Mayor Firhad Hakim, at separate public events. He has so far refrained from joining any political party. Now that he is going to be out of the BCCI, will he exercise his political options? When Sourav had become CAB president for the first time in September 2015 following the death of Jagmohan Dalmiya, it was thought he had the backing of Mamata who however went on record to reject any suggestion of interference in a sporting body. It remains to be seen how the coming CAB presidential race pans out.The question is: why would political parties fall over each other to woo Sourav who has no standing as a political heavyweight and is not known for articulation or giving fiery speeches. Given his popularity as a cricketer, Sourav's only value addition could be to the electoral plank of Bengali sub-nationalism which TMC had used so successfully in 2021. It is a different matter that TMC had later tried to live down a bit of that sub-nationalism post-Bengal assembly poll by inducting a number of non-Bengali politicians from other states as it had unsuccessfully tried to be a national party by contesting assembly elections in Goa, and prior to that, in Tripura municipal polls. It certainly did not help TMC which put up a disastrous show in Goa and Tripura.True, Mamata herself is TMC's biggest vote-catcher in Bengal. But the party has built up a formidable grassroot machinery and mobilisation across the state, which BJP cannot match. On the other hand, BJP's main electoral mascot is Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is in this perspective that one has to see Sourav's relevance in Bengal politics and how much value addition he can bring to any party he decides to join. For BJP, the induction of Sourav cannot make up for its lack of adequate ground-level presence in Bengal to counter TMC. Sourav must carefully assess his political relevance, if any.Pallab Bhattacharya is a special correspondent for The Daily Star. He writes from New Delhi, India."
/opinion/views/news/the-ecs-main-job-conduct-elections-not-suspend-them-3144266,"The EC’s main job is to conduct elections, not suspend them","For its latest feat, our Election Commission (EC) deserves to be commended on a number of counts. First, for perhaps the first time in Bangladesh's history, the EC stepped up and halted the by-election to Gaibandha-5 constituency amid widespread irregularities. Second, the commission seems to have finally realised its constitutional obligation of ensuring free and fair elections. Finally, it has also exercised its power – power to suspend an ongoing election, to dismiss the results of an election, and to decide that a re-election is required.The EC has provided its justification for why the Gaibandha-5 by-poll was suspended, while the ruling party claims that the EC is biased and that the election was conducted in a free and fair manner.The EC has, in the past, always been indifferent to accusations of electoral irregularities and has always declared elections to have been conducted fairly. However, this time around, the commission has been curiously diligent about ensuring that all polling stations are monitored via CCTV cameras. Whether there are any connections between the EC's determination to prove it is going to ensure corruption-free elections and the ruling party's vehemence in proving the EC is partial against them remains to be seen.However, conversations over the last few days have given way to some crucial questions. Why is the EC so hell-bent on trying to convince us that election irregularities only occur due to law enforcers not fulfilling their duty, while also trying to establish the ""legitimacy"" of electronic voting machines (EVMs)? Why are CCTV cameras being posed as the only solution to ensuring free and fair elections?One of the main reasons for a lack of public trust towards the EC is how adamant the commission has been about using EVMs in elections. It was in late August that the EC declared its decision to use EVMs in up to 150 parliamentary seats in the next general election. And this was done despite major opposition political parties' clear expression of distrust towards the voting machines. It has been widely discussed by opposition party politicians, political experts, and members of the public how fickle a machine an EVM is and how it can easily be manipulated by the EC itself and by those whom the commission has recruited to oversee polling stations. But the EC has paid no heed to these concerns. It has, in turn, only said that EVMs cannot be manipulated by any ""outside"" entities. But the concern that EVMs could be manipulated by presiding officers (PO), besides the fact that the machines are also prone to not recognising the biometric fingerprints of voters, have consistently been dismissed by the EC. Who is to say that the PO who can unlock an EVM using their fingerprint cannot also manipulate the votes? Moreover, there is no Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) when it comes to EVMs. And even if the voting is done digitally, the votes across polling stations and centres will still be accumulated manually.Instead of constructively addressing each of these concerns, the EC has decided to create an ""invisible,"" outside enemy when it is the commission itself whose role in the use of EVMs the people are worried about.The events of the Gaibandha-5 by-poll carry some lessons for us all. This was only a by-poll, wherein a transfer of power is not much of an issue. But even here, a section of people belonging to the ruling party have tried to manipulate the results of the election, even going so far as entering voting booths. So what happens in a year or so, when the parliamentary election will be held, and there will be 300 constituencies across the country to keep safe from such influence and manipulation? Given that it would be the biggest-scale election the country would have, it is only realistic to expect attempts of tampering with its outcome. How will the EC prevent this from happening? Is it trying to imply that it can prevent irregularities by simply installing thousands of CCTV cameras across all the booths in the country? Will they be diligently monitoring all those thousands of voting booths at all times? Is this not highly unrealistic?Bangladesh has so far had 11 general elections, four of which were conducted under an impartial caretaker government and were also largely acceptable to observers here and abroad. And the parties elected during those four elections were also ousted. The remaining seven elections were conducted under ruling parties, two of which were one-sided. Those two cannot really be considered elections at all. An election can never be without contest or competition. The rest of the five elections did not see the existing ruling party be ousted from power and were therefore wrapped in controversy.The Gaibandha-5 by-poll is no outlier, as our own election history tells us that elections conducted under ruling parties can never be free and fair, and are always met with scrutiny.In order to make the next general election an acceptable one, the EC must evolve beyond the use of CCTV cameras. It must be acknowledged that EVMs can be tampered with by those overseeing the polling centres themselves.While it would be difficult for the Election Commission to fulfil its constitutional mandate of ensuring impartial elections, it must exercise its power to suspend elections mired in controversy due to corrupt law enforcers and administrative workers. Now is the time for the EC to emphasise for all parties, especially the ruling party, to help it to conduct free and fair elections. Whether the EC can duly punish the law enforcers, influentials, and other workers who caused irregularities during the Gaibandha-5 by-poll will serve as a crucial test for them.Transcribed and translated by Afia Jahin.

Rifat died at Barishal Medical College Hospital later that day.A video clip of the barbaric attack, believed to be captured on a mobile phone, went viral on social media and triggered public outrage, with many condemning bystanders for not coming forward to save Rifat.Minni, who was seen in the video clip screaming while desperately trying to stop the two men from attacking her husband with sharp weapons, was made the first witness in the case.Citing the bail petition of Minni, her lawyer Jamiul Hoque Faisal told The Daily Star that they have examined the trial court verdict of Rifat Sharif murder case and found that there are some errors in the verdict.The HC is yet to fix any date for hearing the bail petition, he added.    On November 4, 2020, the HC admitted for hearing the appeal filed by Ayesha Siddika Minni challenging the Barguna court verdict that convicted and sentenced her to death in the sensational murder case.The HC also stayed the trial court order that fined her Tk 50,000 in the case.A Barguna court on September 30, 2020 sentenced six people including Minni to death in Rifat Sharif murder case. "

/opinion/views/news/can-indias-oldest-party-reinvent-itself-3144236,Can India’s Oldest Party Reinvent Itself?,"This month, for the first time in nearly 25 years, the Indian National Congress, India's main opposition party, will elect a president who is not a member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The family, whose history is inextricably linked to India's ""grand old party,"" has decided not to enter the leadership race, thus providing Congress a unique opportunity to revitalise itself ahead of the crucial 2024 general election.I am one of the two candidates, along with Congress veteran Mallikarjun Kharge.The Nehru-Gandhi family's decision to step aside, together with the potential implications for the 2024 election, has revived public interest in Congress. It has also provided a welcome distraction from the party's infighting and latest electoral defeats. As the 9,000 party delegates cast their ballots, former Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is leading marches from Kanyakumari to Kashmir as part of the party's 150-day ""national unity march"" (Bharat Jodo Yatra).The 136-year-old Congress has a storied history, but it finds itself at a crossroads following several successive election defeats at the national and state levels. True, the party has bounced back from similar setbacks, such as the electoral routs of 1977, 1989, and 1996. The tragic assassinations of leaders Indira Gandhi in 1984 and Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 were immediately followed by general-election victories. But the 2019 general election loss and Rahul Gandhi's subsequent resignation as party president have resulted in a three-year-long leadership crisis.How can Congress overcome its current challenges? In addition to electing a new president, it should hold elections for the Congress Working Committee, the party's principal executive body. Allowing the party's rank-and-file members to choose who will lead this powerful body would help legitimise the party's incoming leaders, giving them a clear mandate for a much-needed renewal.A new leadership would also galvanise voters. After the members of the UK Conservative Party picked Boris Johnson to succeed Theresa May as party leader and prime minister in 2019, for example, the Tories won their biggest parliamentary majority since 1987.Whatever the outcome of the current contest for Congress leadership, I believe it can revive the party and contribute to the defence of Indian democracy. While the party's presidential election is an internal exercise, it also offers Congress a chance to energise its political base and generate wider public interest.The Gandhi family's decision to step aside is the key to this potential renewal. Two candidates putting forward their visions for the party and the nation, and submitting themselves to a democratic vote, ends the talk of ""dynasty politics."" Moreover, it highlights the fact that no other Indian political party has a comparable process to determine its future leadership. By adhering to its constitution, Congress may inspire other political parties to step into the sunlight of internal democracy.But for Congress to return to power, the party's new elected leader will have to find a way to increase the party's appeal beyond its die-hard supporters. The party received only 19 percent of the vote in the 2014 and 2019 general elections, losing voters to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). To win them back, Congress requires youthful energy and fresh ideas that can challenge the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-chauvinist ideology. This requires a party leader who understands the aspirations of young Indians and firmly believes that Congress can put the country on a better path.To help India seize the opportunities the 21st century offers, Congress must articulate a positive and aspirational vision for the country's future. But first, it must fix the organisational and structural deficiencies that have impeded the party's recent election campaigns. Its next president must combine effective leadership with organisational reforms. Delegating powers to state leaders, for example, would free the new Congress leader from onerous administrative tasks and help create the strong local leadership that in previous decades undergirded the party's national appeal.None of this will be easy. But throughout its history, Congress has shown an immense capacity to weather changes and adapt to shifting political circumstances. The people of India are tired of the BJP's domineering and increasingly divisive governance style. To unite the country and reinvent itself, Congress must use the national unity march and the upcoming presidential election to position itself as a clear ideological alternative. India deserves no less. Shashi Tharoor, a former UN under-secretary-general, is an MP for the Indian National Congress.
