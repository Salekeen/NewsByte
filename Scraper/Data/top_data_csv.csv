/weekend-read/news/discovery-may-save-bara-katra-3132221,A discovery that may save Bara Katra,"An exciting new discovery by researchers has raised the hope of saving one of the most important heritage sites of Dhaka – the Bara Katra, a Mughal-era palace built for a prince and later turned into an inn for travellers.The historic stone inscription discovered by Committee for Commissioning Books on Architecture (Dhakar Sthapotto Bishoyok Grontho Pronoyon Committee) is the only testament of ownership of Bara Katra, an ancient site that has been left in neglect and at the mercy of those occupying it.The organisation stumbled upon this precious artefact while researching ancient stone and copper inscriptions found in Dhaka. The stone inscription was found in Bangladesh National Museum and, after examining it, the researchers realised that it was the original stone inscription on the north gate of the palace.During the Mughal era, Bara Katra was used as the caravanserai for travellers and merchants. However, its occupants changed over time. Some of the subadars of the late Mughal era also resided in this palace. 


During the Mughal era, Bara Katra was used as the caravanserai for travellers and merchants. However, its occupants changed over time. Some of the subadars of the late Mughal era also resided in this palace. The inscription clearly declares Bara Katra and the 22 shops adjacent to the palace as 'waqf' property.Waqf property is an inalienable charitable endowment under Islamic law. Eminent architectural historian and president of Arch Asia, a representative body of Asian architects, Professor Dr Abu Sayeed M Ahmed said, ""According to the law, waqf property can never be owned by any individual. The stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra testifies that Bara Katra is in no way a private property.""However, the current occupants of Bara Katra are claiming that they are owners of this historic place.According to the Committee's research, renowned author, researcher and chronicler Hakim Habibur Rahman obtained the historic stone inscription at the end of the British Raj era. However, Rahman and his son never revealed anything about this precious collection before handing it over to the national museum.""The committee has identified the historic stone inscription as a part of its research work. The committee has further discovered four stone inscriptions about Dhaka currently stored in different museums which were also considered lost,"" Professor Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique, chairman of the committee and former vice chancellor of Dhaka University, told The Daily Star.A team of researchers led by Mawlana Muhammad Nuruddin Fatehpuri identified these lost artefacts and deciphered the Arabic, Persian and Urdu inscriptions.According to sources, two stone inscriptions were attached to Bara Katra's two main gates. The inscription on the southern gate stated the year of its construction and the northern gate's inscription was about the endowment of the property.While the northern gate has become dilapidated, the southern gate of Bara Katra remains comparatively intact.There is a 18-line poetry written in Nastaliq script in the stone inscription that mentions the construction year of the palace. The inscription was engraved in 18 different black stone tablets which were attached around the dome of the southern gate of the palace.The stone inscription of the northern gate of the palace was written in prose, in Tughra script. In this script, Abul Qashim Al Hussaini Attabatayi Assemani is named as the architect of the palace.The transliteration and translation of the stone inscription of the northern gate were first published in Charles D'Oyly's book 'Antiquities of Dhaka' in 1822.While the stone inscription was in the national museum, it was assumed that it was lost. The fragmented pieces of it were preserved in two wooden frames separately, preventing researchers from deciphering them. Renowned historian Syed Muhammed Taifoor published a book titled 'Glimpses of Old Dhaka' in 1956 where he stated that the stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra was lost. Other historians, referring to Taifoor have also confirmed that the inscription was lost.As part of discovering Dhaka's history, the committee studied many stone inscriptions preserved in the museums of Bangladesh and West Bengal. During their study, they reviewed the documents about stone inscriptions preserved in the Bangladesh National Museum and contacted the family members who had donated the inscriptions.In this process, they came to know that the stone inscription preserved in the museum was the actual stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra.According to Bangladesh National Museum records, Hakim Irtizar Rahman Khan, the eldest son of Hakim Habibur Rahman Khan donated the stone tablet with the inscription, to the museum on April 14, 1967. It was fragmented into 12 small pieces. Hakim Irtizar Rahman Khan died on July 30, 1980.""If the fragments of the stone tablet preserved in the museum can be arranged sequentially, then the inscription can be deciphered easily,"" Mawlana Muhammad Nuruddin Fatehpuri said while explaining why it took so long to find it.Renowned photographer Mahfuzur Rahman Khan, in a 2015 interview, told the committee that his grandfather Hakim Habibur Rahman Khan collected that stone inscription and his father, Hakim Irtizar got the inscription from his father. However, they could not give any information about how Hakim Habibur Rahman Khan obtained the stone inscription.The inscription, written in Persian, read, ""Sultan Shah Shuja dedicated himself to different types of charitable activities. Abul Qashim Al Hussaini Attabatayi Assimani endowed this holy place and 22 of its adjacent shops as Waqf. And, according to Islamic laws, he stated a specific condition-that the trustee of the property will spend all the earnings from the property and the adjacent shops for the maintenance of the building and for the welfare of the poor. If an impoverished person arrives here, the person shall be offered free accommodation and shall not be charged for any services so that the trustee will get the rewards on the Day of Judgement. If anyone violates this condition, the person will be held accountable on the Day of Judgement. The engraver of the inscription is Sa'duddin and the inscription was engraved in 1055 Mohammedan Year."" (Translated from Persian to Bengali by Muhammad Nuruddin Fatehpuri)
Hakim Habibur Rahman authored a number of books on Dhaka. However, none of them carries any reference to the stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra.
According to researcher Hashem Sufi, Hakim Habibur Rahman collected stone inscriptions from various places in Dhaka and donated them to museums.
During the Mughal era, Bara Katra was used as the caravanserai for travellers and merchants. However, its occupants changed over time. Some of the subadars of the late Mughal era also resided in this palace. Nawabs of Dhaka also used it as their residence before the construction of Nimtali palace. At one point, the palace became a shelter for homeless people.
At present, the southwest part of the palace is being used as a madrasa and the southeast part of the palace is occupied by local goons. They have built numerous shops, factories and warehouses and destroyed much of the original structure of the palace.
Recently, one of the current occupants started to demolish one of the remaining parts of the palace. Fortunately, on September 11, Rakhi Roy, regional director of the department of archaeology, and his team stopped them. Later, Barrister Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation paid a visit to Bara Katra and Chhoto Katra. Director General of the directorate of archaeology Ratan Chandra Pandit and architectural historian Professor Dr Abu Sayeed M Ahmed also accompanied him.

""Bara Katra must be preserved under government custody. It can be given to the custody of the city corporation or the district administration or even to the directorate of archaeology. But it cannot be handed over to any individual,"" the DSCC mayor said during the visit.
He acknowledged that negligence of government agencies has allowed the palace to be damaged and promised to preserve it.
Professor Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique welcomed the mayor's visit and commitment.
""Bara Katra and Chhoto Katra are two of our greatest heritages and archaeological assets of Dhaka. We should not change their original structure in the name of renovation and modernisation. Renovation works should be done under the supervision of an expert committee so that the original structure of the building can be maintained,"" he said.
Ratan Chandra Pandit, director general of the directorate of archaeology explained the challenges of preserving the structure to The Daily Star.
""The directorate of archaeology is responsible for the maintenance of Bara Katra. However, it is not the current owner of the land of Bara Katra. Whenever our officials go to renovate the structure, they face strong resistance from the current occupants. The archaeology department took an initiative to acquire the land of Bara Katra in 2009, but it failed. We will take another initiative to acquire the land. We have the expertise and resources to preserve and maintain Bara Katra but we need cooperation from the City Corporation, district administration, waqf administration and local people,"" he added.

/rohingya-influx/news/myanmar-conflicts-hurting-bangladesh-3132071,Myanmar conflicts hurting Bangladesh,"Conflicts in Myanmar intensified after the military coup on February 1 last year, as pro-democracy activists, the armed wing of National Unity Government and three dozen ethnic armed groups began fighting the junta.The Arakan Army, which was maintaining a ceasefire since November 2020, engaged in conflicts with the military from the middle of this year.The conflict has escalated to the point that there have been instances of mortar shells landing on Bangladesh's side of the border.Given that Bangladesh has been negotiating for repatriation of around one million Rohingya refugees, the conflict has serious implications on Bangladesh and beyond, analysts say.They observed that the Myanmar military is losing the public trust it enjoyed for decades. The junta has also become weaker while fighting the combines of the NUG's armed wing Peoples' Defence Force and ethnic armed groups that have been fighting for autonomy.Now, armed groups have become stronger and are stepping up their battle for full autonomy.The Arakan Army has been able to control administration in much of Rakhine State and is now desperate to take full control of the state, which is strategically important due to its proximity to the Bay of Bengal, they observed.Shahab Enam Khan, professor of international relations at Jahangirnagar University, said the junta also could not deliver on the five-point ASEAN consensus, including ending violence and restoring democracy. Also, the economy is suffering, and that is affecting Rakhine, already a cash-starved region.Harvard University Fellow Anu Anwar, an expert on Myanmar and China, said the Myanmar military had for decades been able to maintain territorial integrity despite being in a civil war with various armed groups.""What is new is the addition of new rebel groups, intensification of fighting in Arakan, and the emergence of NUG's armed wing. Most importantly, [there is] a tacit consensus among major armed groups on a common enemy -- military junta. Therefore, certainly this time the challenge is much greater.""Free Rohingya Coalition Co-founder Nay San Lwin, who is based in Germany, said the Burmese youths are much more united now against the Myanmar junta -- a reality that reflects the unity among the wider public of Myanmar. He thinks in the long run, the military will not last.Prof Shahab Anam said Myanmar is moving towards massive chaos as the military is failing to properly handle the situation. Eventually, chaos may lead to disintegration of Myanmar, he said.The intensified fighting will severely affect Myanmar's economy, which is already in a bad shape after the Covid-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions amid the Russia-Ukraine war. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the conflicts across Myanmar, while several thousands were killed.Prof Shahab said so far, mostly the Rohingyas have been the victims of conflicts in Rakhine State, but now Rakhine Buddhists are also becoming victims. Therefore, there is a real possibility of displacement of hundreds of thousands in Rakhine State.In that case, Bangladesh and Myanmar's other neighbours have reasons to worry.Anu Anwar said the intensified fighting certainly accelerated the possibility of disintegration.He said geo-strategically, Myanmar connects South and Southeast Asia with the Bay of Bengal. For economic, connectivity, and geopolitical reasons, regional powers such as Japan or India and superpowers like the US, China and Russia take a greater interest in Myanmar affairs.""A conflict in Myanmar will have multidimensional effects on the regional geopolitics…""Bangladesh, in particular, will be the primary victim of any conflict in and around Myanmar. A turmoil in Myanmar will not only increase the chances of a fresh influx of Rohingyas but also create the real possibility of an active conflict between two armed forces along the Naf River.""Anwar said there has never been any real hope of repatriation regardless of the regime in Naypyitaw. Not a single leader in Myanmar has ever taken meaningful initiative towards reparation.The only time Myanmar has taken the Rohingya issue seriously was in 1978, when the government of Bangladesh made a credible threat that unless Myanmar took back their people, Bangladesh would arm Rohingyas, and if necessary, Bangladesh's military would launch a pre-emptive strike against Burma. Since then, Bangladesh has pursued only diplomatic means, but that has produced no substantial results as the number of Rohingya refugees only increased, he said.""A fresh crackdown in Rakhine will not only tarnish the dying hope of repatriation but will generate a real possibility of a further influx of millions of Rohingyas into Bangladesh.""Shahab Enam Khan and Naw San Lwin said Rohingyas will not be willing to return to Myanmar when conflicts are escalating there.The experts said Myanmar's violation of territorial sovereignty and Rohingya repatriation are separate issues and should be dealt with separately.Anu Anwar said defending the land, air, and maritime boundary of a country is the duty of the armed forces.Shahab said Bangladesh should have deployed troops for deterrence and strongly raised Myanmar's violation of sovereignty with the UN.""Bangladesh needs to build a coalition of countries that support Bangladesh to mount pressure on Myanmar and work for Rohingya repatriation,"" he said, adding that bilateral negotiation is not working anymore.Nay San Lwin thought the same.Shahab Enam said Myanmar faced various sanctions because of the genocide against Rohingyas and military coup, mainly from western countries. Now, despite good relations, world powers like China and Russia, and even Japan, India and ASEAN are feeling uneasy about Myanmar.But it is likely that Myanmar's resources will still continue to attract them more than those of Bangladesh, he said.Anu Anwar said Beijing and Moscow provided cushion for the junta, which is nothing new. However, the new aspect is that world support for Bangladesh has increased in a dramatic fashion over the last few years.""Myanmar's isolation is a win for Bangladesh if Dhaka is able to seize the opportunity,"" he said.",2022-10-01
/weekend-read/news/the-colourful-history-bara-katra-3132216,The colourful history of Bara Katra ,"""Katra"" is a Persian word that means caravanserai or roadside inn. Multiple katras were constructed during Mughal and Nawabi eras in Dhaka. Of them, Bara Katra and Chhoto Katra are mentionable.According to historians, Bara Katra was constructed in 1643-1644 CE/ 1053 AH by Abul Qashim who was ordered by the then subadar (Mughal provincial governor) prince Shah Shuja. Shuja constructed it for his official residence. However, the Mughal prince did not like the palace and donated it to Abul Qashim who converted it into a caravanserai. The palace was endowed for charitable purposes in 1645-46 CE/ 1055 AH.Bara Katra was located in between the Buriganga River and Chawk Bazaar. The river used to flow along the southern side of the palace even three centuries after its construction. The flow of the river was diverted due to the construction of an embankment to protect Dhaka from annual flooding. Later, human settlements mushroomed along the embankment and all around the palace. At present, the Bara Katra is located at Bara Katra Lane in Ward number 30 of Dhaka South City Corporation.Bara Katra is an ideal depiction of the Mughal architectural style. The two-stoey building was erected around an open rectangular courtyard. The palace overlooks the Buriganga River. There were two gates on the southern and northern corners of the palace and two small gateways on the western and eastern sides. ",2022-10-01
/youth/education/news/teachers-public-univs-worktime-set-40-hours-week-3132066,Teachers at public univs: Worktime set at  40 hours a week,"A public university teacher will have to work 40 hours a week. Of this period, 13 hours must be spent on providing direct lessons to students on average.This has been stipulated by a policy, drawn up by the University Grants Commission in order to fix the teaching workload of all faculty members of the public universities.The policy titled ""Teaching load calculation policy for public university teachers"" has been prepared to keep teachers on the campus for a longer period and determine how many teachers are needed for a particular university for proper education and research.Under the policy, a professor's direct teaching hour will be 10 hours, an associate professor's 12 hours, an assistant professor's 14 hours and a lecturer's 16 hours, said UGC officials.Besides lecturing at classes, each teacher will have to conduct student counseling for one hour per week.UGC officials said once the policy comes into force next week, teachers' stay on the campus and their engagement with students will increase significantly.The policy will be sent to all public universities by next week.According to officials, there are allegations that many public university teachers do not spend enough time on the campus, and teach at private universities instead. Many even take classes at five-six private universities. Some of them spend time on consultancy jobs.""We hope that public university teachers will stay at the campus for a longer time following the implementation of the policy,"" said Ferdous Zaman, secretary of UGC.He said that a UGC meeting on Tuesday finalised the policy.Commission officials also said that sufficientnumber of teachers is essential for ensuing proper educational and research activities at public universities. The policy has been devised to ensure this. It will also be helpful in determining the number of teachers needed for any particular university.""Following the implementation of the policy, it will be easier to determine how many teachers will be required for the higher education institutions. In addition, this policy will play an important role in preparing organograms of different departments of universities. Renowned academicians have cooperated with the UGC in formulating this policy,"" said Prof Dil Afroza Begum, acting chairman of UGC.There are 15,500 teachers at 53 public universities. About 3.50 lakh students study at 50 of those universities.In the policy, a teacher's weekly 40 work hours has been divided into two parts -- Contact Hours and Non-Contact Hours. The 40 hours included five hours for prayers and lunch break.Under the Contact Hours, a teacher will have to deliver lectures at the classroom, give lessons at practical classes, hold tutorial classes, and supervise projects, internships or thesesof students for 13 hours per week.A teacher's Non-contact Hourswould cover preparation of course materials, conducting research, writing articles and books, preparing questions, evaluating exam answer scripts and attending academic and administrative meetings.The policy says that the Contact Hoursfor the head of a department and institution will be six hours.Universities will be able to apply to the UGC for having 20 percent additional teachers for a particular department or institute, if there is a possibility of disruption in educational activities due to study leave of a large number of teachers, it adds.Universities will file such applications based on teaching load calculation of a particular department or institution.According to the policy, if the number of teachers working in a particular department is found bigger after calculation of teaching load, the additional number of teachers will continue in their jobs till retirement.UGC Secretary Ferdous said there were serious problems regarding determining how many teachers were needed due to absence of a policy.""We have seen that 10 teachers were recruited against the requirement of five. In other cases, five teachers were appointed against the required 10,"" he said.UGC officials said a policy of workload of teachers at Indian universityis in place. A full-time teacher's working hours should not be less than 40 hours a week for 30 working weeks in an academic year, and the teacher must be available for at least five hours daily in the university/college.Under the policy, professors and associate professors need to give 14 hours of direct teaching per week, whereas for assistant professors the requirement is 16 hours.Prof Nizamul Hoque Bhuiyan, general secretary of the Federation of Bangladesh University Teachers Association, said they would be able to comment on whether the policy was bad or good only after it came into force.""We have to improve the quality of education and the international rankings of the universities. To achieve these goals, we will need to conduct innovative researches and introduce research-oriented education…if we can use the working hours positively, it will be good for us,"" said Nizamul, also the general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers Association.",2022-10-01

/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/russia-annexes-four-regions-ukraine-3132076,Russia annexes four regions  of Ukraine,"""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever. We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means."" Russian President Vladimir Putin 
A defiant Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russia's annexation of a swathe of Ukraine in a pomp-filled Kremlin ceremony yesterday, promising Moscow would triumph in its ""special military operation"" against Kyiv even as some of his troops faced potential defeat. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Putin's proclamation of Russian rule over about 15 percent of Ukraine -- the biggest annexation in Europe since the second world war -- has been firmly rejected by Western countries and even many of Russia's close allies.
 








The declaration has been condemned by the West and prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to request fast-track Nato membership.



In one of the toughest anti-American speeches the Russian president has delivered in more than two decades in power, he signalled he was ready to continue a battle for a ""greater historical Russia"" using whatever tools he had at his disposal and slammed the West as neo-colonial and Satanist.
 







(L-R) The Moscow-appointed heads of the Kherson region Vladimir Saldo and Zaporizhzhia region Yevgeny Balitsky, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Donetsk separatist leader Denis Pushilin and Lugansk separatist leader Leonid Pasechnik join hands after signing treaties formally annexing four regions of Ukraine, at the Kremlin in Moscow, yesterday.

Putin said the US had set a precedent when it had dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945, but stopped short of issuing new nuclear warnings against Ukraine himself, something he has done more than once in recent weeks.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had not yet seen Russia take any action that suggested it is contemplating the use of nuclear weapons, despite what he called Putin's ""loose talk.""



""Truth is on our side. Russia is with us!"" Putin told his country's political elite, who had gathered in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls to watch him sign documents annexing four Ukrainian regions.
The ceremony culminated in the 69-year-old leader chanting ""Russia Russia!"" as he clasped the hands of the four Russian-backed officials he wants to run the annexed regions, which Ukraine is fighting to win back.
""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever,"" said Putin, referring to the four Ukrainian regions which he said Russia was annexing.
""We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means,"" he said, calling on ""the Kyiv regime to immediately cease hostilities and return to the negotiation table"".
Zelensky, speaking in Kyiv, said he was ready for peace talks if and when Russia got a new president and announced that Ukraine was formally applying for fast-track membership of the Nato military alliance, something Moscow fiercely opposes.
Kyiv's move to join Nato was the pretext that Putin used for the offensive he launched on February 24.
""We have already proven our compatibility with (Nato) alliance standards,"" Zelensky said in a video posted by the Ukrainian presidency on social media.
""We are taking a decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to Nato,"" he added.
Zelensky and the West have condemned referendums that Moscow held in the four Ukrainian regions as illegal shams, while several dozen Ukrainians interviewed by Reuters in the last week said that only people they described as ""Russian collaborators"" had voted, with most people boycotting them.
US President Joe Biden condemned Russia's ""fraudulent"" declaration, vowing to keep backing Kyiv army.
""We will continue to support Ukraine's efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically,"" he said.
Washington yesterday announced new ""severe"" sanctions against Russian officials and the country's defence industry.
The latest sanctions come on top of sweeping measures already imposed by the US and allies this year that have already crippled Russia's international trading and local economy. But they stop short of Russia's energy industry, the country's largest source of hard currency.
Guidance from the US Treasury and Commerce departments warned that anyone outside Russia, including companies, that provide political, economic or material support to Moscow faced a heightened risk of sanctions.
The Treasury sanctions generally freeze any US assets of those designated and bar Americans from dealing with them.
Commerce added 57 entities in Russia and Crimea to bar exports.
Treasury said it imposed sanctions on 14 people in Russia's military-industrial complex, two leaders of the central bank, family members of top officials and 278 members of the legislature ""for enabling Russia's sham referenda and attempt to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory.""
Canada yesterday announced measures against dozens of oligarchs, financial elites and their family members, and 35 Russian-backed senior officials in the regions where the referendums took place.
Britain also put sanctions on the governor of the Russian central bank and imposed bans on new services and goods export.
Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said recent actions by Russia constitute the most serious escalation of the conflict since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February.
""This land grab is illegal and illegitimate. Nato allies do not and will not recognize any of this territory as part of Russia,"" Stoltenberg said.
""Putin has mobilised hundreds of thousands of more troops, engaged in irresponsible nuclear sabre-rattling and now illegally annexed more Ukrainian territory. Together, this represents the most serious escalation since the start of the war,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference.
However, he said the decision on Ukraine's Nato membership requires ""consensus"" of allies.
G7 and EU also said they would ""never recognise"" Russia's annexation of four more regions in Ukraine and pledged further sanctions against Moscow.
Despite warnings from Putin prior to the annexation that he could use nuclear weapons to defend the captured territories, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would ""continue liberating our land and our people"".
In central Moscow, at least 10,000 people convened for state-organised annexation celebrations, with huge banners emblazoned: ""Donetsk. Lugansk. Zaporizhzhia. Kherson. Russia!""
A concert in Red Square was replete with military and pomp and patriotic songs and throngs of Russians waving the national flag.
The four territories create a crucial land corridor between Russia and the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014.
The Kremlin said it ""needed to clarify"" the exact borders of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- neither fully controlled by Moscow's forces -- that it intends to annex.
Together, all five regions including Crimea, make up around 20 percent of Ukraine, whose forces in recent weeks have been clawing back wins as part of a counter-offensive.
The UN Security Council was scheduled to vote later yesterday on a resolution condemning the referendums, according to France, the council's current president, but it has no chance of passing due to Moscow's veto power.
""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever. We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means."" A defiant Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russia's annexation of a swathe of Ukraine in a pomp-filled Kremlin ceremony yesterday, promising Moscow would triumph in its ""special military operation"" against Kyiv even as some of his troops faced potential defeat.Putin's proclamation of Russian rule over about 15 percent of Ukraine -- the biggest annexation in Europe since the second world war -- has been firmly rejected by Western countries and even many of Russia's close allies.The declaration has been condemned by the West and prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to request fast-track Nato membership.In one of the toughest anti-American speeches the Russian president has delivered in more than two decades in power, he signalled he was ready to continue a battle for a ""greater historical Russia"" using whatever tools he had at his disposal and slammed the West as neo-colonial and Satanist.Putin said the US had set a precedent when it had dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945, but stopped short of issuing new nuclear warnings against Ukraine himself, something he has done more than once in recent weeks.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had not yet seen Russia take any action that suggested it is contemplating the use of nuclear weapons, despite what he called Putin's ""loose talk.""""Truth is on our side. Russia is with us!"" Putin told his country's political elite, who had gathered in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls to watch him sign documents annexing four Ukrainian regions.The ceremony culminated in the 69-year-old leader chanting ""Russia Russia!"" as he clasped the hands of the four Russian-backed officials he wants to run the annexed regions, which Ukraine is fighting to win back.""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever,"" said Putin, referring to the four Ukrainian regions which he said Russia was annexing.""We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means,"" he said, calling on ""the Kyiv regime to immediately cease hostilities and return to the negotiation table"".Zelensky, speaking in Kyiv, said he was ready for peace talks if and when Russia got a new president and announced that Ukraine was formally applying for fast-track membership of the Nato military alliance, something Moscow fiercely opposes.Kyiv's move to join Nato was the pretext that Putin used for the offensive he launched on February 24.""We have already proven our compatibility with (Nato) alliance standards,"" Zelensky said in a video posted by the Ukrainian presidency on social media.""We are taking a decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to Nato,"" he added.Zelensky and the West have condemned referendums that Moscow held in the four Ukrainian regions as illegal shams, while several dozen Ukrainians interviewed by Reuters in the last week said that only people they described as ""Russian collaborators"" had voted, with most people boycotting them.US President Joe Biden condemned Russia's ""fraudulent"" declaration, vowing to keep backing Kyiv army.""We will continue to support Ukraine's efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically,"" he said.Washington yesterday announced new ""severe"" sanctions against Russian officials and the country's defence industry.The latest sanctions come on top of sweeping measures already imposed by the US and allies this year that have already crippled Russia's international trading and local economy. But they stop short of Russia's energy industry, the country's largest source of hard currency.Guidance from the US Treasury and Commerce departments warned that anyone outside Russia, including companies, that provide political, economic or material support to Moscow faced a heightened risk of sanctions.The Treasury sanctions generally freeze any US assets of those designated and bar Americans from dealing with them.Commerce added 57 entities in Russia and Crimea to bar exports.Treasury said it imposed sanctions on 14 people in Russia's military-industrial complex, two leaders of the central bank, family members of top officials and 278 members of the legislature ""for enabling Russia's sham referenda and attempt to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory.""Canada yesterday announced measures against dozens of oligarchs, financial elites and their family members, and 35 Russian-backed senior officials in the regions where the referendums took place.Britain also put sanctions on the governor of the Russian central bank and imposed bans on new services and goods export.Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said recent actions by Russia constitute the most serious escalation of the conflict since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February.""This land grab is illegal and illegitimate. Nato allies do not and will not recognize any of this territory as part of Russia,"" Stoltenberg said.""Putin has mobilised hundreds of thousands of more troops, engaged in irresponsible nuclear sabre-rattling and now illegally annexed more Ukrainian territory.

/news/bangladesh/news/the-fight-save-their-field-3132146,The fight to save their field,"For decades, the residents of Mirpur-11 have made themselves well-acquainted with the only open space they have, the one located on Paris Road. Many grew up playing there every day after school, and many made lifelong friends and memories after spending hours on end in the field.Fourteen places had been earmarked as playgrounds, parks or fields in Mirpur. But they were turned into plots in 1994, as per the decision of then housing minister, violating the master plan and depriving local residents.This place was one of them.""This field on Paris Road was also turned into plots at that time. But we've been trying to protect the place since then,"" said Kazi Jahirul Islam Manik, ward-3 councillor of Dhaka North City Corporation.Manik said the three lakh residents of ward-3 do not have any field or park aside from this open space.And so, for a long time locals have been waging a fight, demanding the government protect their lone field, he added. Recently, after the new DAP was gazetted last month, their protest got momentum as the place has been designated as an open space there.Locals also organised a human chain and hunger strike to save the place, which was allotted to a section of people, violating the master plan of Dhaka Improvement Trust 1963.Currently the space remains abandoned, with piled up garbage  dumped there.""This land was earmarked as an open space in the 1963 master plan. It's also an open space in the new Detailed Area Plan,"" said Manik.Manik initiated a hunger strike on Thursday. A large number of people, including students, teachers, and guardians of 37 schools; former national football players; local clubs; and imams took part.The residents want the field to be handed over to the city corporation, no matter who the owner is. They wish for this place to turn into a proper field, he said.Sustainable Development Goals states that for every 12,500 people, a separate playground and park is a must. Going off that information, 24 such spaces are required for the ward. And yet, this is the lone playing field, Manik explained.In 2017, the prime minister issued a directive saying that this place will remain a playing field, he mentioned.The 1994 allotment is unethical and should be cancelled, Manik demanded.Ashrafun Nesa Parul, senior teacher of Jannat Academy High School, was brought up in the area. She said this field is crucial for the children's physical and mental development.""We want our children to lead a healthy life; every family here wants that,"" she added.Mohammad Anowar Hossain Ripon, principal of Mirpur Science College, said his institution has no playground or field, and locals have almost no place to play. So, the lone field is the only bastion for the youngsters. Elderly people also benefit, as they have a place for regular physical activities.Showing solidarity with the movement, DNCC Mayor Md Atiqul Islam requested the prime minister to allot the space as a playing field.The mayor, who visited the area on Thursday, said the area has over three lakh residents and around 60 educational institutes. But there is no field for them.The field is designated as an open space in the new DAP, but National Housing Authority has allotted it as plots. This is absolutely unacceptable, he said. ""We will protect this field with the support of locals.""Thirty percent of Dhaka city wards do not have any playground or park. This situation hinders the mental and physical growth of children, as they have no space to play and interact with friends, say experts.According to the DAP, 25 out of 75 wards under Dhaka South City Corporation and 10 out of 55 wards under DNCC do not have a single park or playground.About 20 million people live in the capital, and considering the population density, there should be over a dozen parks and play areas in each ward, said Adil Mohammad Khan, former general secretary of Bangladesh Institute of Planners.""But there's a dearth of open spaces, and the available places get too crowded. Ultimately, many children are discouraged to go to the few parks or playgrounds we have,"" he explained.",2022-10-01

Captain Nigar Sultana Joty said they were not taking any added pressure as hosts, but would like to make the most of playing at their 'home venue'.""It's not a challenge [playing at home] to be playing at home. Our target is to go match by match. We are not going to nit-pick the opposition's strengths and weaknesses. If we can execute our plans, we don't have to worry about challenges,"" she said.Teams such as India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan will once again prove to be the main obstacles to Tigresses defending the trophy, but the skipper believes her team has improved as well.""Every team has improved and so have we. We just want to maintain and go forward with our plans.The women's [cricket team's] home venue is Sylhet, so of course we want to take advantage of that. Since the trophy belongs to us, we will try to defend it. The target is to retain the trophy,"" she said.Medium pacer Jahanara Alam is set to feature in the tournament, having missed the World Cup qualifiers due to a hand injury, and Joty believed the pacer's experience would come in handy.The weather at Sylhet has been pretty hot as teams gear up for the tournament, but Joty was not too concerned.""We are not thinking of the weather. Since we played in Abu Dhabi, the temperature being high there provided us with good preparation. The good news is that no one faced pulled any muscles in that weather or had any other concerns which is a sign that everyone is fit,"" she concluded.",2022-10-01
/news/bangladesh/news/dhakas-canine-conundrum-3132141,Dhaka’s canine conundrum,"Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation have taken no visibly effective measures to control the urban dog population, and this has led to city residents treating neighbourhood dogs in a cruel, violent and inhumane manner.The High Court banned dog culling in 2020 on grounds of animal rights. Meanwhile, experts and animal-rights activists believe sterilisation is the appropriate measure to control the dog population.However, due to the lack of human resources, budget and planning, neither DNCC nor DSCC are unable to discharge their duties in this regard.According to Dhaka Infectious Disease Hospital, 45,477 people were treated for dog bite-related injuries in 2020, while the number rose to 52,012 in 2021.So far, around 38,000 people have received treatment from the hospital with similar injuries this year.Compared to these numbers, vaccination drives have proven to be insufficient.Communicable Disease Control (CDC) of DGHS stated that 42,935 dogs were vaccinated in areas under the two city corporations in 2019. As part of rabies eradication measures, 49,580 dogs were vaccinated in 2020.However, the drives stopped after one year and nine months.""There has been no activity for a year. Councillors have no opportunity to take any action in this regard. People in my area have killed three dogs in the last two weeks,'' said Saidul Islam, councillor of ward-57 under DSCC.Rubaiya Ahmed, chairperson of Obhoyaronno, said DNCC has provided some support to their operations, while DSCC has remained inactive since 2014.In 2020, after a petition was filed to stop transferring dogs from their territories, DSCC promised to implement a neutering and vaccination programme for neighbourhood dogs, Rubaiya said.""However, they continue to cull and relocate dogs at any given chance. They do not have any sustainable plan in this regard,"" she added.Rakibul Haq Emil, founder and chairperson of People for Animal Welfare (PAW) Foundation, said sterilisation operations are crucial from the July-to-September period, the peak season for dog breeding.""However, no such activities have been in place. People continue to grow more hostile to their neighbourhood dogs,"" said Emil.""Our organisation receives four to five reports of dog culling every month. The two city corporations cannot avoid their responsibility in this regard,"" he added.DNCC Public Health Officer Lutfar Rahman said there is no workforce or logistical support for controlling the dog population.""In the current economic situation, there is not enough budget for this work. Efforts are being made with limited workforce. A lack of awareness leads to people killing dogs,'' he said.DSCC Chief Health Officer Dr Fazle Shamsul Karim echoed the same. He said five veterinary doctors have joined DSCC's health department recently.Dr M Mujibur Rahaman, DGHS expert of mass dog vaccination programme, said due to excessive pollution in Dhaka city, lack of adequate waste management, and overcrowding, most dogs have some sort of sickness.""Bites and other untoward incidents are reduced when dogs are healthy and in controlled numbers,"" he said.""Coordination between the two city corporation authorities is required to conduct neutering programmes,"" he added.DNCC has been running such programmes for 10 years despite the lack of human resources.

/sports/cricket/news/historic-female-inclusive-asia-cup-commences-today-3132046,Historic female-inclusive Asia Cup commences today,"The much-awaited Women's Asia Cup, played in the 20-over format since 2012, returns with its eighth edition in Sylhet as the curtain-raiser sees defending champions Bangladesh take on Thailand at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium Ground 2 (SICS Outer) today from Bangladesh Standard Time 9:00 am.The coronavirus pandemic had postponed the biennial event by a couple of years after the previous edition was played in 2018, where Bangladesh broke the complete monopoly India had over the regional competition. The final was a game to remember for everyone, a game which saw the Tigresses bag a three-wicket win with a last-ball thriller to seal their maiden Asia Cup triumph against the six-time winners. A competition that featured only two teams – India and Sri Lanka – in its augural edition in 2004 before Pakistan and Bangladesh began participating from the second and fourth edition onwards, respectively, this Asia Cup features as many as seven teams -- including hosts Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, and the UAE – aim to fight for the Asian supremacy over the span of two weeks.Bangladesh team led by Nigar Sultana Joty are well-balanced with a fine blend of youth and experience. ""As hosts, we will give 110 per cent to defend our title,"" said Joty after returning home from the UAE.


Bangladesh team led by Nigar Sultana Joty are well-balanced with a fine blend of youth and experience. ""As hosts, we will give 110 per cent to defend our title,"" said Joty after returning home from the UAE.""For the first time in history, 7 women's teams will be participating in a complete round robin format. The ACC is constantly striving toward being more inclusive,"" stated Jay Shah, president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).Record participants aside, as maiden hosts, Bangladesh would be part of a historic chapter as all of the two on-field umpires and the match referee are set to feature female figures, composed of the Sri Lankan trio of Dedunu De Silva, Nimali Perera, and Vanessa De Silva.  ""The 2022 edition of the Women's Asia Cup will therefore see more embedded female participation. For the first time ever, an ACC tournament will see an all-female presence on the playing field, with the women's tournament slated to have only female umpires and female match referees. As an organisation, we hope to continue to take steps to strengthen the sport by highlighting female talent in every avenue,"" further stated the ACC president.This Asia cup has a lot at stake, as ever, especially considering the top teams taking the tournament as a launching pad to get into the groove ahead of the upcoming T20 World Cup in 2023. Bangladesh have come a long way since debuting in the T20 international circuit in 2012 and would want to see their growth curve going upward following a string of impressive performances this year in the format.Even though the Tigresses missed out on a spot at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games as the result in the decider in January went into Sri Lanka's favour, but following that event, Bangladesh, however unsurprisingly, had sealed their spot in the upcoming T20 World Cup by becoming the unbeaten champions in the recently concluded Qualifiers, held in the UAE. Bangladesh team led by Nigar Sultana Joty are well-balanced with a fine blend of youth and experience. ""As hosts, we will give 110 per cent to defend our title,"" said Joty after returning home from the UAE.As far as tournament favourites are concerned, India remain the team to beat. The latest Commonwealth Games finalists are enjoying a good run of form and despite Jhulan Goswami calling it quits recently, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side appear well balanced without their star performer. Meanwhile, Pakistan are undergoing a rebuilding phase. Their Commonwealth Games journey in July was a disappointment as Pakistan lost all three of the games to remain as bottom dwellers in their group. How captain Bismah Maroof marshals her troops without the injured star pacer Fatima Sana will be a tough ask too, and Pakistan's first big obstacle will be in their second game against Bangladesh on October 03. Sri Lanka, too, would be eager to see their women go the distance after the men's cricket team sealed the bragging rights earlier in the Asia Cup, held last month. Among the seven teams, the UAE and Malaysia – who booked their Asia Cup berths on the virtue of reaching the final of the 10-team ACC Women's T20 Championship earlier in June – would want to display competitive cricket alongside Thailand. As far as the tournament format is concerned, it involves each side playing the other once in a round-robin format. Afterward, the top four sides progress to the semi-finals before the grand finale on October 15.With women's sports in Bangladesh gaining traction after the sustained and recent success of the country's cricket and football teams alike, the historic all-female on-field Asia Cup could provide a massive boost to the fast-evolving sector as the defending champions could draw crowds in numbers to Sylhet from all parts of Bangladesh.Experts may deem India as favourites on paper, but given the tournament features the shortest format, the games are prone to be more competitive. And that is why, when The Daily Star asked Bangladesh captain about her expectations in the Asia Cup and about the difference in quality between Bangladesh and other teams, Joty had replied: ""In T20 cricket, the difference in levels are very close. Whichever team makes fewer mistakes on a particular day has a higher chance to win the game.""",2022-10-01
/opinion/views/news/were-working-very-hard-increase-bangladeshs-export-china-3132011,‘We’re working very hard to increase Bangladesh’s export to China’,"Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming shares his views on the depth and prospects of the bilateral relationship between Bangladesh and China in an exclusive interview with Porimol Palma of The Daily Star, on the occasion of China's 73rd founding anniversary on today.What are the achievements from the Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's recent visit to Bangladesh?China and Bangladesh are amicable neighbours and strategic partners of cooperation. Through the visit, China and Bangladesh renewed commitment to their traditional friendship, reiterated the One China principle, agreed to deepen strategic integration, and further enhanced practical cooperation, thereby jointly committing to maintain stability in the region and beyond amid an uneasy international environment.Bangladesh is going through economic challenges in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. How can China help Bangladesh in mitigating this immediate challenge?To meet the present challenges, I think Bangladesh can do the following together with China: first, join the Global Development Initiative (GDI) proposed by China; second, fully utilise and benefit from the zero-tariff treatment to 98 percent of Bangladeshi products exported to China; third, advance studies on Bangladesh-China FTA and enhance common development of Bangladesh-China economy; fourth, accelerate the promotion of the MoU on special assistance plan for disaster prevention and mitigation; and fifth, promote the work related to taka-renminbi currency swap and enhance Bangladesh's foreign exchange payment capacity.China has two new initiatives: Global Development Initiative (GDI) and Global Security Initiative (GSI). What implications do they have for Bangladesh?President Xi Jinping has put forward these initiatives in response to the urgent needs of developing countries as well as global development and world peace, following the guideline of policy coordination and practical cooperation, so as to help the developing countries maintain national stability, promote economic recovery, and advance the 2030 Agenda. I think these areas are also core concerns for Bangladesh; these solutions will surely assist Bangladesh in solving the present challenges and development difficulties if they can be effectively implemented. China is ready to work with Bangladesh to advance the implementation of GDI and GSI, step up coordination in international and regional affairs, safeguard the common interests of our two countries and other developing countries, jointly promote regional development and prosperity, and build a community with a shared future.China is willing to strengthen the alignment of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Bangladesh's Vision 2041. How will it be done?Bangladesh's Vision 2041 plan provides a roadmap for accelerating growth and lays down broad approaches for eradication of poverty, inequality and human deprivation. By implementing the plan, Bangladesh is expected to make rapid changes in agriculture, trade and industry, education, healthcare, transportation and communication, etc.The BRI is the right avenue for tangible and intangible outcomes pertinent to innovative, harmonised, green, open, high-quality and shared development, which protects and maintains peace and promotes people's well-being in the post-Covid-19 era. BRI is proposed by China, but not owned exclusively by China. Ever since its genesis, BRI has been aimed at integration into the development strategies of all parties interested. Bangladesh is one of the first countries to respond to the BRI and has become one of the countries with the most cooperation and fruitful results under the BRI framework.As strategic partners of cooperation, it is natural for Bangladesh and China to coordinate in terms of development strategies. We have established the Joint Economic and Trade Committee as an institutional arrangement for Bangladesh-China economic and trade cooperation. According to data from China, the bilateral trade between the countries increased significantly in 2021, exceeding USD 25 billion. The turnover of China's contracted projects to Bangladesh remained at the forefront of South Asian countries, and China's investment in Bangladesh increased by more than 290 percent year-on-year.To further enhance integration of development strategy, the two sides could work together in several areas. First, we need to further strengthen political mutual trust, consolidate the foundation for win-win results, enhance risk management and control, and secure the cooperation environment against a rapidly changing international situation. Second, we need to further enhance intergovernmental cooperation and promote implementation of major projects. Third, we need to fully utilise the high-quality projects and expand the volume of cooperation, such as Bangabandhu Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center, the zero-tariff treatment for 98 percent of Bangladeshi products exported to China, and the large-scale international exhibitions like the China International Import Exposition and the Canton Fair. Fourth, we need to explore new opportunities and cultivate new growth points. Specifically, we can promote PPP cooperation, advance studies on bilateral FTA, jointly respond to the pandemic and climate change, restore rivers, develop green and low-carbon energies, and work together on a digital economy.Bangladesh's export to China is less than USD 1 billion a year, though the bilateral trade is USD 25 billion. Why is the trade gap so wide?About one-third of Bangladesh's imports from China are textile fabrics, cotton yarn and thread, man-made filaments and staple fibres, which are all important raw materials for Bangladesh's RMG industry. Apart from the textile raw materials, another 27 percent of Bangladesh's imports from China are machinery and mechanical appliances, electrical machinery and equipment and parts, sound recorders and reproducers, which are important equipment for Bangladesh's various manufacturing industries and infrastructural projects.To put it in another way, although there is a trade deficit, the imported textile raw materials and mechanical equipment (that comprise most of the amount) are all of great necessity and are helping Bangladesh's RMG exports, manufacturing industry and development. So, we need a right perspective to view this temporary imbalance of trade, and we're working very hard to increase Bangladesh's export to China, to reduce trade deficit and maintain trade balances. The duty-free treatment of 98 percent tariff lines is granted by the Chinese government, precisely to increase Bangladesh's exports to China.Since September 1, China is giving duty-free access to 98 percent of Bangladeshi products, which has been increased by one percent. What products would be included in the additional percentage, and can it make any significant increase in export to China?Several kinds of basic leather products have been added, which is good news for Bangladeshi exporters in the leather industry, an industry with huge potential. Businessmen in the leather industry have already been focusing on the opportunity provided by the 98 percent duty-free treatment. Programmes such as ""Bangladesh leather and leather products promotion webinar"" are undergoing and helping Chinese leather product manufacturing enterprises to form business relations with leather exporters in Bangladesh.Dhaka and Beijing signed an agreement for 27 projects with an estimated cost of USD 20 billion. As of now, only eight projects have been undertaken and USD 3.8 billion has been disbursed. Why is that and how can this be sped up?Well, this may not be accurate enough. Bangladesh and China have been actively cooperating and working together to promote the progress of the MoU projects. As far as I know, most of the major projects have been progressing smoothly, more than eight are completed, and a good number of the others are expected to be completed by the end of 2024.Here, we have to make it clear that the MoU on Strengthening Investment and Production Capacity Cooperation, signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Bangladesh in 2016, is not a commitment of a basket of Government Concessional Loan (GCL) or Preferential Buyers Credit (PBC). The 27 projects attached to the MoU are only a list of projects to be considered for promotion by both sides, not a list of GCL or PBC projects. It should be stressed that only projects that have been evaluated and approved by both sides and for which loan agreements have been signed are the GCL and PBC projects, for which the Chinese side would commit to provide GCL or PBC loan support.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi proposed signing an MoU on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Cooperation Framework. How can signing this MoU help? Is the PPP model more efficient?It will help the governments to better play the regulatory role, select better quality enterprises to participate in the economic cooperation between Bangladesh and China, constantly improve the quality and efficiency of cooperation, and better avoid risks. At the same time, it will help Chinese companies better and more widely participate in Bangladesh's construction in the fields of energy, urban development, ports, rail transit, roads and bridges, airports, and so on. We believe that signing a G2G MoU on PPP is an ideal way of enhancing bilateral cooperation and will serve the interests of both sides.High costs of projects and their commercial feasibility are an issue of concern. This is much talked about in the case of Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port. Do you have any new policy in mind regarding cost efficiency in Chinese projects and funding?All Chinese projects have been evaluated and approved by the Bangladesh government and the Chinese government before implementation. Economic feasibility and cost efficiency of the projects have been fully demonstrated by professional institutions on both sides and recognised by both governments. Bangladesh and China will continue to strengthen cooperation and work together in this area. If anyone can name any single Chinese-funded project that is commercially or financially unfeasible, please tell me.How do you want to cooperate on environmental protection and climate change actions as Bangladesh is at the forefront of the challenges?Climate change and green development constitute one of the eight areas of GDI. Under this framework, China will carry out more extensive cooperation with Bangladesh in the fields of renewable resources and clean energy. We will encourage and guide Chinese enterprises to adopt more advanced technologies and equipment to invest in more environmentally friendly projects in Bangladesh.A common perception is that China is not doing enough in addressing the Rohingya crisis, given that you have strong influence in Myanmar. How do you respond to the criticism?China has been a facilitator between the two countries, and has always held that the issue should be resolved peacefully through bilateral negotiation and consultation. We have been providing support to both Bangladesh and Myanmar, aiming to improve the ground-level condition and to create a favourable environment for commencing repatriation. Because of the political change in Myanmar early last year, negotiations on the Rohingya issue were once suspended between Bangladesh and Myanmar. However, the intent to solve the problem propelled the two neighbours back on track for discussion, leading to re-engagement at various levels, including the Fifth Joint Working Group meeting held in June this year. We call upon all like-minded countries to do the same. The international community should play a constructive role in the process of finding a durable solution to the Rohingya issue.",2022-10-01

The issue was the way that he (Guardiola) understood football and what he wanted.""In this case, it's up to you to accept it or not. If you don't accept it, then 'thanks' and let's go for another challenge.""I accepted it for a while but then I got to the point when I said: 'I want something else for me'. I thanked him ... he understood and that's it.""The former Palmeiras forward had been unhappy with the amount of playing time he was given by Guardiola and left City as the Citizens signed Norway star Erling Haaland and young Argentine prospect Julian Alvarez.Haaland has made a sensational start with 11 goals in seven league games.Jesus spent five years in Manchester, winning the Premier League four times, the FA Cup once, the League Cup three times, and playing in the 2021 Champions League final.But he was unhappy at being mostly deployed by Guardiola on the flank rather than his preferred center forward role.""Here at Arsenal, it's different, the football is different, there are different players, different ways of playing,"" he said.""At City it was different, the forward didn't touch the ball much, you just have to watch the games to see.""I spoke a lot with Arteta about the style of play. He knows me, I know him, I understood what he wanted from me.""Arteta was a first team coach at City when Jesus joined in 2017, and left for the North Londoners two years later.""Here I'm free on the pitch, playing football with a smile on my face and always trying to give my best,"" said Jesus.After six wins from their seven matches, Arsenal are top of the Premier League ahead of Saturday's North London derby against third-placed Tottenham.Despite his great club form, Jesus was not called up by Brazil coach Tite for September's World Cup warm-up friendlies, a 3-0 win over Ghana and 5-1 thrashing of Tunisia.",2022-10-01

/law-our-rights/rights-advocacy/news/right-the-taxpayers-protect-personal-data-3132286,Right of the taxpayers to protect personal data,"Data protection and privacy are recognised as fundamental rights. An individual's 'private life' includes the protection of his or her personal data. Personal data, in principle, is information that identifies an individual, or is related to the individual. Most of the countries in the world includes a right of privacy in their Constitutions. In many countries, international instruments that recognise privacy rights such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights have been adopted into domestic law.The Finance Act 2022-23 makes compulsory submission of income tax return and obtaining of acknowledgement receipt having information of income, assets and total tax paid etc. for obtaining registration of co-operative society; obtaining or renewal of license or enlistment as a surveyor of general insurance; obtaining registration, by a resident, of the deed of transfer, obtaining or maintaining a credit card; obtaining or continuing the connection of electricity in a city corporation or cantonment board. The acknowledgement receipt form issued by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) is the proof of income tax return submission before a certificate is ready, and it reveals the taxpayer's gross wealth, taxable income and tax paid, inadvertently disclosing such confidential information to third parties. Experts opined that this is a violation of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984 and the draft Income Tax Law 2021. This compulsion of disclosure of private information is against many laws of the country.The Constitution of Bangladesh under article 43 grants every citizen the right, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interests of the security of the state, public order, public morality, or public health, to the privacy of his/her correspondence and other means of communication. The Constitution does not expressly grant the fundamental right to privacy. There are many laws and rules for security of personal data of the citizens, and the government has drafted a Data Protection Law and asked for opinion of different stakeholders. This was recognised by the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in the State v Oli (2019), where the court observed that 'every citizen was entitled to the right to privacy under the Constitution'.Sections 7(h),(i),(j)and (r) of the Right to Information Act provide that any information which may offend the privacy of one's life, any information which may endanger life or physical safety of any person, any information given secretly to assist the law enforcing agencies, or any personal information protected by any law, are not subject to mandatory disclosure by government and certain private organisations. That means anybody cannot get any information regarding privacy or personal data.On the other hand, the information collected by Government is a resource of the citizen and managed on their behalf by Government. There is no general right for people to see the information held by government departments. People should be able to obtain access to these resources and to participate in government policy development and decision making.Freedom of information and privacy Act or Rule aims to ensure that the information collected about people by government agencies is accurate and not misused. People do not have any obligation to disclose their financial situation to even their close ones, but the new finance Act is compelling taxpayers to disclose such sensitive information to unauthorised third parties.The Income Tax Ordinance 1984, under section 163(1) restricts that all particulars or information contained in the following shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed, namely:-(a) any statement made, return furnished or accounts or documents produced under the provisions of this Ordinance; (b) any evidence given, or affidavit or deposition made, in the course of any proceedings under this Ordinance other than proceedings under Chapter XXI; (c) any record of any assessment proceedings or any proceeding relating to the recovery of demand under this Ordinance. Although the tax payer may disclose and sections 163-6 shall not be construed as prohibiting the voluntary disclosure of any particulars referred to in sub-section (1) by the person by whom the statement was made, return furnished, accounts or documents produced, evidence given or affidavit or deposition made, as the case may be.The draft Income Tax Law in chapter 19 and section 297(1) gives priority itself over other laws of the country and declares all the information related to income, expenditure and asset disclosure as prohibited. Even the court is not as such allowed to instruct for presentation of these information under the Evidence Act, 1872. Under section 297(3)(a), the court may requestfor that informationin accordance with the Penal Code, 1860 and the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947.Moreover, the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has launched a digital system to verify the authenticity of tax-return submissions and expedite service delivery by the authorities concerned. Its income-tax wing officially opened the 'tax return verification module' on August 21, 2022. Anyone from across the country can verify the authenticity of the return submission by inserting Taxpayers Identification Number (TIN) in the module, available on the NBR's website. Any other authorities may come into an arrangement with NBR to verify the acknowledgement receipt without disclosing the private data and abide by the different laws ensuring the right to private data of the citizens.It appears that the Finance Act 2022-23 is contradictory to Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and other laws, and this is why, the Finance Act should be amended to protect the private information of the taxpayers. The writer is Non-Government Adviser, Bangladesh Competition Commission.",2022-10-01

She has been collecting the cards every four years since she was ""a little girl,"" she insists, even if galloping inflation in Argentina -- currently at 56 percent -- does not make that easy.""Argentina is nearly always in an economic crisis,"" shrugged the shop owner, Leila Edul. ""But now, with these stickers... money somehow appears out of nowhere.""That is true despite the soaring price of a packet since the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

""There is such fervor -- it's packed every weekend.""Raul Vallecillo, a Panini official in Chile, said Latin American sales have exceeded the expectations of the Italian manufacturer, which published its first album for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico.Chile's national team did not qualify for this year's World Cup, which opens in Qatar in November, yet Panini sold in a single month the stock it had expected to last four months, he said. The same trend holds in Venezuela, Colombia and Peru, all of which also failed to qualify, he said.Vallecillo said the infatuation with the cards is heightened by the likelihood that this will be the last appearance of aging superstars like Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as well as the hope the Argentine or Brazilian side will be able to break the European teams' 20-year stranglehold on the championship.Street vendorsIn Sao Paulo, collectors have been gathering outside the Football Museum.Forty-year-old Leandro Fonseca is on the hunt for some special-edition stickers, including some with Neymar's image, which have been selling on the internet for hundreds of dollars.""I'm off to a late start on the 'extras,' but I hope to fill 20 albums, he said.

Other lesser stars from the Uruguayan, Argentine or Brazilian sides go for 20 to 50 pesos, while still others go for just 10 pesos (though a star like France's Kylian Mbappe brings in 50 pesos).Guillermo Orcile has been helping his seven-year-old son Salvador complete his album entirely through trades.""It's important that he understand how trading works, which makes these albums important,"" he said.""Because if it's just about buying, then the spirit is lost.""",2022-10-02

""This imported government must see Imran's power.""He was of the view that lawyers, peasants, labourers, students, youth as well as the whole of Pakistan would take to the streets once the party leader gave the date for his long march.He said it would now be the PTI's turn to file cases based on ""truth and facts"", adding the government won't be able to lodge cases anymore.CONTEMPT CASEThe decision to initiate contempt proceedings against Imran was taken by the IHC's Justice Aamer Farooq on August 22 while hearing a petition challenging Gill's police remand. The court had summoned Imran on August 31 and subsequently issued him a show-cause notice.A day before the hearing, the former prime minister had submitted a reply before the IHC wherein he had expressed his willingness to ""take back"" his words about Judge Chaudhry if they were ""regarded as inappropriate"". He had pleaded before the IHC that the judges who had agreed to initiate the case against him should consider withdrawing themselves from the bench as, according to him, they had pre-judged the matter.However, the IHC had deemed the response to be ""unsatisfactory"" and asked the PTI chief to submit a ""well-considered"" response.Following this, Imran had submitted another reply to the court. In the revised response, Imran had stopped short of rendering an unconditional apology.On September 8, the IHC had decided to indict Imran, once again calling his response ""unsatisfactory"".However, at the next hearing on September 22, when it was expected that charges would be framed against the PTI chief, Imran had offered to tender an apology to Judge Chaudhry and escaped the indictment.Following his statement in the court, the larger bench hearing the case had said that it was ""satisfied"" with the apology and asked the PTI chief to submit an affidavit.Prior to submitting the affidavit, Imran on Friday appeared before an Islamabad sessions court to personally apologise to Judge Chaudhry, but his apology was left hanging as the judge was on leave.Meanwhile, in his affidavit, Imran said he had ""realised during these (contempt) proceedings before the honourable court that he might have crossed a red line"". However, he added, he never intended to threaten Judge Chaudhry and ""there was no intention behind the statement to take any action other than legal action"".He said he wanted to assure the IHC that he was willing to explain and clarify before Judge Chaudhry that"" neither he nor his party seeks/sought any action"" against her and he was willing to apologise to her ""if she got an impression that the deponent (Imran) had crossed a line"".He also expressed his willingness to take any further steps that the IHC ""deems necessary and appropriate for the satisfaction of the honourable court that he never intended to interfere in the process of the court or impugn the dignity or independence of the judiciary"".Copyright: Dawn/Asia News Network",2022-10-02

/environment/climate-change/news/labour-productivity-hit-extreme-temperatures-dhaka-loses-6b-year-3133096,Extreme heat: $6b loss a year in Dhaka’s labour productivity,"Dhaka is losing $6 billion worth of labour productivity each year due to heat stress from extreme temperatures, said a study published yesterday.This amounts up to 8 percent of the annual labour output in Dhaka, said the study published by the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center, a joint initiative of The Rockefeller Foundation and philanthropist Adrienne Arsht.The study compared 12 cities across the globe and found that in Dhaka heat impairs labour productivity more than any other city.The other cities studied include New Delhi, Athens, Buenos Aires, Freetown, London, Los Angeles, Miami, Monterrey, Santiago and Sydney.The study titled ""Hot Cities, Chilled Economies: Impacts of Extreme Heat on Global Cities"" said unless measures were taken to reduce global warming, the loss will rise to 10 percent by 2050.This is the highest share of losses of any city in this study, it added. ""While others such as Abu Dhabi and Bangkok are more exposed to heat stress, Dhaka is unusually vulnerable to its effects, due to its labour-intensive economy and low rate of active cooling,"" said the report.""Despite the already high temperatures and humidity of between 60 and 80 percent in Dhaka, climate change is set to make things substantially worse.""Because of the unchecked warming, sectors such as manufacturing loses $1.5 billion while logistics loses $1.8 billion yearly.The report states that in Dhaka, for the 10 hottest days of a typical year, the apparent temperature (considering both heat and humidity) is hotter than the human body.In 2020, Dhaka experienced 36.5 days in which the 24-hour average temperature was more than 28.8 degree Celsius. By 2050, this could rise to 69.8 days.The surface of roads can currently reach up to 60 degree Celsius, found the report.""Large and widespread hotspots within the city are more than 10 degree Celsius higher than the surrounding countryside.""The heat impacts the poor disproportionately, said the report.""The highest worker productivity-related economic losses from the heat are felt by those least able to bear them. In sectors such as garment manufacturing, transport, and retail trade, where wages can be lower than average, losses already amount to around 10 percent of income.""Losses in manufacturing are likely to be particularly high in sectors such as garment manufacturing or brick making, where proximity to machinery or ovens increases the temperature to which workers are exposed, said the report.It said that heat is concentrated in some of the city's poorest areas.""In Kamrangirchar, an area containing a high concentration of informal settlements with widespread use of corrugated iron sheet roofing, temperatures are typically 12 degree Celsius higher than Dhaka's surroundings.""Such temperatures lead to health risks, it added.""The world is burning. Unfortunately, that's not an exaggeration. Climate-driven heat is changing the way we live and work,"" commented the report.Ashraf Dewan, a professor at School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Curtin University, Australia, had earlier studied urban heat islands and how the temperature of Dhaka has risen over the decades.""Urban heat islands are places whose temperature is hotter than the surrounding areas. In Dhaka, temperature is sporadically felt differently in different places,"" said Dewan.""The poorest areas are hotter because of lack of greenery and the use of corrugated iron sheets. These trap heat during the day, and do not radiate heat fast enough at night. Since these areas are surrounded by high-rise buildings that do not facilitate wind flow, the air gets trapped,"" he explained.""Water bodies used to cool down the city. But we don't have water bodies anymore. In addition, the reliance on air conditioners lead to heat being dispensed into the surrounding air.""Furthermore, glass buildings aggravate urban heat islands – they let in heat and light during the day but they need more air conditioners for cooling.""Professor Dewan said that the easiest and cost-effective solution is to plant more trees – they do not let the air temperature rise.",2022-10-02

/sports/football/news/perez-insisting-european-super-league-3133381,Perez insisting on European Super League,"Real Madrid president Florentino Perez again insisted on the idea of a European Super League when speaking at a club members assembly on Sunday.In April 2021 a dozen of Europe's biggest clubs signed up to a controversial new project but it crumbled after a strong backlash from supporters and football's governing bodies.Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus stayed on board while other clubs abandoned ship and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg (CJEU) is to rule over whether European football governing body UEFA is acting as a monopoly by blocking the project.""The Super League has never been closed off with a concrete format,"" Perez told Madrid members. ""We think that it could change depending on different contexts.""The objective of the Super League is to modernise football. It is essential to offer fans games of great quality. UEFA, with their changing and remodelling of the Champions League is mistakenly going the other way.""The Real Madrid chief compared football to tennis, where the top players usually face each other multiple times a year.""What sense does it have depriving fans of big games?"" he asked.

/opinion/views/news/kennans-1946-long-telegram-moscow-it-relevant-beijing-3133376,Kennan’s 1946 ‘Long Telegram’ from Moscow: Is it relevant for Beijing?,"On February 22, 1946, George Kennan, American chargé d'affaires in Moscow, sent an 8,000-word-long telegram to his State Department bosses. Later known as the ""Long Telegram"", it became the most influential foreign policy paper for dealing with the communist state. It helped articulate the US government's increasingly hard line against the Soviets and became the basis of the US Cold War policy toward the Soviet Union. In 1947, Kennan wrote an article titled, ""The Sources of Soviet Conduct"", arguing that its regime was inherently expansionist and that its influence had to be ""contained"". It deeply influenced President Truman who adopted a ""containment policy"" to stop Soviet communism's expansion. Kennan argued for isolating the Soviet Union and waiting for it to fall under its own weight, which it eventually did in 1991.Meanwhile, in 1978, China launched its economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping. Riding on its economic success, Beijing bolstered its military muscle as well. Xi Jinping, after becoming China's president in 2012, undertook renewed measures to build an army to ""fight and win"" global wars. In 2013, he launched the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to build large infrastructures in Asia, Africa, Europe, and other regions.The rise of an assertive Beijing alarmed Washington. In 2015, President Barack Obama undertook a rebalancing of power toward Asia. Containing China became America's major policy issue. In December 2017, the US declared China's rise a military threat and launched the China containment policy by borrowing a page from Kennan's playbook.The policy extended to the tech sector as well. In 2012, an American congressional investigation concluded that the equipment of Huawei, a Chinese tech giant, could pose a threat to US interests. Accordingly, President Obama banned companies from using Huawei's products. Biden intensified the tech war by including semiconductors in it. Washington also persuaded its allies to adopt the same policy towards Beijing's tech initiatives, turning it into a global tech war. Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act in August to increase American hold on the semiconductor industry. He also launched the Chip 4 initiative involving Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, with an express aim of keeping China out of this crucial technology.The China containment policy has thus taken deep roots following Kennan's anti-Soviet postulations. But will what worked against the Soviets also apply to China? On the surface, there are some similarities between the two; both are under authoritarian regimes, and both are founded on the same communist idea. But there are some striking dissimilarities too.Kennan aptly noted that the Soviet leadership perceived itself at perpetual war with capitalism. The Soviets did not see the possibility of any peaceful coexistence with the capitalist world, and they persistently aimed at advancing the socialist cause. There was nothing in capitalism they could adopt. China, in sharp contrast, did see the benefits of a market economy and used it to its benefit. It opened up international trade and foreign investment and did everything required to take advantage of capitalism's strengths.Second, China has a long tradition of doing business with adversaries which its rich silk road history shows. As the ancient traders embarked on perilous journeys through the tribal territories in Central Asia, Chinese emperors didn't attempt to bring those territories under their total control. Instead, they made trade more attractive to the tribes than looting or war. The same game is being played today, as Beijing aggressively pushes ahead with its BRI projects. The 11,000 km long train route linking China's Chongqing with Germany's Duisburg, which opened in August 2012, is carrying tens of thousands of containers each year (currently, an alternative route is used bypassing Russia due to the Ukraine war).Third, China is intricately connected to the international trade and economic system, making it almost impossible to isolate it without harming the global economy. It became the world's largest exporter of goods in 2009, and the largest trading nation in 2013. In 2017, its share of global goods trade rose to 11.4 percent (from 1.9 percent in 2000). It is also the largest export destination for 33 countries and the largest source of imports for 65. It received the second largest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from 2015 to 2017. China was also the world's second-largest source of outbound FDI over the same period. In 2019, 1.2 million American jobs depended on exports to China of which 245,000 were lost after the start of the trade war. China accounts for a third of Germany's car sales. Almost 40 percent of Australian exports go to China. Beijing controls 90 percent of the supply of processed rare earth minerals that is essential for refining petroleum and making advanced weaponry, high-end electronics, electric vehicles, and wind turbines without which the modern economy will crumble.Unlike the Soviet Union, China is a peer of the US in economic might with increasing tech and military muscle. History has repeatedly shown that wars that were expected to be short and decisive ended up being long and protracted, severely draining both sides. Washington and Beijing know enough to realise that war is not a viable option, but coexistence is. Both sides need to consider the other's realities and reign in the proponents of a war that will be unimaginably disastrous. And finally, each has its history, domestic issues, and political conviction. Understanding that is one good step towards modus vivendi, or coexistence.Dr Sayeed Ahmed is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation.",2022-10-02

/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/shohel-mondol-actor-born-3133336,Shohel Mondol: An actor is born,"Shohel Mondol — an award winner at the Blender's Choice-The Daily Star OTT & Digital Content Awards 2021 gets nostalgic as we were discussing how he developed his penchant for acting. Mondol claims that he used to be an ""introvert"" while growing up in the beautiful pastoral set-up of Dhunat, an upazila in Bogura, a major district in Rajshahi division in northern Bangladesh. His ancestral village is situated in that upazila. While he considers himself to be blessed to have grown up in an extended family, he was not too keen in mingling with his boisterous gang of cousins. To stay away from all the hullabaloo, he would often resort to books.""Books for me were the ultimate saviour as they used to transport me to a different world, a world full of fantasy! I used to immerse myself in those books' pages and embark on a journey,"" says Shohel Mondol.  Sitting inside the makeup room of a studio, there is no power and the newly bought generator at the studio building is not functioning. The room has no window to allow any daylight. There is this eerie darkness all around us with the torchlight of my mobile phone being the only source of light.""It never crossed my mind that someday I too can become an actor. I just wanted to read and set on a journey with the characters depicted in those stories. As I grow up, besides books, watching movies in a nearby cinema hall started to become my favourite pastime,"" Shohel continues.He was one of those lucky 90s kids who would frequent cinema halls to watch movies of late heroes like Salman Shah or Manna.""The social drama and action of those heroes fascinated me; although I never wanted to be like them. It was purely for entertainment purposes,"" he clarifies. After moving to Dhaka, Shohel met with a new bunch of friends. There too, he started having that feeling of not fitting well. He could not resonate with the topics his friends were discussing. He was looking for an escape route.The bookstalls of Nilkhet saved him from the ultimate boredom. He started buying books and reading those to feed his soul that was hungry to go on expeditions with various characters.""I don't remember who actually introduced me to the idea of watching a stage performance. I started attending theatre shows. Eventually I developed an urge to meet the actors face to face. I even used to stand at the gate of FDC to have a glimpse of the heroes and heroines,"" Shohel chuckles and gives me a look as if I was going to judge him for doing so.He absolutely loved the performances in theatres and one day he discovered that he could join the troops and learn acting.""My ultimate intention was to see the performers up close. So, I joined 'Nagorik Natyongon Institute of Drama', where I was trained and got the opportunity to work at Nagorik Natyangan for two years. After that I joined Prachyanat School of Acting & Design for further schooling. I have been working with them for the last 12-13 years.""""So, theatre helped you overcome the shyness?"" I asked.""Oh yes, big time. I owe it to my teachers, co-performers and friends for my ultimate metamorphosis in all these years and I am grateful to Prachyanat,"" he says. As our chit chat continues, I keep looking at my watch as the studio owner said the loadshedding in Niketan usually continues for 10-15 minutes. It has been half an hour and we both are sweating profusely. I am relieved that Shohel did not get fussy at all sitting in that condition. As I keep apologising for the situation, Shohel assures me that he is ok.""I think having a more considerate approach to situations we face in everyday life makes our living easier. I can adapt very easily with any situation; which probably also helped me in acting,"" Mondol adds.The young actor has already received much accolades for the different types of characters he has portrayed on screen so far. So, is there any character that he is yearning to portray at present? Shohel says, ""I would love to do a so-called masala film, the ones I grew up watching. This kind of films has a mass appeal and they are needed for the industry to sustain. Having said that, the new breed of directors is making us hopeful and I am grateful to be a part of this momentum.""At that point of our discussion, the power comes back. The lights are on, so is the aircon. Shohel sits for his makeup and our conversation continues.""Are you always this easy going,"" I ask him, directly. With his signature heart-warming smile Shohel says that he always appreciates honesty and transparency in every situation.""I can sense if someone is being dishonest with me; I am definitely not going to be cooperative in those situations. However, if I am having a mood swing, I try to stay aloof and reflect on the situation or the role I am going to play. I definitely put much effort to understand the character on the script,"" the versatile actor elaborates.So, would you call yourself moody? When asked, Shohel replies: ""I give a lot of preference to my mood. What many audiences don't  know is that I worked as a full-time video editor for several renowned projects. My mood at the time of editing certainly reflected on the colour corrections of the footages.""We are almost at the end of our interview. The set is ready. Our makeup man Hossain too does a decent job in hiding Shohel's grey hairs which will somehow conflict with the look and get up we thought for him on the mood board. Before we start the shoot, I throw my last question to him — ""Any big plans this year?""""See, I don't plan that much. I am going to do this new web series which will be featured on an international OTT platform. One of my earlier work, Mayar Janjal which I did with Aupee Karim, my most favourite actor gets released this year. This makes me happy. Earlier I didn't have much choice, but now since people are recognising my work, I am getting to choose the roles, particularly which are more contemporary or challenging in nature to portray. That's all,"" he concludes with his charming smile. Model: Shohel Mondol

/daily-star-books/news/rising-dollar-prices-impact-book-trade-3133321,Rising dollar prices impact book trade ,"With the price of paper rising worldwide, the prices of printed books, magazines, and newspapers too are increasing rapidly. Printed books are becoming inaccessible to readers. As a result, publishers are fearing that the number of readers as well as buyers will gradually decrease. The rise in dollar prices is a major reason, driven by the post-pandemic situation and the Russia-Ukraine war. Publishers in some countries have even stopped publishing books. The most crucial time to sell books in Bangladesh is during the Amar Ekushey Book Fair in February, preparations for which are underway right now. Although the paper for books is produced in the country, the mills are dependent for their supply of ink and plate on foreign raw materials. The price of books is thus subject to increase. Mofiuddin, proprietor of Amanot Trade—a paper dealer in the capital's Nayabazar area— told The Daily Star, ""The price of paper was stable during the pandemic, but the recent hike in the price of a dollar has caused the price of paper to increase too much. If one rim (item) of local paper was earlier priced at BDT 1,300, the current price is BDT 1,900; glossy sticker paper was BDT 2,000, now it is BDT 3,000. Carbon paper was priced at BDT 2,400, now it is BDT 3,300; foreign offset was BDT 3,500, it is BDT 4,850 at present. This is happening due to the price of paper fluctuating with dollar prices.""""Everytime there is a hike in the price of paper, we have to adjust things and that results in readers having to bear the extra cost. This is happening everywhere—people have to buy their daily necessities at a higher price, meaning that they are less likely to buy books"", said Mahrukh Mohiuddin, Managing Director of The University Press Limited (UPL). ""This will dampen people's motivation to publish books. I think the overall crisis will have a negative impact. Won't this naturally lead to the erosion of our intellectual practices?"" she asks. Shahidul Islam Biju, owner of Pathak Shamabesh bookstore, shares, ""We haven't yet raised the price of books even though prices of everything in the country, including printing and paper, have soared up. We have to consider these things while reprinting books. Prices of foreign books have also gone up. We have maintained our old prices so far, for the sake of our readers. But I don't know if we'll be able to continue this.""The trend seems to be apparent worldwide. Publishers Weekly cited in February that the US based publication giant Ingram is going to increase the overall price of a book by six percent. Front Edge Publishing's supply chain uses Ingram's Lightning Source system. This is a global network of book production which distributes books to readers from North America to all around the globe. According to Janice Butler, senior manager of Ingram Content Group, Russia is an important source of timber for Europe, and since the invasion of Ukraine, this trade has completely stopped. And one of the materials for making paper is wood. The Times of India similarly reports increases in the price of paper affecting the Bangla publishing industry in West Bengal as the input costs—paper, ink, binding materials, and transport costs—have increased. In Pakistan, meanwhile, a report by The News says that the price of paper has more than doubled across the country due to their government's lack of interest in stabilising prices. Aziz Khalid, chairman of the Pakistan Publishers and Booksellers Association, pointed out that no paper is available for the publication of Sindh Text Book Board books. Writer Ahmad Mustafa Kamal tells The Daily Star, ""For those who read books, reading is not just a luxury, but a part of their life. It is an indispensable tool to lead a healthy life. Food prices are increasing, travel costs are increasing, medicine prices are increasing, which means everything is spiralling out of control now. How will we survive if this continues?""Translated by Maisha Syeda and Hrishik Roy.

/opinion/in-focus/news/gandhis-sojourn-noakhali-3133786,Gandhi’s sojourn in Noakhali,"There are many ways a nation's history can be understood, for it has many points, opinions, and arguments depending on the sources one can reach. To comprehend history, scholars have recently started turning to memories in their efforts to make sense of the past. On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on October 2, we can take the opportunity to examine the memories of his visit to Noakhali to remember the ""champion of non-violence.""Memories are being used as a tool to reconstruct the past, as much it was imagined as it transpired. This article is aimed at seeing Gandhi's visit through recollection, commemoration, and social manners and mores. It is a repertoire of interests, and collective mentality about the local history of India's partition. Gandhi's Noakhali visit in 1946 was rarely examined directly through collective memory, neglected as just a case study that fails to reveal the long-lasting legacy Gandhi left behind, as can be found in the oral recollections of the villagers in Noakhali.Gandhi's sojourn in Noakhali sparked many political debates and opinions, alleging him of downplaying the cause of the Muslims, who were victimised by the communal riots in Bihar that erupted immediately after the violence in Noakhali. However, Gandhi intended to heal the communal scars in the Muslim society in Noakhali, aiming to set an example for the rest of India of how Hindus and Muslims can get along. However, while relevant, the focus of this piece is not the political agenda of the time, but rather the local history of Noakhali during Gandhi's visit, and how he was mainly seen from the Muslim perspective and is still remembered in the community by people who had no political affiliations and ambitions.Hindu-Muslim relationships in Noakhali in late 1930s
Before delving into the memories of Gandhi's visit to Noakhali, let us have an overview of the Hindu-Muslim relationships in the area the decade before. The relationship took a hit when Khitish Babu, a schoolteacher in Lamchar, Noakhali, who happened to be Hindu, called his Class 7 student, who was Muslim, haramjada (bastard). This was an offensive to Muslims, especially coming from someone who was Hindu. Following that, a large meeting was called by Golam Sarwar, the local MLA and a Muslim political leader, in Lamchar on April 12, 1939. Sarwar protested this incident and was agitated about how Hindus dared rebuke a Mohammedan student with this filthy language. He asked for an apology from the school authorities and said he would go on a strike at the school otherwise. He further threatened the teacher by dragging him round the street with shoes around his neck – an unimaginable insult for a teacher.



A Congress leader from the Hindu community at the time, Monoranjan Chowdhury, wrote a letter to Gandhi regarding this communal propaganda spread by Sarwar, and requested him to take immediate steps. He was angry that Hindus in Noakhali were switching from Congress to Hindu Mahasabha. What wasn't mentioned in the letter was that the Congress leader had also made references and an allegation of Bengal Muslim leaders failing to check the communal tensions, which was featured in the local newspaper. One particular point the newspaper addressed was about Sandwip, Noakhali, where, for 12 years, an agreement was in place between the two communities. This agreement stated that Hindu processions could pass in front of mosques, playing music, except during prayer hours. In 1939, on the Bijaya Dashami Day, the local Hindus employed the agreement. But the sub-deputy collector and circle officer-in-charge wrote to Babu Rajendralal Nag, BL on October 21, 1939, ""I consider it my duty to let you know and you are probably aware that a civil tumult may arise if music is played near the mosque at any hour on the Dashera Day.""
""There was a time when Indian Musselman used to listen to me, but now (they) regard me as their enemy number one. I worked with the Ali brothers, Azmal Khan, and many others for years. I tell you; I am not an enemy of anybody on Earth. I am a servant of God, i.e. truth.""



There was an allegation about Krishak Samitis as well. Hindu leaders demanded for the appointment of a committee of inquiry to look into the cases of communal tensions and violence. In response, the then Home Minister Sir Nazimuddin insinuated that there was no precedent condition to such inquiry. He said all the issues they lamented about were false, baseless, and malicious – an attempt was made to malign this government without any reason whatsoever. He claimed that it was a ploy of Hindu zamindars and mahajans, whose illegal exactions had been checked by the Krishak Samitis of the district. No immediate response from Gandhi was found in 1939 concerning the problem, making it more difficult to assume whether he took time to go over the letters sent from Noakhali. However, he responded by visiting the district in 1946, indicating that he was aware of the situation and the growing differences between the two groups. To bring the community together during the riots and before partition, Gandhi travelled to Noakhali with his ""peace mission,"" an idea that can be used interchangeably with non-violence.

Remembering Gandhi
Memories endure only within the social context that they were created in, with communities largely defining the conceptual structures that individuals use to recall information. The socially acquired understanding of the past is a patchwork of personal reminiscences constructed and pieced together within this social dimension (Hayden White: 1987). Thus, the relationship between memory and an understanding of history through social context is one of mutual influence, both parts greatly effecting and relying upon the other. Regarding the individual memories of Gandhi, I took oral interviews in the places Gandhi visited in 1946. The attempt was to retrieve individual perspectives on Gandhi, which coalesced into an image. One of the people that I interviewed, Motalleb Patwary, who is now 88 years old with a round wrinkled face and a goatee, shared, ""There were no places left untouched by the rioters in Chandpur. While the whole place was aflame, there were no human casualties. Immediately after the riots, the Gurkha Army first came to our area. Then, Gandhi arrived with his two granddaughters, and his message was calming and noble. Gandhi spoke to the mass people in a comforting tone. Nothing was out of order. He tried to make the communities understand that we, Hindus and Muslims, were brothers. There was no point of fighting each other. We were trying to drive out the British rulers; while they were leaving, they made us fight one another."" Patwary and his maternal cousin joined Gandhi's prayer meetings. He also added that there was no one in the village who did not attend the meetings; everyone, young and old, was there.

As the interview went on, Patwary also mentioned, ""Everyone was waiting for him to come. There was a whole sea of people."" Despite the issue of riots which was what Gandhi was trying to address, Gandhi the individual became a hot topic in the community. Because of the poor communication system back then, the roads Gandhi travelled were renovated by filling ditches, and bridges were made where needed. An air of festivity had settled in the area. The news of his visit led to the resolution of a lot of issues. People who were forcefully converted to Islam became Hindu again. More importantly, the perpetrators of the riots went into hiding, while many of them went to apologise to the Hindus. Patwary's experience resonates with Tofael Ahamad, who was, then, a student at Chatkhil Panchgaon Government High School. He wrote in his book, ""'Let's go see Gandhi,'saying this, we ran"" [Mahatma Gandhi in Bangladesh (East Bengal), Dhaka: Panchgaon Prokashoni, 1992, P. 1-5]. He further described that it was not more than a quarter of a mile from his house where Gandhi came – a 10-minute walking distance. His aura was powerful, and it seemed like Ahmad needed to see him and attend his meeting. Even though he didn't like who Gandhi was and why he came, he still felt an urge to see him.
Gandhi's sojourn in Noakhali sparked many political debates and opinions, alleging him of downplaying the cause of the Muslims, who were victimised by the communal riots in Bihar that erupted immediately after the violence in Noakhali. However, Gandhi intended to heal the communal scars in the Muslim society in Noakhali.
Noni Bala Bonik was protected by her Muslim neighbours. She was 90 at the time of the interview, but had sharp and detailed memories on Gandhi. She recalled, ""Gandhi came like a messenger and set up some temporary camps. I attended his prayer meetings twice and received chocolates."" For Noni Bala and other Hindus, Gandhi appeared like a saviour after the riots, as everyone assumed that since he was around, nobody would have the courage to unleash violence again. After Gandhi's assassination, Noni Bala and her family members lived in anxiety for days fearing that riots may break out again. But nothing happened.
Whatever the Hindu or Muslim positions were in Noakhali seven decades ago, Gandhi was able to bring the community together. Sumit Sarkar defined it as Gandh's ""finest hour."" The principal of Chaumani College, Tafazzal Husain, equated Gandhi with a prophet. Gandhi wrote a letter to Husain and shared his emotion. ""There was a time when Indian Musselman used to listen to me, but now (they) regard me as their enemy number one. I worked with the Ali brothers, Azmal Khan, and many others for years. I tell you; I am not an enemy of anybody on Earth. I am a servant of God, i.e. truth. I shall stick to this job till I die, or someone kills me (Smritikana (Bits of Memory) (Dhaka: 1978), P. 83)"" His statement revealed the internal conflict he had been going through before the partition. He wanted to return to Noakhali after the partition and spend the rest of his life with the Muslim community. More importantly, he compared riots with cancer, which needed to heal before it spread to the whole body of Indian polity. He said prevention was better than cure. Noakhali gave him the opportunity to set an example of communal harmony for the entire Indian subcontinent.
 







Gandhi Monument at Joyag, Noakhali.
Gandhi's monument
The Gandhi Ashram Trust, a philanthropic organisation in Noakhali, built a monument to convey Mahatma Gandhi's legacy and memories to the next generation. One can see the 20-foot, white stone sculpture of Gandhi standing upon a plinth and welcoming visitors. He is shown holding a walking stick in one hand, his other hand gently at his side. The statue is surrounded by a gorgeous garden of all sorts of trees and foliage. The image is simple and inviting, while still conveying the power of Gandhi's presence. It was built to commemorate Gandhi and the history of riots in Noakhali. This monument connects us to the history and power of resistance to violence as well as a willingness to reject riots. It always sparks a conversation among people and a broader public image which unites the community.
A monument is the embodiment of memories, a place bridging different generations. It helps us rethink the past that it perpetuates. Moreover, it is a constant dialogue between past and present, based upon which we can make decisions for the future. Gandhi's monument in Noakhali reveals the past to which we belong and how to learn from it. It also speaks to the community's crisis, trauma, and grief. Gandhi's legacy will continue in Noakhali through his monument, and let people understand the flag of peace he sailed with on his journey throughout Noakhali.

One can see the 20-foot, white stone sculpture of Gandhi standing upon a plinth and welcoming visitors. He is shown holding a walking stick in one hand, his other hand gently at his side. The statue is surrounded by a gorgeous garden of all sorts of trees and foliage. The image is simple and inviting, while still conveying the power of Gandhi's presence. It was built to commemorate Gandhi and the history of riots in Noakhali. This monument connects us to the history and power of resistance to violence as well as a willingness to reject riots. It always sparks a conversation among people and a broader public image which unites the community.
A monument is the embodiment of memories, a place bridging different generations. It helps us rethink the past that it perpetuates. Moreover, it is a constant dialogue between past and present, based upon which we can make decisions for the future. Gandhi's monument in Noakhali reveals the past to which we belong and how to learn from it. It also speaks to the community's crisis, trauma, and grief. Gandhi's legacy will continue in Noakhali through his monument, and let people understand the flag of peace he sailed with on his journey throughout Noakhali.

Gandhi's sojourn in Noakhali sparked many political debates and opinions, alleging him of downplaying the cause of the Muslims, who were victimised by the communal riots in Bihar that erupted immediately after the violence in Noakhali. However, Gandhi intended to heal the communal scars in the Muslim society in Noakhali.Noni Bala Bonik was protected by her Muslim neighbours. She was 90 at the time of the interview, but had sharp and detailed memories on Gandhi. She recalled, ""Gandhi came like a messenger and set up some temporary camps. I attended his prayer meetings twice and received chocolates."" For Noni Bala and other Hindus, Gandhi appeared like a saviour after the riots, as everyone assumed that since he was around, nobody would have the courage to unleash violence again. After Gandhi's assassination, Noni Bala and her family members lived in anxiety for days fearing that riots may break out again. But nothing happened.Whatever the Hindu or Muslim positions were in Noakhali seven decades ago, Gandhi was able to bring the community together. Sumit Sarkar defined it as Gandh's ""finest hour."" The principal of Chaumani College, Tafazzal Husain, equated Gandhi with a prophet. Gandhi wrote a letter to Husain and shared his emotion. ""There was a time when Indian Musselman used to listen to me, but now (they) regard me as their enemy number one. I worked with the Ali brothers, Azmal Khan, and many others for years. I tell you; I am not an enemy of anybody on Earth. I am a servant of God, i.e. truth. I shall stick to this job till I die, or someone kills me (Smritikana (Bits of Memory) (Dhaka: 1978), P. 83)"" His statement revealed the internal conflict he had been going through before the partition. He wanted to return to Noakhali after the partition and spend the rest of his life with the Muslim community. More importantly, he compared riots with cancer, which needed to heal before it spread to the whole body of Indian polity. He said prevention was better than cure. Noakhali gave him the opportunity to set an example of communal harmony for the entire Indian subcontinent.Gandhi's monument

/news/bangladesh/news/new-horizon-climate-research-3133741,New horizon in climate research,"Climate Technology Park, launched on Saturday in Gazipur's Sripur upazila, is set to open a new horizon in adaptation research to tackle the impacts of climate change.The centre was built by Christian Commission for the Development of Bangladesh (CCDB), with financial support from German-based donor agency Brot Fur Die Welt (Bread for the World).Minister of Agriculture Muhammad Abdur Razzaque inaugurated the facility.""The centre will bring a radical change in the country's fight against climate change,"" he said.""Gazipur was renowned for its sprawling Sal forest. However, that is old history now. The destruction of the forest reserves is one of the major causes behind global warming and climate change. The more the deforestation, the more the natural calamities,"" he added.Those involved with the facility said this centre will address the knowledge gap, lack of climate technologies and action research to create contextual solution to the climate crisis through engaging academia, researchers, affected communities, development practitioners and policy makers.The centre was built in an area of 30 acres and has five ecological zones, including a haor region, a dry region, Char areas, hilly areas and a coastal zone, illustrating the resilience mechanism of each zone.Climate expert Saleemul Huq told The Daily Star that there are different activities going on in different regions.One of the key features of the facility is that it has five different ecosystem zones in display, where one can easily get a picture of what kind of impact each zone is facing.""Global researchers will come here to see how we are coping with the impacts of climate change. They will share their knowledge and learn from our resilience strategies,"" he said.The state-of-art facility will mainstream the transformative community-led adaptation and climate risk reduction by accelerating innovation, capacity development and knowledge dissemination, said CCDB Executive Director Juliate Keya Malakar.""It is our dream that this centre will now start supporting us, the communities we work with, and the country, in shaping our common future in climate resilience and zero carbon emission pathways"", she said.The facility also has 70 practical technologies that are effective in adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction.It also accommodates a climate learning centre, digital theatre, exhibition zone, conference hall, library, research centre and young learners' zone within the 30-acre area.While visiting the facility, Thomas Hirsch, policy advisor from Climate and Development Advice, a Germany-based organisation, said Bangladesh is among the five most vulnerable nations in terms of climate change.""This facility was designed in a way to bring together different stakeholders to develop the solution that Bangladesh needs. This centre will be a hub of knowledge exchange not only in Bangladesh but also within South Asia. German and American scientists will come here to help find better solutions as well,"" he said.Petra Berner, director international (programme) of Bread for the World, said the idea of the centre was conceived in 2012 and it was a long journey to get here.""The idea behind building such a facility came from the ideas about what can be done to fight the impact of climate change. It will serve as a centre to connect the knowledge produced by the local community to the experts to strengthen the climate resilience mechanism,"" she said. The arrangement for a guided tour to take a look at the various zones can be availed by any visitor, she added.",2022-10-03

Rony will be discharged from Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery after Puja.Earlier on, Rony was shifted from the High Dependency Unit (HDU) to a cabin. He is currently able to walk and eat properly. The doctors have been hopeful that they will be able to release him soon. However, Rony will still have to visit the hospital for regular checkups, due to the severity of his injuries.On September 16, Abu Hena Rony and four other policemen were severely burnt during a gas balloon explosion, at the anniversary celebration of Gazipur Metropolitan Police. The injured were initially taken to Gazipur Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmad Medical College Hospital. Rony and Zillur Rahman, a policeman, were later sent to Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery, as the severity of their burn injuries was much higher.On September 17, Dr Samanta Lal Sen—coordinator of Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery—informed The Daily Star that Rony had suffered 25 percent burns, while policeman Zillur Rahman had suffered 19 percent burns. They were both kept at the HDU after their wounds had been dressed. ",2022-10-03

However, she refuses to open up about recent events.Did you go to Kolkata to celebrate Puja?Yes, I am here with my son Joy and my sister – we are staying at my aunt's house. We are spending a wonderful time here, even though we did not have the time to meet all our relatives.How are you spending the holidays there?
We went to many places for sightseeing and shopping. There is a place called Rajbari, where one of the most beautiful and elaborate Puja mandaps are made. I went there this time.



Kolkata, at this time of the year, is absolutely beautiful. The decorations, the music, the smell of vegetarian food – they all resonate in a splendid manner.
Do you go to Kolkata every year for Puja?
Not really, we have come here after many years. Usually, I spend time in Bangladesh with friends and family.



When I was little, I used to come here with my parents. My father used to tell me to hold his hand, or else I would get lost! His words still ring in my ears.

/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/us-watching-processes-free-fair-polls-3133851,"US watching processes to free, fair polls","Out of the five largest economies in the world today, three -- China (2), Japan (3) and India (5) -- are in Asia. The robust economic growth of Asian giants, China in particular, is rapidly reshaping the global distribution of power. With the global power shifting to Asia, the world's number one power USA rushes to join the geopolitical game, in which Bangladesh too, is likely to get pulled into.   Peter D Haas, the new US ambassador, who has been openly critical of human rights violations, accountability of Rab, political violence, touched on a few thorny points in an exclusive written interview with The Daily Star recently.The Daily Star (DS): Based on the solid foundation built between the two countries over the last 50 years, how do you see the future relationship of Bangladesh and the US? What are the elements needed to improve the relationship?Peter Haas (PH): I am amazed at just how much Bangladesh has accomplished over these 50 years and proud of the support the United States has provided to the Bangladeshi people and its government. We have collaborated across many sectors, and I predict that over the next 50 years, our partnership will become even stronger.The United States will continue to work with Bangladesh and build on the progress we have made together in food security, health, and reducing poverty. We will also identify new and innovative approaches to address issues like climate change, promoting democratic principles, increasing trade, and sustaining Bangladesh's impressive economic growth.  I am extremely optimistic about our future together. DS: What is the latest US position, 10 months after the sanctions on Rab? Is Washington satisfied with the measures already taken by Dhaka?  Specifically, what more is required?PH: The US Department of Treasury is the lead agency for sanctions-related matters.  For that Department to consider lifting sanctions, there must be accountability (i.e., holding those involved with human rights violations accountable) and change. The nomination of a human rights-sanctioned individual (just-retired IGP Benazir Ahmed) to attend an international conference does not signal accountability or change.More broadly, let me emphasise, sanctions need not limit our relations or cooperation in other areas. The United States and Bangladesh have a broad relationship and deep cooperation in many areas, including trade, development, health, and security.DS: You have repeatedly spoken of fair and inclusive elections in Bangladesh as the Biden administration's key foreign policy focus is democracy and human rights.  Do you think that Bangladesh is going the right way ahead of the upcoming national elections in early 2024? Do you have any suggestions?PH: The United States believes the strength of a democracy rests in the ability of its people to make their voices heard. Our policy on the Bangladeshi elections -- or anywhere for that matter -- is that the people of the country should be able to choose their own government through free and fair elections, conducted in accordance with international standards. We do not support any political party.News reports of intimidation and political violence in Bangladesh are disturbing. Free and fair elections cannot take place in such an environment. We call on all parties to respect the rule of law and to refrain from violence, coercion, intimidation, or retribution. Moreover, for journalists to be able to cover the elections freely and fully, they must be protected from harassment and violence.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said she and her government want free and fair parliamentary elections. We welcome these words and look forward to understanding how the government will ensure free and fair processes. We support constructive actions Bangladesh can take, ahead of the polls, to carry out a credible process.DS: The US considers labour rights a very important issue.  Exactly, what are the labour issues that the US is concerned with, and where do you think reforms are needed?  What do you think is the overriding labour rights issue that Bangladesh needs to address?PH: Although Bangladesh has taken some initial steps to amend its labour laws, workers continue to be subjected to unfair labour practices, and they too often face retaliation when they complain or attempt to organise collectively for change.I note Bangladesh has adopted an occupation, health, and safety national plan and implemented remediation of some factories after the Rana Plaza tragedy. Yet, we continue to be concerned over workplace safety issues when we hear about deadly industrial incidents and workplace fires.Due to these labour rights issues, Bangladesh has been ineligible for the Generalised System of Preferences trade benefit. The lack of significant progress in this area prevents funding of development projects in Bangladesh by the US International Development Finance Corporation.The US and Bangladeshi governments meet several times a year to discuss the necessary changes to protect labour rights in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh government has indicated it is working to further amend its labour laws.  We are committed to supporting Bangladesh to improve its labour rights, including through targeted development assistance.DS: Bangladesh is paying a hefty price for the carbon pollution by global economic giants including the United States. Is there any prospect for US investment or cooperation in combating climate fallouts?PH: The United States applauds Bangladesh's leadership in addressing climate change and is a proud partner in addressing this problem.Earlier this year, the US embassy launched a $20 million project to protect critical forests and wetland areas in Bangladesh from degradation and help local communities develop long-term resilience to climate change. Our development programmes also strengthen resilience in communities most vulnerable to disasters or climate-related impacts -- including support for early warning systems and shelters to mitigate severe weather emergencies, as well as interventions like helping farmers adopt climate-smart agriculture techniques.DS: Stability in Asia has suddenly become a major concern as the Biden administration aggressively executes its new Indo-Pacific strategy. The common perception is that this geopolitical development has placed Bangladesh's traditional relationship with China under stress. Is a vibrant Sino-Bangla relationship an obstacle to a warm US-Bangladesh relationship?PH: The United States' vision for the Indo-Pacific is a free and open region comprised of nations that are independent, strong, prosperous, and secure. We also envision a region that is more resilient to global challenges like pandemics and climate change, and in which nations and peoples are more interconnected. This is a vision we share with many of our allies and partners, including Bangladesh.Let me be direct about the relationship between the United States and China by quoting President Biden at the UN General Assembly earlier this month. ""As we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader. We do not seek conflict. We do not seek a Cold War. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.""We know that many countries, including the United States, have vital economic and people-to-people ties with China that they want to preserve. Our engagement in the Indo-Pacific is not against any one country, nor is it designed to make anyone choose between countries. Instead, our engagement is about advancing a positive, shared vision for creating a region where all nations can thrive.",2022-10-03

Some 42,000 tickets had been issued for a stadium designed to hold 38,000 people, he said.The incident was a ""dark day for all involved"", said FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, which has asked Indonesian football authorities for a report on the incident.Its safety regulations say firearms or ""crowd control gas"" should not be used at matches.A tearful Arema FC president Gilang Widya Pramana apologised on Monday to the victims of the stampede and said he took full responsibility for the disaster.""Lives are more precious than soccer,"" he told a news conference.In an address on Sunday, Pope Francis said he had prayed for those who have lost their lives and for the injured from the disaster.Police and sport officials have been sent to Malang to investigate an incident that ranks among the world's deadliest stadium disasters.""All those responsible should be held accountable for this disaster, regardless of their status or position,"" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch said on Monday.",2022-10-03

In the US, the Consumer-Price Index rose 8.3 per cent in August from the same month a year ago.And exporters warned that the negative growth may continue for another one or two months because of the double-digit inflation in Europe and higher consumer prices in the US and the growing threat of the world falling into recession.Overall earnings in the July-September quarter were, however, up 13.38 per cent at $12.49 billion.Similarly, garment shipment rose 13.41 per cent to $10.27 billion during the three-month period. Of the amount, $5.64 billion came from the knitwear sector and $4.62 billion from the woven segment, up 9.40 per cent and 18.73 per cent respectively from the identical quarter a year earlier.The shipment of woven garment items has been displaying a strong rebound because of the improvement in the coronavirus pandemic situation as the people have returned to offices and are going out and attending social events.""We expect that the earnings from the garment sector will rebound strongly from December as international retailers and brands are confirming previously stalled orders,"" said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA).International retailers and brands have put on hold the orders because of the price escalation of the raw materials and higher inflation caused by higher prices of essentials and energy costs for the Russia-Ukraine war.""However, the situation is improving thanks to a fall in the prices of petroleum products and cotton in international markets,"" Hassan said.Cotton prices fell to 80 to 84 US cents per pound last week from $1-$1.05. This led retailers and brands to begin confirming the orders.

And we want accountability, who is to blame?"" said 25-year-old Andika, who declined to give his last name.""We want justice for our fallen supporters,"" he said.Outside the Kanjuruhan stadium on Sunday evening, people held a vigil beneath the roaring lion statue -- the club's symbol -- to honour the victims.But fresh graffiti daubed on the walls of the stadium revealed bubbling anger towards the authorities.""My siblings were killed.

/news/bangladesh/politics/news/bcl-run-the-whim-joy-lekhak-3133871,"BCL run at the whim of Joy, Lekhak","Bangladesh Chhatra League has been running its organisational activities in an ""undemocratic"" manner for the most part of the last four years, much to the dismay of its leaders and activists.Ever since they became the president and general secretary of the central committee in 2019, Al Nahean Khan Joy and Lekhak Bhattacharjee have been making organisational decisions at whim and in violation of the charter, insiders said. Aggrieved BCL leaders allege the democratic practices within the organisation have been pushed into the back seat as the top leaders are running the student body arbitrarily.The organisation was not run like this in its golden years leading up to the 1971 Liberation War.Joy and Lekhak did not respond to repeated calls and text messages for comments.As per the BCL charter, the incumbent central committee must make preparations for holding a council to elect the next president and general secretary before its two-year tenure ends. But the current committee made no such move in the last four years.The duo also failed to form committees in at least 67 out of the 116 district units within the stipulated one-year time. In some districts, councils are pending for over 10 years.Barishal district unit, for example, was formed in 2011 and its tenure expired a decade ago. The tenure of the Dhaka University unit, one of the most influential units of BCL, expired in 2019.The two also did not hold a single bi-monthly meeting of the central committee. As a result, the central BCL leaders could not discuss any political matters and express their opinions or dissatisfactions over organisational issues.""There are no democratic practices within the Chhatra League. The president and general secretary make decisions on all matters without seeking opinions of the executive council. Other leaders in the committee have no roles except for occupying the posts,"" Sohan Khan, a vice-president of central BCL, told The Daily Star.Enraged by the top leaders' activities, a faction of central BCL leaders went to Awami League President Sheikh Hasina's Dhanmondi office on September 10 to submit a written complaint against Joy and Lekhak on various issues, including violation of the charter.But the office secretary refused to accept it. They waited there for hours and left after a senior AL leader committed to sitting with them on the matter at a convenient time.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is organisational chief of BCL, picked Joy and Lekhak as acting president and acting general secretary on September 14, 2019. She made the decision after the president and general secretary of the previous committee -- Rezwanul Haque Chowdhury Shovon and Golam Rabbani -- lost their posts following allegations of bribery and other controversies.Four months later, Hasina made them full-fledged president and general secretary.Under the BCL charter, its president and general secretary are elected every two years through direct votes of the councillors coming from across the country.'VIOLATION IS THE NORM'According to the BCL constitution, the organisation must operate in the light of its charter.Section 13 (Kha) of the BCL constitution limits the tenure of the central executive committee to two years, meaning the present committee has expired two years ago.A fresh council must be held within two years for the election of the next committee. However, if required, the two-year tenure can be extended by up to three months upon approval from the central committee members.""But the existing committee did not hold a fresh council nor officially extend its tenure,"" said a BCL vice-president, wishing anonymity.Theoretically, the current BCL committee has no mandate to run the organisation.The BCL vice-president said the previous six committees also occupied the posts for about four years.The central committee is not supposed to have more than 301 members. But in reality it has 700 members.""During the month of mourning [August], more than 500 people were included in the central committee without any scrutiny,"" reads the complaint prepared for submission to Sheikh Hasina.Sources said Joy and Lekhak handpicked them and made them members of the organisation simply by sending them letters to this effect.BCL leaders said the duo announced 13 committees of different units which include district, upazila, and university committees from July 6 to July 31. But it was done without holding any councils, which is a violation of its charter.""Violating the constitution has become a norm for the top leadership. We are very frustrated to see that an organisation like Chhatra League is being run like this,"" said a central BCL leader.",2022-10-03

However, they suffered a similar fate to Thailand as the title holders couldn't stand against Pakistan in their second match.Chasing a humble total of 71 in 20 overs, Bismah Maroof's troop comfortably reached the target. The opening 49-run stand between wicketkeeper batter Muneeba Ali and Sidra Ameen set the sail towards victory. Followed by Muneeba's departure in the eighth over by Salma Khatun, skipper Bismah Maruf and Sidra comfortably reached the target winning the game by nine wickets with 46 balls left to play. Earlier, Pakistan won the toss and sent Bangladesh to bat first. Pakistan captain Bismah's plans hit the jackpot as their bowling attack were all over their counterparts and didn't let the champions grow any form of resistance. A couple of wickets each from Dina Baig and Nida Dar while Sadia Iqbal and Omaima Sohail's solitary wickets each only led Bangladesh to score 70 runs off eight wickets in 20 overs. Skipper Nigar Sultana Joty scored a slow 17 off 30 balls while veteran batter Salma Khatun remained unbeaten on 24.

/news/bangladesh/politics/news/al-bnp-overdrive-woo-allies-3133856,"AL, BNP in overdrive to woo allies","The ruling Awami League and its arch-rival the BNP are working to bring like-minded political parties into their fold ahead of the next parliamentary election.As part of the move, the AL is trying to expand its alliance by taking the pro-liberation political forces on board. It is also taking steps to strengthen the 14-party alliance, insiders said.The BNP, on the other hand, is focused on waging a simultaneous movement with all the opposition forces. It has begun talks with like-minded parties so they could join hands and realise the demand for a neutral polls-time administration, BNP leaders said.Before the 2008 election, the AL formed a 14-party alliance with pro-liberation and left-leaning parties. At the same time, it formed a greater alliance including the Jatiya Party and participated in the polls.After the 2018 election, the relations between the AL and its partners in the 14-party alliance deteriorated because of the smaller parties' lack of representation in the government. Some of the allies were also vocal against the government on different issues.The main opposition in parliament, the Jatiya Party, was an electoral partner of the AL in the elections held in 2008, 2014 and 2018.The relations between the AL and JP have lately been strained as the former believes JP Chairman GM Quader has reached an understanding with the BNP leaders about a simultaneous anti-government movement, sources said.Last month, Quader said his party did not belong to any alliance with the AL.The ruling party is now working on its relations with the member parties of the 14-party combine and has already sat with them several times.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also had a meeting on March 15 with the partners of its ""ideological alliance"". Like the previous two elections, the AL will contest the 2024 national election under the banner of the 14-party alliance. The polls are slated for early 2024.Amir Hossain Amu, coordinator and spokesperson of the alliance, told The Daily Star that the AL is planning to expand the combine with the pro-liberation forces.""Our door is open for any democratic and pro-liberation party. Now we are trying to strengthen our relations with the alliance partners. We will organise some joint programmes in the coming days,"" he said.AL praesidium member and Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque also told The Daily Star that the party is trying to brush up on its communications with the like-minded and pro-liberation parties.It also plans to step up its political activities keeping in mind the BNP's series of programmes, insiders said.The ruling party, however, does not want to come up with any counter programme as the party leaders believe such programmes would only invite confrontations.Currently, the ruling party is holding grassroots conferences, and  it believes these conferences and new leaderships will help it boost its political activities across the country.But the party will resist the opposition on the streets if the BNP does  excesses in the name of anti-government movement, said party leaders.Talking to this paper, Razzaque said, ""The Awami League is not an opposition party. We will not take to the streets with political programmes.""AL General Secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader on Saturday said the BNP would face stiff resistance if it tried to create chaos.Meanwhile, the BNP started the second round of talks with the alliance and like-minded political parties to wage a simultaneous movement against the government. It held a meeting with the Bangladesh Kalyan party yesterday and reached an agreement on launching a movement for a neutral election-time government.In the first round of talks, the BNP leaders sat with 23 political parties including the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Rob), Nagorik Oikya, Biplabi Workers Party, and Gonosamhati Andolon.After the talks, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told reporters that in the first round of talks, the parties agreed on waging simultaneous movements. And in the latest round, the parties are finalising the issues and the demands that will be highlighted in the movement.""The BNP has drafted a number of demands for the movement and we have  agreed on those points,"" Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, chairman of Bangladesh Kalyan Party, told The Daily Star.He added that the BNP leadership wanted the movement to be simultaneous, not under an alliance.Fakhrul said that in the second round of talks, the BNP leaders would meet all the political parties, except the AL.The BNP is looking for simultaneous movements while keeping its 20-party alliance and Jatiya Oikya Front inactive.Sources said the BNP adopted this strategy keeping in mind the local and international reservations about the Jamaat-e-Islami, a key component of the alliance.BNP sources said the party faced widespread criticisms at home and abroad for its links to Jamaat, which is condemned for assisting the Pakistan occupation forces during the 1971 Liberation War.There has been pressure from within the BNP to cut ties with the Jamaat. Besides, other political parties earlier showed reluctance to be in a coalition with the BNP because of its relations with the Jamaat.",2022-10-03

The ARCASIA consists of members from 22 Asian countries and is an extension of their institute's regional programmes and relations. They organise several architectural competitions and seminars, intending to unite architects in this region and provide them with a platform to maintain professional networks. It is a worldwide forum for ARCASIA member countries and architecture schools to display talent and ideas, to boost the quality of architectural education in Asia as a whole. It appreciates the idea of honouring thesis work from graduating students to create the ground for cross-border sharing of educational methods in the field of architecture.Students are encouraged to submit their final year thesis and the top three projects are forwarded to the Institute of Architects of Bangladesh (IAB). These are selected as the winners of the national round and are submitted to ARCASIA. Finally, three thesis projects are honoured with the Thesis of the Year (TOY) Award. ""Winning this prestigious award has been an amazing experience and nothing short of a dream come true. I enjoyed the ceremony and made friends with people from diverse cultural backgrounds,"" shared Taorem Sananu.Sananu, who hails from Homerzan Village in Moulvibazar, was the youngest member of team Bangladesh. She participated in the conference wearing the traditional clothes of the Manipuri community, thereby staying true to her roots.  Her thesis, entitled ""Blurring the Line"", focused on rejuvenating entrepreneurial potential to develop the socio-economic scenario of urban slums. This project was supervised by Dr Khandaker Shabbir Ahmed, Professor, and Md. Mizanur Rahman, Assistant Professor, of the Department of Architecture, BUET.The flexibility of slums combined with the static nature of urban structures tends to create a fine line that distinguishes the two areas. This conspicuous divide is just a reflection of the contrast between urban poor and city inhabitants, which is ultimately the result of more significant economic and social inequalities between these populations. The differences in economic level lead to a difference in social standing, which results in the tangible segregation of this demographic of people. Such economic, social, and physical barriers have hampered the expansion of the slums, leaving little room for socioeconomic progress and eventually forcing them to become a burden to the development of the city.Sananu's project addresses this problem by harnessing the spirit of slum entrepreneurs, from the Sattala slum. In her model, economic redevelopment is achieved by redistributing this existing market layout and integrating entrepreneur-friendly approaches within the existing scenario. She designed three types of modules, all at different thresholds, to blur all sorts of lines thereby, constructing an interdependent relationship between these two communities.Maisha Islam Monamee is a student of IBA, DU, and a freelance journalist who likes reading, scribbling, and blogging.

/business/economy/news/three-factors-holding-back-economy-3134446,Three factors holding back economy,"The interest rate cap on loans, the frequent changes to the exchange rate regime and a relaxed attitude to enforcing austerity measures are the major challenges facing Bangladesh in restoring stability in the economy. On several occasions in the last couple of months both the government and the Bangladesh Bank have claimed that the foreign exchange market will become stable within two to three months. But in reality, the situation is getting complicated with each passing day.The latest blow came last month when remittance and export receipts fell significantly whereas higher import bills, which have been at the heart of the pain facing the economy, have deepened the stress.The poor show of the three major indicators of the economy brought the foreign exchange reserves further down: It stood at $36.44 billion on September 28, down 6.7 per cent from August 31 and 21.25 per cent from a year ago.In order to curb inflation, which has been running high for several months for higher commodity prices and energy costs and US dollar shortages, the central bank asked banks to receive the full amount in advance from importers while opening letters of credit for consumer goods. But import payments have not declined as expected.The BB has also increased its key interest rate thrice since May, raising it to 5.75 per cent, in keeping with the stance the central banks around the world are following.The key interest rate, which is termed repurchase agreement (repo) in Bangladesh, determines the interest rate on both deposits and loans in the banking system. Banks also take short-term loans from the central bank quoting the rate.A higher repo rate is supposed to make funds costlier, which, in turn, will discourage borrowers from taking loans.The BB has maintained a 9 per cent interest rate cap since April 2020 at the instruction of the government, paving the way for the availability of cheaper funds for borrowers.Economists have been mostly unanimous in calling for the withdrawal of the ceiling in order to reduce the money supply since inflation has gone up and imports escalated. But the central bank has not paid heed to the suggestions. Subsequently, the country's private sector credit growth swelled to 14.07 per cent in August, reaching the touching distance of the BB's target of 14.10 per cent set for the whole fiscal year.Central banks usually raise the repo rate to reduce the money supply in order to contain inflation, but BB's repo rate hike is not working at all thanks to the interest rate cap.Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office, says that inflation could have been tackled had the BB withdrawn the interest rate cap.In July, inflation fell to 7.48 per cent from a nine-year high of 7.56 per cent in June. The government has not published the figure for August and September.A withdrawal of the interest rate cap can also help rein in import payments as it would discourage borrowers from importing more.But in reality, overall import payments swelled 26.5 per cent year-on-year to $20.69 billion in the first three months of the fiscal year.The central bank has seemed to be in a quagmire while setting the exchange rate of the taka against the dollar since volatility hit the foreign exchange market.The BB had followed a fixed exchange rate for a long time to ensure a stronger local currency, albeit artificially. But such a stance has come under pressure once reserves started depleting to keep the wheels of the economy moving.In June, the BB decided to move towards a floating exchange rate when remittances started to decline sharply. It later backpedalled when the taka lost its value sharply against the dollar.The US dollar traded at Tk 105.20 on October 2, up 23 per cent year-on-year.On September 12, banks were allowed to set the exchange rate under the guidance of the central bank.""The repeated changes to the exchange rate regime have adversely affected the remittance flow,"" Hussain said.Despite a surge in the outflow of migrant workers, remittances declined 11 per cent year-on-year to $1.54 billion in September, the lowest in seven months. Migrant workers sent home more than $2 billion each month between July and August.""There is no reason for the remittance to fall in September as a record 7.84 lakh migrant workers left the country for jobs abroad in the first eight months of this year,"" said Hussain.Experts blame the hundi, an illegal cross-boundary financial transaction system, for the falling remittance.Expatriate Bangladeshis used to get as high as Tk 115 for each dollar if they sent the money through the official channel. But as per a decision taken by banks last month, no lender now offers more than Tk 108 for a dollar from foreign exchange houses, which facilitate remittance transfers.""The central bank should follow a uniform exchange rate instead of multiple fixed exchange rates,"" said Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh.""If the fluctuation in the exchange rate regime persists, the remittance flow will continue facing difficulties.""In addition, exchange houses might not have remitted the money immediately so that the foreign exchange market faces further volatility and they can gain from the situation.He hopes remittance flow would accelerate within a few months if a proper policy action is taken.""Law enforcement agencies should take strict actions against the people involved in hundi,"" said Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue. Although the government earlier took various initiatives to implement austerity measures, no significant progress to this end is visible.The country has been enforcing power outage since July to save diesel amid its spike in price globally, in a bid to cut consumption and save US dollars. It has also stopped importing liquefied natural gas, sending the supply of natural gas low amid inadequate domestic generation.  But since factories are facing more than 10 hours of load-shedding nowadays, many manufacturers have turned to diesel owing to a lower pressure of gas and power supply, said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, on Sunday. As a result, the consumption of diesel has increased, he said.Zahid Hussain urged the government to stop the implementation of development projects funded by the domestic resources.This is because a large amount of US dollars is required to implement such projects and it is mobilised from the local source. Although the government had earlier taken a decision not to implement such projects, adequate action is not visible.""Austerity measures are also important for the private sector,"" said Mansur.",2022-10-04

/daily-star-books/news/fanfiction-and-the-art-retelling-stories-3134831,Fanfiction and the art of retelling stories,"The term 'fanfiction', self-explanatory enough, describes amateur fiction pieces written by a fan, based on popular literary works. Its writers are devoted members of their respective fandoms—be it books, television shows, a film franchise, or a video game; these fans spend considerable amounts of time revisiting the universes of their favourite characters. So much so, that continuing the narrative to their own liking becomes the next logical step. Despite the great effort that often goes into these works, writers do not really emphasise on putting it through a publication process; they are mainly published on online platforms like Wattpad, and shared via their personal social media accounts—should they choose to circulate it. In commercially published works, there is always a name, a face and biography attached to the book; book-signings and interviews take place where the readers can glimpse at the person behind the work.Fanfiction writers, in contrast, mostly write their content incognito: their profiles are devoid of their photos and their real names hidden behind aliases. So the questions remain: Why do they take such great efforts to create new, additional plot-points and storylines of content that have already been sufficiently discussed and explored by the original creators themselves? Why not develop their own new story/universe? Why put in so many hours into writing about someone else's work? To appreciate the 'fanfic' writer, one must understand how a fan's mind works. Fans are not just passive consumers. They do not finish reading a book or watching a show and move on with their lives. Instead we spend hours reimagining scenes, wondering about other possibilities and contemplating pivotal moments from within the fictional world that we have grown to love. And sometimes, in our obsessive devotion, we let our minds run wild, and this is why we create fan-clubs, the existence of which often prompts activities such as cosplaying and multi-day fan conventions and expositions. And when our imaginations continue to overflow with possibilities and our minds keep churning out newer ideas about the source material, the only way forward is to write it all down. I believe fanfiction is written for a number of reasons. Some fans want to explore other possibilities by expanding on certain ideas from the source material that they most cherish. Others seek to answer questions that were left unexplored, and many others seek to change elements in the story to result in an ending to their satisfaction. Some ambitious fans want to explore the possibilities of combining two or more franchises to form crossovers. Personally, my mind has often wondered what would have happened if Nina Zenik and Matthias Helvar from Six of Crows escaped to Novyi Zem instead of coming back to Ketterdam, or how the story of Lord of the Rings would have progressed if Boromir managed to snatch the ring from Frodo. These are questions that can only be answered by fanfiction writers. No matter how many reasons there are for writing fanfiction, they all intimately coalesce into a simple fact: fanfiction is written and read because it allows fans to spend a little extra time with the characters they have grown to adore. What fan would not want to prolong their time within a story surrounded by the fictional characters, whose joys and struggles have moved them, characters that they have rooted for and characters that they have lost? Despite this kind of sincere devotion, many critics dismiss fanfiction writers as being too lazy or lacking in active imagination, stemming from the concern that the content is based on borrowed characters and plots (even though all fanfiction comes with a disclaimer that gives all content ownership to the original creators). Simply explained, fanfiction is just a devoted fan's mind asking, ""What if?"" The genre means that the author or the creator of the fictional work has touched the hearts of their fans, it means that they have given their fans hope and vision, causing positive ripples in their lives. Fanfiction is the greatest love letter a work of art can receive from a fan.Sameirah Nasrin Ahsan is a mechanical engineer in Dhaka. She aspires to be an author someday.

/news/world/news/why-svante-paabo-won-2022-nobel-prize-medicine-3134761,Why Svante Paabo won 2022 Nobel Prize in medicine?,"Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for discoveries that underpin our understanding of how modern day people evolved from extinct ancestors at the dawn of human history.Paabo's work demonstrated practical implications during the COVID-19 pandemic when he found that people infected with the virus who carry a gene variant inherited from Neanderthals are more at risk of severe illness than whose who do not.Paabo, director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, won the prize for ""discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution,"" the Award committee said.""The thing that's amazing to me is that you now have some ability to go back in time and actually follow genetic history and genetic changes over time,"" Paabo told a news conference at the Max Planck Institute. ""It's a possibility to begin to actually look on evolution in real time, if you like.""Paabo, 67, said he thought the call from Sweden was a prank or something to do with his summer house there.""So I was just gulping down the last cup of tea to go and pick up my daughter at her nanny where she has had an overnight stay,"" Paabo said in a recording posted on the Nobel website.""And then I got this call from Sweden and I of course thought it had something to do with our little summer house ... I thought the lawn mower had broken down or something.""Asked if he thought he would get the award, he said: ""No, I have received a couple of prizes before but I somehow did not think that this really would qualify for a Nobel Prize.""Paabo, son of a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, has been credited with transforming the study of human origins after developing ways to allow for the examination of DNA sequences from archaeological and paleontological remains.Not only did he help uncover the existence of a previously unknown human species called the Denisovans, from a 40,000-year-old fragment of a finger bone discovered in Siberia, his crowning achievement is considered to be the methods developed to allow for the sequencing of an entire Neanderthal genome.'GENETIC DIFFERENCES'This research, which showed that certain genes of Neanderthal origin are preserved in the genomes of people today, was once considered impossible, given that Neanderthal DNA on bones has shrivelled up over thousands of years into short fragments that have to be assembled like a gigantic puzzle, and are also heavily contaminated with microbial DNA.""This ancient flow of genes to present-day humans has physiological relevance today, for example affecting how our immune system reacts to infections,"" the Nobel Committee said.The prize, among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is awarded by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden's Karolinska Institute and is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($900,357).It is the first of this year's batch of prizes.Born in Stockholm, Paabo studied medicine and biochemistry at Uppsala University before creating a scientific discipline called ""paleogenomics"", which helped show genetic differences that distinguish living humans from extinct hominins.""His discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human,"" the Committee said.The COVID-19 pandemic has placed medical research centre stage, with many expecting that the development of the vaccines that have allowed the world to regain some sense of normality may eventually be rewarded.Still, it typically takes many years for any given research to be honoured, with the committees charged with picking the winners looking to determine its full value with some certainty amongst what is always a packed field of contenders.PANDEMICWhen asked why the prize did not go to advances in combating COVID, Thomas Perlmann, secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, said the committee would only talk about prize winners, not those who had not won, or had not yet won.However, Paabo's ancient forensics work did offer insight on why some people are at higher risk of severe COVID.In 2020, a report from Paabo and colleagues found that a gene variant inherited by modern humans from Neanderthals when they interbred some 60,000 years ago made those that carry the variant more likely to require artificial ventilation if infected by the COVID-causing virus.""We can make an average gauge of the number of the extra deaths we have had in the pandemic due to the contribution from the Neanderthals. It is quite substantial, it's more than one million extra individuals who have died due to this Neanderthal variant that they carry,"" Paabo said in 2022 lecture.Paabo's most cited paper in the Web of Science was published in 1989, with 4,077 citations, said David Pendlebury, from UK-based scientific data analytics provider Clarivate.""Only some 2,000 papers out of 55 million published since 1970 have been cited this many times,"" he said.""It is, however, not an award for a discovery relevant to clinical medicine, which many anticipated this year after a Nobel Prize focusing on physiology last year.""Past winners in the field include a string of famous researchers, notably Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin, and Robert Koch, who won already in 1905 for his investigations of tuberculosis.",2022-10-04

But in recent months, the organisation has failed to meet its planned output increases, missing in August by 3.6 million bpd.""Whilst OPEC+ might announce a large cut (in excess of 1 million bpd), in reality, the cut could be much smaller.

But investors have lost their appetite for riskier debt such as leveraged loans, spooked by rapid interest rate hikes around the world, fears of recession and market volatility driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.While Musk will provide much of $44 billion by selling down his stake in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and by leaning on equity financing from large investors, major banks have committed to provide $12.5 billion.They include Morgan Stanley , Bank of America Corp and Barclays Plc (BARC.L).Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA), Mizuho Financial Group Inc (8411.T) and Societe Generale SA are also part of the syndicate.Noting other recent high-profile losses for banks in leveraged financing, more than 10 bankers and industry analysts told Reuters the outlook was poor for the banks trying to sell the debt.The Twitter debt package is comprised of $6.5 billion in leveraged loans, $3 billion in secured bonds, and another $3 billion in unsecured bonds.""From the banks' perspective, this is less than ideal,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. ""The banks have their backs to the wall - they have no choice but to finance the deal.""Leveraged financing sources have also previously told Reuters that potential losses for Wall Street banks involved in the Twitter debt in such a market could run to hundreds of millions of dollars.Societe Generale did not respond to a request for comment while the other banks declined to comment. Twitter also declined to comment. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Just last week, a group of lenders had to cancel efforts to sell $3.9 billion of debt that financed Apollo Global Management Inc's (APO.N) deal to buy telecom and broadband assets from Lumen Technologies Inc .That came on the heels of a group of banks having to take a $700 million loss on the sale of about $4.55 billion in debt backing the leveraged buyout of business software company Citrix Systems Inc.""The banks are on the hook for Twitter — they took a big loss on the Citrix deal a few weeks ago and they're facing an even bigger headache with this deal,"" said Chris Pultz, portfolio manager for merger arbitrage at Kellner Capital.Banks have been forced to pull back from leveraged financing in the wake of Citrix and other deals weighing on their balance sheet and that is unlikely to change anytime soon.The second quarter also saw U.S. banks start to take a hit on their leveraged loans' exposure as the outlook for dealmaking turned sour.

Another 50,000 are working as freelancers, according to an estimate by industry people.The growing demand for digital designs for e-commerce, catalogues, brochures, magazines, printings, newspapers, signboards, and business cards has created plenty of opportunities for local freelancers and firms.""Worldwide, the e-commerce boom has played a significant role in raising orders for graphic design and image processing,"" said Nazim Farhan Choudhury, chief executive officer of GraphicPeople.India, the Philippines and Vietnam have long been among the major markets for outsourcing for global clients, but Bangladesh has also become a favourite destination owing to lower prices and the ability to deliver large-scale work India, the Philippines and Vietnam have long been among the major markets for outsourcing for global clients, but Bangladesh has also become a favourite destination owing to lower prices and the ability to deliver large-scale work Located in Dhaka, GraphicPeople is an offshore studio providing digital print and production support services to advertising agencies and brands, and counts Dell and Microsoft among its customers. It employs about 250 people.With e-commerce and digital business thriving, the need for pictures and video has gone up. Large studios are flourishing in the global market.The segment even has the potential to diversify the export basket as basic skills are needed to get jobs in graphic design and image processing, said industry people.""What we are doing now is that we are providing backend editing and corrections. But we can be as large as the garment industry,"" Choudhury said.He said the garment sector, which accounts for about 85 per cent of Bangladesh's over $52 billion export earnings in the last fiscal year, has done a remarkable job. But, average salaries and export earnings per worker in the graphic designing and image editing segment are much higher than that of the apparel industry.""The value-edition is about 20 per cent in the garment sector whereas it is close to 100 per cent in the graphic designing and image editing segment.""The outsourcing of graphic designing and image editing is part of the business process outsourcing sector and the broader IT-enabled services industry.Bangladesh earned less than $500 million from the exports of IT-enabled services in the last fiscal year, data from the Export Promotion Bureau showed.However, the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS), the national trade body for software and IT-enabled services, put the figure at $1.3 billion since a significant portion of the overseas income is either brought into the country through unofficial channels or is not fetched at all.The global business process outsourcing market size was valued at $251 billion in 2021 and expected to reach $492 billion by 2028, said California-based newswire distribution network GlobeNewswire, citing data from SkyQuest Technology Consulting Pvt Ltd, an Indian firm.Skill-based training with an emphasis on student loans and certification, recognising companies with more than 500 employees as economic zones, and treating IT-enabled services as emergency services could propel the industry to a higher level and consistently support clients, said Choudhury.Mainly two groups of people work in the segment: individual freelancers working with marketplaces such as Upwork and Fiverr, and the other group that is employed by small and medium-sized firms.Kamruzzaman Sishir, a top-rated character illustrator at Fiverr, a global online marketplace for freelance services, said: ""It's a market with a huge potential.""But earnings depend on skills and there is stiff competition for the designing tasks that need basic skills.""Creativity matters. Some people with a six-month training might not land a job in designing whereas someone can win many orders with the same amount of training thanks to creativity,"" Sishir added.A skilled graphic designer and image editor can command six-figure salaries easily whereas someone with a lower level of skills struggles to earn Tk 15,000, according to the freelancer.The KOW Company, a content post-production management company with a focus on image and image editing, began its journey in 2014 with a three-member team and a one-room office in Dhaka's Bangla Motor. Today, it has grown into a family of more than 500 individuals working with 25 studios globally and processing around 25,000 photos every day.Kowser Ahmed Nirob, CEO and founder of The KOW Company, thinks image editing, computer-generated imagery, 3D, and content post-production segments have a big potential to fetch foreign currencies.From Bangladesh, many people go to the Middle East spending Tk 5 lakh to Tk 6 lakh. Many of them have to sell land to manage the fund. But the return is very low.""If they get proper training, they can earn foreign currencies sitting at home within a few months. Besides, graphic design and related verticals require basic skills to land jobs,"" said Nirob.According to the entrepreneur, it takes more than two years to become a skilled software developer.""But for image processing, if you train someone for six months, you will get a skilled worker to get your job done.""Wahid Sharif, president of the Bangladesh Association of Contact Center and Outsourcing, said as e-commerce and digital needs are thriving globally, the demand for image processing and related segments is growing fast.""It is one of the most promising areas in the business process outsourcing.""Russell T Ahmed, president of the BASIS, said creativity and basic skills are needed to flourish in the world of graphic designing and image editing.""For a graphic design or image editing job, you don't need a graduate in computer science and engineering. A graduate in the humanities and other areas can do it with training,"" he said.Ahmed underscores branding for the industry as well.""We are lagging when it comes to branding.

/opinion/views/news/exploiting-newtons-law-gravity-store-green-energy-3134951,Exploiting Newton’s law of gravity to store green energy,"Many power plants these days harness energies from solar radiation, wind, ocean waves, and other green sources. However, like many other innovations, these sources have downsides. We can generate abundant green power only when the sun shines or the wind blows or the waves roll.What do we do when the skies become dark and winds and oceans are calm? How do we satisfy the requirements of our energy-ravenous society?The solution to this predicament is based on the immutable Newtonian logic: ""What goes up, must come down."" It is the gravity battery that replicates the fabled story of Isaac Newton's falling apple, but reconfigured on a much larger scale – with a little twist.When a colossal mass, such as a concrete block, is lifted to a greater height using surplus green energy, it is stored in the block as gravitational energy. Also known as potential energy, it is the energy stored in an object because of its elevated position relative to the ground. The greater the height is, the greater potential energy is. When the block is lowered, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which sets the turbine of a generator into motion, producing electricity.Energy generated from gravity batteries is sustainable. Furthermore, they will store green energy when there is too much and release it into the grid when there is too little. Besides, the tremendous weight of the block coupled with its slow descent will create a huge amount of rotational force – or torque – in the generator, allowing it to deliver maximum power almost instantaneously.Gravity batteries have some distinct advantages over other batteries, such as lithium-ion or nickel-cadmium batteries that lose their capacity to store energy in a few years. Consequently, they have a short lifetime, and recycling these batteries is difficult. Moreover, whereas mining the minerals – cobalt, lithium, manganese, nickel, cadmium and other rare earth elements – required for these batteries poses environmental problems and health-related risks for the miners, a block of iron needed for a gravity battery has a much lighter environmental footprint.Because gravity batteries are mechanical devices, they can break. For example, a cable can snap, or a winch can jam, or a patch of rust can appear in a metallic part. Though problematic, these issues are not beyond repair, because individual components can be fixed or replaced with relative ease instead of replacing the entire system. So there is real scope for a gravity battery to have an operational life spanning a few decades.Gravitricity Ltd, a UK-based green engineering company founded in 2011, is working to make gravity batteries a reality. The company successfully tested its first prototype: an iron block weighing 50 tonnes, hoisted 15 metres up before gradually releasing it back, powering a series of electric generators with the downward gravitational force.When fully operational, Gravitricity expects each battery to release between one megawatt (MW) and 20MW at peak power for up to eight hours. According to their website, a 20MW power system ""could power 63,000 homes for every hour that it discharges.""Gravity batteries can also be deployed underground, leaving a significantly smaller surface footprint. They can be installed in abandoned mine shafts deep enough to house a full-sized battery. Electricity can be generated by raising the weights in the shaft, and then lowering them to activate a generator. Some researchers even came up with an unconventional yet ingenious idea of turning skyscrapers essentially into huge gravity batteries.Gravitricity is exploring the possibility of having a battery consisting of 24 weights, each weighing 500 tonnes, for a total of 12,000 tonnes located down a shaft at a depth of at least 300 metres. Once operational, the battery with a 50-year design life is anticipated to generate 20MW of power with a maximum efficiency of 80 percent.The idea of restoring abandoned sites of fossil fuel as repositories for green energy is not only eminently practical, it also embodies the values of ""just transition,"" which preaches principles and practices for transforming extractive economy into a regenerative one.Established in 2017 in southern Switzerland, Energy Vault is another leader in developing gravity batteries. When green power supply exceeds demand, the excess energy is used to lift a pair of 30-tonne blocks upwards to the top of a steel and concrete structure standing more than 20-storeys tall. When demand exceeds supply, they are dropped down, generating enough electricity for thousands of homes.Gravity batteries can also work on a small scale for use in places such as a remote village or a shed. It works on a simple principle. Attach to the light bulb hanging from a wall or ceiling a bag filled with rocks, sand, or any heavy object, and then winch it up to the top. As the bag gradually drops to the ground, it will drive a generator through a gearbox converting the motion to electricity that will light up the bulb for about 20 minutes, without using any fossil fuel.Another gravity-based energy storage technique is called Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH). It uses the force of gravity to produce electricity by funnelling water uphill using surplus solar, wind or other green power, and then, when needed, forces it down to drive the electricity-generating turbine in a power station. Unlike conventional hydropower plants, PSH recycles the water. First used in the US in 1930, PSHs have a long life with minimal maintenance requirement and little ecological repercussions. PSH facilities can be found in many countries now.The world needs bold and innovative climate solutions right now, particularly for storing green energy for later use. On this front, there may not be any silver bullets. But gravity batteries – with their harnessing of a truly infinite, omnipresent gravitational force – certainly have a role to play. The big question is: how soon will gravity batteries come to fruition? Dr Quamrul Haider is a professor of physics at Fordham University in New York, US.

A group of Dhaka University students of theater and performance studies department started research at Pabna Mental Hospital -- on how patients suffering from mental illness can be treated using ""cultural therapy"".In the past two days, a group of five departmental students -- Fazle Navid Onon, Tanvir Newaz Tirtho, Jannatul Mawa Nibir, Farzana Afrin Meem, and Shithi Ishra Risil -- conducted field research among patients and medical staff of the hospital, reports our Pabna correspondent.""Many of the mentally ill people we spoke with have an extraordinary ability to expose themselves. In addition to traditional medicine, they also need cultural therapy to help them enjoy life. Cultural therapy can help a mental patient in this way,"" said Fazle Navid Onon, a member of the research team.He explained that theoretically, cultural therapy is divided into three categories: ""art therapy,"" ""drama therapy,"" and ""music therapy.""""Different patients have various preferences. Some patients enjoy drama and painting, while others enjoy music. Before working with a patient, we must first determine what is appropriate for that patient,"" said another team member Jannatul Mawa.""The majority of the patients we spoke with and tried to implement these three methods with during our visit to the mental hospitals in Pabna had positive responses, so we are optimistic that the cultural therapy will be successful for mental patients,"" she added.""We have already gathered patient histories and followed their medical care before deciding to start therapy,"" said Tanvir Newaz, adding that the initiative will be more successful if it takes on an organisational structure.Students launched the research work under the supervision of departmental teacher Professor Dr Ishrafil Shahin to implement ""cultural therapy"" for giving treatment among the mental patients.However, Dr Safkat Wahid, director of Pabna Mental Hospital, told The Daily Star that if ""cultural therapy"" can be properly implemented, it will be a key development in the treatment of mental patients, but it should be implemented at the domestic level.",2022-10-05

/business/economy/opinion/news/creating-virtuous-circles-between-urban-planning-and-urban-transit-3135616,Creating virtuous circles between urban planning and urban transit,"Cities are not just places where people live. They are massive labour markets and engines of economic growth, facilitating structural transformation of economies towards manufacturing and service activities. New urban transport infrastructure changes how people access jobs and matches employees to firms.The relationship between urban development and transport systems is both critical and complex. Without effective urban transit, commuting becomes too costly, and cities cannot deliver on their full economic potential.Many cities in developed countries have a high enough density of demand to support urban transit infrastructure. This is not always the case in developing countries, especially in Africa, where urban structure is fragmented, and firms and households are dispersed. Fragmented urban development disconnects workers from jobs preventing the emergence of sustainable mobility options.In Nairobi, Kenya, 42 per cent of the population walk to work. They can only access 11 per cent of jobs and even the further 28 per cent who take minibuses are only able to access 20 per cent of jobs.  As a result of this fragmented urban form, Nairobi does not have an integrated labour market. Instead, it functions like a city with multiple small villages.The fragmented urban form and the preponderance of informal sector jobs in Cape Town, South Africa have made mass transit ineffective when it comes to connecting to labour markets. The Central Business District has become the transfer point for peripheral dwellers to connect to job opportunities on another spoke in the public transport network. The hub-and-spoke public transport network provides inconvenient connections, especially to the poor workers commuting from the periphery.As such, an increasing number of poor people in South Africa are opting out of the public transport system as they decide to take up jobs closer to their homes. Ironically, government funding flows primarily to large scale transport options, such as railways that carry only 16 per cent of passengers, even as two thirds of commuting trips are made on unregulated minibuses.Where urban density is higher, scale dependent transport solutions, such as the Bus Rapid Transit, (BRT) can emerge. There are now more than 180 of such systems operating globally, yet little is known about their economic impacts in emerging cities.Lagos, Nigeria is among the few urban areas in Africa with high density of demand, and one of the first cities in the region to invest in modern mass transit infrastructure.Lagos has a population of twenty-four million people and an additional one million people are reported to move to the city in search of jobs annually. In an effort to decongest the city and increase productivity, the government has developed an integrated multi-model transport plan that calls for the construction of six railway lines, 14 BRT systems, along with a comprehensive reform of bus and water transport systems.Currently, people spend four hours in congestion daily, on average, which is detrimental to productivity.To increase connectivity of isolated communities to the main transport interchange locations, last mile buses have been introduced to connect people to the BRT system. In other areas, non-motorised transport systems, such as bicycle racks where people can rent bicycles to assist with mobility, have been introduced.However, there has been no research conducted to quantify the benefits arising from transit investment in Lagos. This makes it difficult to know what complementary investments and policies need to be introduced to unlock the full economic potential of the city.BRT'S EFFECT ON COMMUTER CHOICES AND JOB ACCESSIBILITYRecent research on Bogota, Colombia's BRT system reveals the immediate effect on commuter choices and job accessibility, as well as the equilibrium effects on wages and house prices.Thanks to shorter commuting times, BRT systems can significantly increase the number of jobs accessible to residents. This is especially true for the urban poor, who are 25 per cent more likely to commute to work by bus. In addition, the development of new BRT systems increases residential floorspace prices and residential population and yields overall economic welfare gains of one to two percent.WOMEN AND URBAN TRANSITPublic transport invigorates local labour market, and their design affects the participation of disadvantaged groups. In particular, poor transit systems have been identified as a major factor in job location choices of women.Countries like India, Brazil and Mexico have introduced a variety of measures to improve women's safety on mass transit. Several studies show that women are willing to pay more for transport services that offer a sense of increased safety and greater social acceptability:A study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, finds that a fifth of women riders are willing to pay 20 per cent more of the fare to ride in the ""safe space"" of women-only subway cars, where the risk of physical harassment is reported to be 50 per cent lower.In Cairo, Egypt, research shows that women are more willing to pay for ride-hailing and ride-sharing due to improved safety relative to other options. Lowering the price of these services further increases female mobility.In Lahore, Pakistan, a study reveals that offering women-only transport services reduced physical mobility constraints and resulted in increased job searches for women. Those who received a 50 per cent transport subsidy were four times more likely to apply for jobs than those that did not.SUPPORTING URBAN TRANSPORT PLANNERS WITH NEW QUANTITATIVE ECONOMIC MODELSQuantifying transit and land use policies is important for helping policy-makers understand what complementary policies should be developed to maximise the return on infrastructure investments.New Urban Models, such as those developed by Gabriel M Ahfeldt, a professor of urban economics and land development at the London School of Economics, can help city leaders visualise how economic productivity and urban form mutually interact as they provide a better description of the city and give a much richer set of responses to infrastructure investment and policy changes.For instance, a tradable and dense city may have different options from a crowded and fragmented city. The model developed by Ahfedt of an internal city structure features agglomeration and dispersion forces, and an arbitrary number of heterogeneous city blocks, which makes it tractable and amenable to empirical analysis.Research on transit infrastructure has mainly been conducted in wealthy economies. There is limited evidence in developing countries, which are vastly different.For instance, there might be low population density and fragmented distribution, high levels of congestion, and a different set of modal choices, given that a sizable-large informal sector provides the vast majority of commuting trips for many.There is a need to develop innovative transport solutions that can be efficient and cost-effective in the low-density cities of developing economies. Economic models can play an essential role in informing this process. Nick Tsivanides is an assistant professor of the Department of Economics at the University of California at Berkeley; Somik Lall is a lead economist of the World Bank; and Mumba Ngulube is the infrastructure economist at the World Bank.",2022-10-05

Whether you want to go for a single day tour or take your time to visit the beautiful places spread around the district, we recommend these 6 places to be part of your next travel itinerary.  The place that is in everyone's travelling wish list, Tanguar Haor is a unique wetland ecosystem located in the Dharmapash and Tahirpur upazilas. Witness the haor turn into a large waterbody with strong waves in monsoon or greet over 200 kinds of migratory birds in winter; the wetland is a soothing sight for the tired urban eyes. To fully experience the magic of haors, reserve a boat and just roam around on the waters, see fishermen catch over 140 species of fresh water fishes and witness the diverse natural and aquatic elements.Also known as The Keane Bridge, built in 1936, Surma Bridge is one of the most iconic steel and iron architectures of Bangladesh. Standing on the Surma River, this bridge is 18 feet wide and 1150 feet long. Roaming around the bridge as the day ends, while the river under is glowing in the moonlight is a visual treat for all travellers. Even with new bridges around, the Surma Bridge still gives a nostalgic feeling of the bygone era.Originating in Meghalaya and flowing into Sunamganj, this river is close to Tanguar haor. If you want to see really blue waters where even the river bed can be seen in shallow areas, then this is the river for you. In monsoon this river gets wider while in winter the white sandy banks give it a wonderful picturesque scenic element.On the bank of Jadukata River, a small hillock of about 150 feet high is located named Barik Tila. The dividing point of the Bangladesh border with India, one needs to go to the hillock to get a wider and clearer view of both sides. From this side of the border, stunning panoramic views of mountains and forests of Meghalaya can be seen, giving this hillock a unique edge.   Hason Raja, a Bangladeshi mystic poet and songwriter, whose old house situated at the bank of Surma River in the Tegharia area, has been converted into a museum.

In a number of ways, I am no one special. I have not done much that is worthy of note, and have not won any awards you might know of. But I did grow up here and I know how the rain feels. I know the air and I know the dog that sits in the corner of my street. And so, perhaps foolishly, I feel like I can write to you. But I do have an ulterior motive, like all who write must.For the past 18 months, I have worked for an international agency engaged in the Rohingya refugee response. I have been fortunate enough to learn from a community forced out of their homes, and in their plight, I have seen time and time again the urgency of fighting for our collective future. My note to you is a request to think of those deprived of what you and I can take for granted.Right now, 4,000 Rohingyas are stuck in the ""no man's land"" between Bangladesh and Myanmar. While a small percentage compared to the one million who have found safety in Cox's Bazar, these 4,000 humans are victims of the same armed aggression, state brutality and global inaction that has defined generations of the Rohingya experience. Across an increasingly fractured world, conflict remains the primary driver of human displacement, and a reminder that things can break apart anytime, anywhere.To make matters worse, when humans are forced to flee, they are met with barbed wires and the blunt ends of rifles. The richest states are the worst offenders, with pushbacks and incarceration common across Europe and North America. Those who are lucky to find safety still face an uncertain future. Services, resources and compassion available to refugees vary greatly and, despite grand claims of equality, can often be traced over the colour of one's skin.Climate change is causing this already flawed system to short-circuit. In northern Bangladesh, the floodwaters showed no signs of receding for a month; in southern Iraq, rivers as old as civilisation itself are drying up. This change, this radical shift, acts as both cause and correlation, precipitating and amplifying the need for people to move. We cannot stop this; we can only prepare for it.What does this mean for Bangladesh, where one out of every seven people is projected to be displaced over the next few decades? One out of seven people can be someone we know, someone we love, someone we are willing to take on the world for.I am plagued by a question that has no easy answer: as the waters rise, as cities become richer and towns become poorer, how do we ensure that humans are able to move to provide for themselves and their families? How do we do so sustainably, yet humanely, in a crowded and under-resourced country? How do we urge the privileged to share responsibility for the forgotten?We are nowhere near where we need to be. Everything that will decide the future is up in the air: in Geneva, they are debating whether climate migrants are refugees; in Sylhet, they already are. These definitions matter because they are tied to responsibility and resources. Equally importantly, it matters who is part of these discussions – where they come from and what languages they speak.Everyone agrees that responsibilities need to be shared, but no one agrees on how. Those who start wars, and those who contribute disproportionately to climate change, should theoretically shoulder more, but that is often not the case. We are trying to hold these feet to the fire, but to paraphrase a colleague, we need more hands.Bangladesh, despite the great inequality that plagues it, is aware of the existential threat that faces everything we hold dear. But Bangladesh – and dare I say the world – needs you. You hold, in your anger and your compassion, the ability to bend the arc of our future towards justice. Your voices, in their unfiltered clarity and unbridled possibility, can inform and influence those with power over lives. Regardless of what others may tell you, you are in a position to inform. Everyone can read theory – only a few live it.And so, when you think your words are not strong enough, make them stronger. When your critique doesn't raise enough brows, be more critical. Tell us, no holds barred, about everything we are doing wrong – about systemic change, about local leadership, about innovation and opportunity.You don't have to be a humanitarian to do this work. On the contrary, those who do this for a living need reminders from those who want to live. Movements live and die with those who support them with their time and energy, with their rage and joy, with their art, their words, their stories about what is at stake: the rain, the air, the dog in the corner of the street we grew up in.Imrul Islam is the outgoing advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Bangladesh.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/unseen-pressure-beauty-circus-mahmud-didar-3135731,An unseen pressure is on ‘Beauty Circus’: Mahmud Didar,"When ""Beauty Circus"" first emerged with its teaser/trailer, it is safe to say that many received the wrong idea about the film. In reality, it is a wonderful amalgamation of the lost art of circus, and the times of our Liberation War.Mahmud Didar's debut directorial film was released in September 23, in 19 halls across the country. It features Jaya Ahsan, Ferdous, ABM Sumon, Gazi Rakayet and the late Humayun Sadhu, among others.The film went head-to-head with Dipankar Dipon's ""Operation Sundarban"", another heavyweight production by the RAB Welfare and Cooperative Society Limited. The latter, however, was released on the same day in 35 halls across the country. On the second week, halls for ""Operation Sundarban"" increased to 45, while halls for ""Beauty Circus"" was reduced to a measly 11 halls.The director of ""Beauty Circus"", Mahmud Didar, has been vocal about the fact that some 'unknown forces' have been tampering with the film's 'true' success. According to Didar, this is the reason why it did not get the number of halls, that the production crew had been hoping for. For this film Didar had received a government grant in the 2014-15 fiscal year. It has been co-produced by Channel i.""Our film so far has received a positive response, despite not being able to market properly before release,"" says Didar.On the first week of release, Jaya Ahsan expressed her disappointment with Star Cineplex authorities, for not giving them slots for evening show. Initially, Cineplex ran two shows of ""Beauty Circus"", at 11 am, and 4:50 pm. The actress expressed concerns that the audience prefers evening shows, in comparison. On its second week, ""Beauty Circus"" did finally get evening shows.The distribution of ""Beauty Circus"" had been sold to director Anonno Mamun. ""He was given the responsibility of managing the number of halls. However, after a few days of the film's release, he went to Kolkata and we couldn't reach him,"" shares the director. ""I won't directly blame anyone, but there has been an unseen pressure on every one, but from our end we did not put enough effort as well.""The director shares that after the announcement of its release date, they had been wanting postpone the date. Eventually, that did not happen, since the production house informed Didar that there is no empty slot in the coming months.""Our posters were not visible in the halls, I feel like we have been neglected,"" shares the dejected director. ""Honestly, even the halls that we showcased the film in, outside of Dhaka – most of them were not up to the mark.""""I am doing everything that is possible,"" says Didar. ""In a huge premise like Jamuna Blockbuster Cinemas, we had only one poster! Despite that, my audience is my strength, which is why we got houseful shows there.""""Due to a huge communication gap between the artistes and the producers, the entire production was hampered"", says the director.On the third week of its release, ""Beauty Circus"" is making its way to international waters. It will be released in Australia,on October 9, across a few theatres in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, and Canberra. ""It is definitely a great news for all of us, and I am hopeful that the international audience will receive the film well.""According to Didar, circus is an extinct culture in our country, it has been evicted by a group of fundamentalists. His film not only tells the tale of an indomitable woman and her struggle, but it also showcases the strength she has to fight against evil. ""Punching upwards is a theme that I explore, through the narrative of Beauty Circus.""",2022-10-05

Her statement on JP's participation in the election does not have any importance,"" GM Quader told The Daily Star today.Raushan Ershad does not represent the party and those who are with her also do not belong to the party, he added.""I, therefore, think her (Raushan) statement will not create any influence in the party and Jatiya Party remains united,"" he further said.Without mentioning JP chief GM Quader's name, Raushan in her six minutes video, alleged that the party has become weak and disorganised after the demise of JP founder HM Ershad.""The party is running properly. The organisation will have to be strong,"" she said, urging all JP leaders and activists to get united to bring good result in the next general elections.Raushan said the aim of the next council to be held on November 26, 2023 is to infuse new and young faces in the party to make the organisation strong.Golam Moshi in the briefing blasted JP top leaders who said Raushan is acting on instruction of certain people who do not belong to Jatiya Party.Out of ten leaders who were present at yesterday's briefing on the stage, eight were presidium members and two were vice president of JP.Almost all of them were given relived from the party in the last three years as they were siding with Raushan, party insiders said.Quader in the last three weeks expelled at least three senior leaders including opposition chief whip Mashiur Rahman Ranga from their posts.In this situation, tension between the two sides increased further, sources in JP told The Daily Star.Rift between Raushan, widow of JP founder HM Ershad and GM Quader, younger brother of Ershad started brewing following Raushan's announcement of holding the party's council.JP Chairman GM Quader recently on several occasions unequivocally said they are against using EVMs in the national polls slated for January, 2024 as according to him EVMs are nothing but a tool for forgery.On September 25, Quader said JP would not participate in any elections if EVMs are used.",2022-10-06
/business/news/further-delaying-climate-policies-will-hurt-economic-growth-3136506,Further delaying climate policies will hurt economic growth,"The world must cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least a quarter before the end of this decade to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Progress needed toward such a major shift will inevitably impose short-term economic costs, though these are dwarfed by the innumerable long-term benefits of slowing climate change.In our latest World Economic Outlook, we estimate the near-term impact of different climate mitigation policies on output and inflation. If the right measures are implemented immediately and phased in over the next eight years, the costs will be small. However, if the transition to renewables is delayed, the costs will be much greater.To assess the short-term impact of transitioning to renewables, we developed a model that splits countries into four regions—China, the euro area, the United States, and a block representing the rest of the world. We assume that each region introduces budget-neutral policies that include greenhouse gas taxes, which are increased gradually to achieve a 25 percent reduction in emissions by 2030, combined with transfers to households, subsidies to low-emitting technologies, and labor tax cuts.The results show that such a policy package could slow global economic growth by 0.15 percentage point to 0.25 percentage point annually from now until 2030, depending on how quickly regions can wean off fossil fuels for electricity generation. The more difficult the transition to clean electricity, the greater the greenhouse gas tax increase or equivalent regulations needed to incentivise change—and the larger the macroeconomic costs in terms of lost output and higher inflation.For Europe, the United States, and China, the costs will likely be lower, ranging between 0.05 percentage point and 0.20 percentage point on average over eight years. Not surprisingly, the costs will be highest for fossil-fuel exporters and energy-intensive emerging market economies, which on balance drive the results for the rest of the world. That means countries must cooperate more on finance and technology needed to reduce costs—and share more of the required know-how—especially when it comes to low-income countries.In all cases, however, policymakers should consider potential long-term output losses from unchecked climate change, which could be orders of magnitude larger according to some estimates.In most regions, inflation increases moderately, from 0.1 percentage point to 0.4 percentage point. To curb the costs, climate policies must be gradual. But to be most effective, they also need to be credible. If climate policies are only partially credible, firms and households will not consider future tax increases when planning investment decisions.This will slow the transition (less investment in thermal insulation and heating, low-emitting technologies, etc.), requiring more stringent policies to reach the same decarbonisation goal. Inflation would be higher and gross domestic product growth lower by the end of the decade as a result. We estimate that only partially credible policies could almost double the cost of transitioning to renewables by 2030.INFLATION AND MONETARY POLICYA pressing concern among policymakers is whether climate policy could complicate the job of central banks, and potentially stoke wage-price spirals in the current high-inflation environment. Our analysis shows this is not the case.Gradual and credibly implemented climate mitigation policies give households and firms the motive and time to transition toward a low-emission economy. Monetary policy will need to adjust to ensure inflation expectations remain anchored, but for the kind of policies simulated, the costs are small and much easier for central banks to handle than typical supply shocks that cause a sudden surge in energy prices.Using the United States as an example, we show how climate policies impact inflation and growth under a range of scenarios. When policies are gradual and credible, the output-inflation trade-off is small. Central banks can choose to either stabilise a price index that includes greenhouse gas taxes or let the tax fully pass through prices. The former would only cost an additional 0.1 percentage point of growth annually.If the transition is more difficult—reflecting a slower transition to clean electricity generation—the trade-off increases but remains manageable.The costs would be much higher if monetary policy were to lose credibility, a concern in today's high-inflation environment. If inflation expectations become de-anchored, introducing climate policies could lead to second-round effects and a larger output-inflation trade-off, as illustrated by the less-credible monetary policy scenario.Our analytical chapter shows how to design climate policies to avoid such a situation, curbing the impact of the greenhouse gas tax on inflation with subsidies, feebates or labor tax cuts. Is it reasonable to wait—as some have proposed—until inflation is down before implementing climate mitigation policies?We ran a scenario delaying implementation until 2027 that still achieves the same reduction in cumulative emissions in the long term. The delayed package is phased in more rapidly and requires a higher greenhouse gas tax, since a steeper decline in emissions is necessary to offset the accumulation of emissions from 2023 to 2026.The results are striking. Even in the most favourable circumstances when monetary policy is credible and the transition to decarbonised electricity is rapid, the output-inflation trade-off would rise significantly; GDP would have to drop by 1.5 percent below baseline over four years to drive inflation back to target.Delay beyond 2027 would require an even more rushed transition in which inflation can be contained only at significant cost to real GDP. The longer we wait, the worse the trade-off.Better understanding the near-term macroeconomic implications of climate policies and their interaction with other policies is crucial to enhance their design. Transitioning to a cleaner economy entails short-term costs, but delaying will be far costlier.Benjamin Carton is a senior economist in the International Monetary Fund's research department.

It will be slashed to 160km via Jatrabari-Padma Bridge-Kalna Bridge, another RHD official said.Moinul said opening of the 3rd Shitalakhya Bridge will directly connect the Dhaka-Chattogram Highway with Dhaka-Mawa-Bhanga Expressway.As a result, vehicles from southern districts would not need to come to the capital's Jatrabari for going to Chattogram, he said adding that although the connecting road is not a wide one but they will take project for expanding the road.RHD in May 2016 took up a project titled Cross-Border Road Network Improvement Project with a soft loan from Japan.The Kalna bridge over the Madhumati River, which is among 17 bridges being constructed under the Tk 3,745.51-crore project, will cut short the travel time between Dhaka and Jashore.The government later named the bridge as Modhumoti Bridge.People are now using ferries to cross the river at Kalna point.The physical work of the 690-metre bridge started in November 2018 at the cost of Tk 959.45 crore. This is a Nielsen-Lohse arch type steel bridge, which is 27.10m wide, and the first six-lane bridge of the country.The Shitalakhhya river separates Bandar upazila from the Narayanganj district headquarters.The only direct road connection is through the Kanchpur Bridge (Shitalakhhya-1 Bridge), which currently requires nearly 30km of travel, according to RHD documents.Once the four-lane bridge with walkways is opened to public, commuters will have to travel less than two kilometres to reach Narayanganj city from Bandar upazila.RHD in November 2010 initiated the bridge project with Saudi Arabia's funding. But it took over seven years to hire consultants and contractors before the physical works started in late 2017.The 1234.5m bridge with 834.5m viaduct is formally named as Bir Muktijodhhda AKM Nasim Osman 3rd Shitalkhhya Bridge.",2022-10-06

Liton, in particular, looked to be in good touch, smashing a total of four boundaries and a beautifully timed straight six off leggie Shadab Khan during his 26-ball 35-run knock. Things went downhill for the Tigers once Liton departed to a Mohammad Nawaz delivery in the 13th over. Mosaddek Hossain was trapped in front by Nawaz the very next ball as Bangladesh found themselves at 87 for four after 12.4 overs. With the required rate going above 11 an over, Bangladesh could never bounce back as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Yasir's five boundaries and two maximums at the death on way to his career-best T20I score only helped Bangladesh reduce the margin of defeat.  Earlier, Mohammad Rizwan continued his excellent form with the willow as he struck an unbeaten 78 to help Pakistan post a challenging 167 for five.

/tech-startup/news/beginners-guide-graphics-cards-3137076,A beginner’s guide to graphics cards,"We often hear the term 'graphics cards' being thrown around. If you're into high-spec gaming, you should be well-versed with the concept, but those who aren't into building pc or graphics-related work might not be as familiar. If you were ever curious about understanding the ins and outs of graphics cards, here are some key components to keep in mind.A graphics card, sometimes also called a video card, is a piece of computer hardware that is used to process graphics-related data. Processing this kind of data allows a clear display of images and videos with attention to detail. Computer motherboards generally come with this ability but the added graphics card allows more focus and clarity on the processed visual output. Graphics cards provide designated Random Access Memory (RAM) and a processor to process video and graphics-related data. As a result, the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the regular RAM do not take up a load of processing intense amounts of graphical data. Similar to the CPU, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is integrated within the graphics card body and does all the graphical data processing. After processing the data it makes an image clearer to see details, especially allowing the viewing of 3D images with a higher pixel ratio and helping with colour accuracy. This also makes rasterizing images faster, i.e. converting the data of an image into pixels to be shown on the screen. In short, the GPU provides an output closest to reality. A regular graphics card can process data up to a speed of Megahertz (MHz). For example, a 2.5 MHz GPU can reach up to 25,00,000 cycles per second.  But the current generation dwells in Gigahertz (GHz).  This means a 1.5 GHz GPU can reach up to 150,00,00,000 cycles per second. This measurement in cycles means the components can process data back and forth, as the input to output process constitutes a cycle. This is commonly understood as clock speed. Graphics cards also tend to have their dedicated RAM, called video RAM (VRAM). The amount of VRAM in a graphics card indicates how much space it has to process an amount of data. For example, a graphics card with a 1.6 GHz GPU and 12 GB VRAM can easily process 6 GB of graphical data without hassle. Video games and graphics software usually come with a VRAM requirement. Video games requiring 8 GB VRAM means that to operate smoothly, the graphics card needs 8 GB VRAM dedicated to that game when running.The Basic Input Output System (BIOS) determines how fast the hardware initialises when started. The video BIOS is the same. When loading a video game or rendering an image, how fast the hardware initialises or responds is determined by the video BIOS. Currently, graphics cards come with Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) BIOS extension, allowing faster initialisation that is more precise than regular BIOS.As for output ports, graphics cards come with multiple High Definition Multimedia Interfaces (HDMI) ports, display ports and Digital Visual Interface (DVI) ports. The ports support HDMI, DVI and regular display cables. Being a graphical processing unit, graphics cards tend to get heated - thus requiring a dedicated cooling system. Older generations used to come with heat sinks. Usually, a graphics card comes with at least two fans for cooling. But in a powerful graphics card, two fans are not enough. For example, if a two-fan graphics card were to have a 1.6 GHz GPU and 12 GB VRAM, it would overheat and fry up, due to the graphics card processing 10 GB of graphical data per second. This amount of oscillations or cycles would generate intense heat, resulting in insufficient cooling. So, for something with a 1.65 GHz GPU and 12 GB VRAM, a triple fan setup is a must. In some instances, modifying it with a liquid cooling system works quite well too.While all graphics cards may seem the same at first, closer inspection will reveal that different types serve different purposes, especially when catered toward gaming and/or professional work. For gaming graphics, cards are made more robust, with cloud gaming requiring specific builds. Ones meant for video editing or 3D modelling are more performance-oriented. Gaming cards are high-end versions of graphics cards. They are mostly performance intensive and their focus is on the output, meaning they will have more clock speed in comparison to VRAM. These graphics cards will have a GPU of 1.5 to 1.8 GHz but a VRAM of 8 GB, which is usually the minimum requirement for gaming. More clock speed is needed to run games at full potential, as video games are more output oriented. For example, to run a video game at 4k resolution and 60 FPS (frames per second), a graphics card would need about 1.8 GHz GPU and 10 GB VRAM. The 1.8GHz GPU is powerful enough to process the 4K graphics at 60 FPs. Some video game-specific graphics card line-ups are GeForce GTX, GeForce RTX Nvidia, Titan Radeon and HD Radeon RX.Workstation graphics cards serve the opposite function of gaming ones. Because workstations need storage, graphics cards that are focused on processing graphical data like video editing, photo editing and 3D modelling will have more VRAM than clock speed. In this case, a graphics card can get away with 2.6 MHz GPU and 16 GB VRAM, creating a video whose final output will be 250 MB and will have a raw file of 1 GB. This is because that file will work with multiple raw footage of 150 MB each, with animation summing up to 60 MB. So when working with this amount of data, more space is needed over power, as the amount to process is more than the power required to process data. As such, these graphics cards are more focused on VRAM. Some workstation-specific graphics card series are Nvidia Quadro, AMD FirePro, Radeon Pro, Cloud Workstation, Nvidia Tesla and AMD FireStream.",2022-10-07

/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/police-torture-victims-robbery-3136871,Police torture victims of robbery,"After they were robbed, they went to the police and lodged a complaint. But the law enforcers, instead of giving them the support they sought, brutally tortured them.The allegations were made by the family of Godadhar Malo, a 68-year-old farmer of Majhipara area of Dhaka's Dhamrai upazila.He filed a case with Dhamrai Police Station on June 18, accusing five to six unnamed individuals of entering his house and taking away cash, gold jewellery, and other valuables.About a month later, the Detective Branch of police got the charge to investigate the case, and on September 6, the officers asked Godadhar's daughter-in-law Shyamoli Haldar Rupa and her 14-year-old son Diganta Halder to go to the office of Dhaka District (north) DB in Savar.Rupa, 35, alleged that when she and her eighth grader son went there, the officers tortured her for three days in custody and her son for one day.""The DB officers beat me mercilessly and forced me to say I was involved in the robbery,"" the mother of two told The Daily Star on September 14 when she was still being treated at Manikganj Sadar Hospital for what she said were the injuries she received in the DB office.""An officer with a long beard and a female officer hit me more times than anyone else did. They strung my son by his hands from the ceiling and beat him in front of me. So I said whatever they wanted me to say,"" she told this correspondent.She was later able to identify the bearded officer as Inspector Yasin Munshi.She added that her family members had to give the DB officers Tk 1.50 lakh in bribes for her release on September 9.Godadhar, who filed the robbery case, yesterday said, ""My daughter-in-law and grandson were detained and brutally tortured at the DB office for no reason. I want justice for this.""Contacted, Dhaka district (north) DB Sub-Inspector Sheikh Farid, who is investigating the robbery case, and Inspector Yasin Munshi refuted all the allegations.""Rupa is staging a drama. She coordinated the robbery due to a family feud,"" Farid said.After the robbery case was filed on June 18, Arafat Uddin, sub-inspector of Dhamrai Police Station, was assigned to investigate the case.Police then detained a local man as a possible suspect and released him two days later, said Arafat, who was transferred to Dhaka's Keraniganj Model Police Station recently.Godadhar's younger son Shyamol Halder said he, Rupa, Diganta and a relative named Kirton Halder, went to the DB office on September 6.Sub-Inspector Farid, Inspector Kamal Hossain, a woman officer, and another cop then started interrogating Rupa. ""They physically and mentally tortured Rupa Boudi [sister-in-law] for almost 12 hours straight.""We were sitting right outside the room. We heard the DB officers continuously hurling abuse at her. They threatened to beat Diganta if she did not say that she was involved in the robbery. Boudi was screaming loudly.""Around midnight, the DB officers put Rupa and Diganta on a white microbus and left the premises.""Boudi could not even walk to the vehicle without help because of the severe torture,"" said Shyamol.A few hours later, the microbus returned with them, along with two schoolboys from Dhamrai's Boronalai village, he said.""Then, the DB officers took Boudi and Diganta to the interrogation room again and tortured them.""He added that the DB released Diganta and the two boys in the afternoon on September 7 and kept Rupa and Kirton in detention.""We could not get them released despite repeated attempts throughout the night of September 7,"" said Shyamol.On September 8, Shyamol and several other family members met Md Asaduzzaman, the superintendent of Dhaka district police, and told him what was happening, he said.Advised by Asaduzzaman, the family then met Mobashera Habib Khan, additional SP (DB) of Dhaka district.""Mobashera asked the DB officers to appear at her office with Rupa. When they did, Mobashera scolded the DB officers for torturing Boudi.""But Mobashera later asked Rupa not to withdraw her confessional statement, saying that she could only be released if she did so, Shyamol said.Later that night, DB officers raided Rupa's in-law's home in Dhamrai and her father's home in Manikganj's Singair in the name of recovering the valuables the robbers took away.""But they found nothing,"" said Shyamol, adding that the DB team arrested Rupa's relative Jibon during the raid.On September 9, Shyamol along with his father Godadhar and Rupa's husband Kamol Halder went to Savar DB office. The DB officers took signatures from all of them on blank papers, he alleged.Then, the DB officers forced all of them to say that Rupa was not tortured in custody and filmed their statements, alleged Shyamol.Around midday, Rupa was released from the DB office. The family had to take her to the Manikganj Sadar Hospital for treatment, he said.But Kirton and Jibon were sent to jail on September 10, said Shyamol. ""Kirton was also tortured in custody,"" he said, adding that Kirton was released on bail on October 4.DB Inspector Kamal Hossain said Kirton and Jibon confessed to a court that Rupa masterminded the robbery.""Rupa and her son were just interrogated.

/business/economy/news/loan-write-declines-3137086,Loan write-off declines,"Loans written off by banks in Bangladesh declined in the first half of 2022 despite the upward trend of default loans. As per the rules, banks have to keep 100 per cent provisioning against delinquent assets and the coverage has to come from operating profits.So, many banks show reluctance in writing off loans, which goes on to explain why the volume of sour loans has not fallen substantially.The outstanding amount of write-off loans stood at Tk 43,360 crore in June this year in contrast to Tk 44,083 crore six months ago, data from the Bangladesh Bank showed. It amounted to Tk 43,543 crore in June last year.Usually, loans are written off when they are entirely covered by cash and there is no realistic prospect of recovering them. These assets are shifted to off-balance sheet records.But banks are not cleaning up their balance sheets despite the escalation in non-performing loans (NPLs): defaulted loans hit an all-time high of Tk 125,257 crore in June, an increase of 26.3 per cent from Tk 99,205 crore a year prior.NPLs accounted for 8.96 per cent of the total outstanding loans of Tk 13,98,592 crore as of June.One of the reasons many banks ignore tidying up their balance sheets by writing off loans is to enjoy a higher net profit, a central bank official explains.A majority of banks managed a hefty profit in the January to June half this year thanks to the recent rebound of businesses from the coronavirus pandemic and the fluctuation of the exchange rate of the taka against the US dollar. Still, many showed unwillingness to remove the bad loans from the balance sheets.Lenders are allowed to show 50 per cent of the collateral as provisions against default loans. This means banks can avoid keeping the 100 per cent mandatory cash provision against NPLs.As per BB regulations, banks have to maintain provisioning of 0.25 per cent to 5 per cent for unclassified loans. It is 20 per cent for the default loans of the substandard category, 50 per cent for the doubtful category, and 100 per cent for the bad or loss category.Banks have to keep a full amount in cash in provision for the NPLs that are written off.Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, says the banks that enjoy sound financial health usually write off NPLs.""Although writing off bad debts helps them clean up their balance sheets, maintaining a 100 per cent cash provision is difficult for many banks.""Banks recovered Tk 565 crore through writing off loans between January and June compared to Tk 225 crore in the identical first half of 2021, bringing down the outstanding amount of write-off loans.Since the facility was introduced in Bangladesh in 2003, a total of Tk 60,402 crore has been written off. Of the sum, Tk 43,360 crore has remained unrealised.The amount of funds that was recovered through the process increased substantially in the first half of 2022, which Rahman described as a positive development for the banking sector.The enhanced recovery has helped reduce the outstanding amount of the write-off loans as well.Although the provision base has expanded to some extent, there is still a large provisioning shortfall in the banking sector of Bangladesh.The provision deficit stood at Tk 13,219 crore in June in contrast to Tk 14,007 crore six months earlier.Mohammad Ali, additional managing director of Pubali Bank, also said keeping 100 per cent provisioning is difficult for the weak banks. ""The capacity of writing off loans is not the same for every bank.""Shah Md Ahsan Habib, a professor of the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management, said writing off bad loans is not always bad.""It also shows how much of soured loans a bank can absorb. It is a matter of decision as well.""""We need to check and analyse data before concluding on the association between increasing NPLs and decreasing loans write-off,"" he added.Anis A Khan, a veteran banker, sees the fall of the write-off loans as a good sign.""This means that banks' efforts to recover bad loans have paid off to some extent.""    ",2022-10-07

/opinion/views/interviews/news/energy-prices-should-be-consciously-regulated-the-government-3137126,Energy prices should be consciously regulated by the government,"Dr MM Akash, professor at the Department of Economics of Dhaka University, talks to Eresh Omar Jamal of The Daily Star about the ongoing inflation in the country, as well as the role of the government and trade syndicates in it.Despite the global rise in energy prices, Bangladesh has at times seen disproportionately higher prices in comparison. But when global prices dropped, we did not see the energy prices here go down. Why is that?Most of the markets are not regulated by the government directly, but the price for energy, since it is a strategic commodity like, let's say, food products, is actually politically sensitive and therefore must be consciously regulated and/or monitored by any government. For example, in Bangladesh, energy prices should be determined by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) through a transparent tripartite meeting of all stakeholders, after conducting detailed public hearings about the real cost of energy supply, including the international buying price, freight charges, tariff, and internal transportation cost, taking into consideration a reasonable profit margin, etc. But this institutional price mechanism has been violated and the Consumer Association of Bangladesh (CAB) has lodged a legal suit against the ministry and BERC in the recent past.So, prices – of LNG, electricity, petroleum, gas, diesel, etc – have become subjected to a ""cat and mouse"" game that has been going on among BERC, CAB, and the concerned ministry. Sometimes, BERC yields to vested interests, other times CAB goes to court, and sometimes, using the indemnity ordinance for the energy sector or for so-called ""urgent reasons,"" the ministry determines and announces the prices through an administrative order.People have been experiencing tremendous inflationary pressure for some time now. Has the government done enough over the past couple of years to support them? How could it have been done better?
One measure taken for controlling essential commodity prices by the government in urban areas is the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) outlets that were selling necessities at lower prices. The long lines and the fact that even middle-class people are now standing in them prove that what the TCB supplied was not enough, and that it was just a temporary measure.
The popular demand is for rationing or cash expenditure support to target people who cannot afford what they need to consume. But some privileged groups enjoy rations and other indirect advantages.

The markets for our agricultural products at the producer level are highly competitive and there are numerous sellers of surplus products.

But for a permanent solution, the TCB must have an adequate, say, one-third of the total supply as a buffer stock for all selected necessary items – imported or locally-produced.
TCB also must have an attached network of small suppliers all over the country, so that price intervention through open market sale (OMS) can be resorted to at any time and in any place, whenever the strong syndicates try to raise prices by creating an artificial supply deficit or import crisis.
This long-term solution was preached in the taskforce reports of Prof Rehman Sobhan in the 1990s, when politicians were still not following the so-called ""mukto bazaar orthoniti"" (free market economics) – when business syndicates were not as strong as they are now, and when bureaucrats and politicians still had a pro-people vision or manifesto before them.
One measure taken for controlling essential commodity prices by the government in urban areas is the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) outlets that were selling necessities at lower prices. The long lines and the fact that even middle-class people are now standing in them prove that what the TCB supplied was not enough, and that it was just a temporary measure.The popular demand is for rationing or cash expenditure support to target people who cannot afford what they need to consume. But some privileged groups enjoy rations and other indirect advantages. In rural areas, vulnerable groups also have access to such facilities. But the system should be made universal.

/opinion/letters/news/plug-the-brain-drain-3137416,Plug the brain drain,"As a developing country, Bangladesh is a victim of brain drain. Generally, this issue is more prevalent among students who have access to higher education abroad. Although a large number of students migrate abroad for higher studies every year, the rate of return is declining alarmingly. According to UNESCO's ""Global Flow of Tertiary-Level Students"" report, 60,390 Bangladeshi students were pursuing higher studies abroad in 2017. This number is increasing at the rate of 10 percent every year. Most of them are settling permanently in those countries after completing their studies.In our country, the idea of living abroad permanently is viewed as something prestigious. The potential of Bangladesh becoming an incompetent nation is not visible to most people. Besides high salaries, developed countries ensure a more secure life. These facilities are still inadequate in our country.The inconsistency of the education system in Bangladesh and the inability to ensure world-class education is one of the reasons behind brain drain. When a research enthusiast realises that his/her lifelong dream cannot be fulfilled in their own country, he/she will naturally want to go abroad. According to the annual report of the University Grants Commission (UGC), 125 public and private universities of the country altogether spent only Tk 153 crore on research activities in 2019, which is only one percent of their total expenditure.Rich nations are also indirectly luring talented people from less-developed and developing countries to contribute to their own development. But it would be foolish to view Bangladesh's brain drain only through the few reasons mentioned above. Firstly, we must understand exactly which factors are discouraging a highly educated person from settling permanently in their homeland.State policymakers need to think about issues related to quality of life, employment opportunities, social structure, financial security, development, gender equality, and freedom of all walks of life. After all, a state can only become full of opportunities with the contribution of its most skilled people.Syed Rifat, Jagannath University

/opinion/editorial/news/it-still-accident-if-death-caused-systemic-negligence-3137306,Is it still an accident if death is caused by systemic negligence? ,"That residents of any modern capital city could be exposed to accidents related to septic tanks or uncleaned sewerage lines is quite unthinkable. Yet, this is what the residents of Dhaka are being exposed to everyday. On November 11, a 40-year-old woman, who worked as a cleaner at a car showroom, lost one of her legs when, while returning from work, three slabs of a manhole suddenly blew up around 15 to 16 feet high and fell on her. Needless to say, her life, since then, has been an overwhelming struggle.In the last several years, a number of such events have hogged the headlines. For example, on March 27, 2018, a septic tank blast in the capital's Pallabi area led to the death of a three-year-old while also leaving four others critically injured. On November 30, 2015, at least five members of a family sustained burn injuries in a septic tank blast in Dakkhinkhan's Faridabad area.According to experts, residents of Dhaka are being exposed to such risks because many of the city's sewerage lines are not maintained properly, and some were not even constructed following proper designs. Adding to its long list of failures, the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) has also failed to bring the whole city under one sewerage network. Thus, residents in many areas were either forced to set up septic tanks or connect their sewage lines with storm water drains.As of last year, 71 percent of household latrines in the city were directly or indirectly open to drains, eventually discharging wastes into the city's lakes and canals. Meanwhile, Dhaka's septic tank soak pits have also not been working properly because of their low capacity for soil infiltration. The culmination of all these and other factors has led to a situation where people are constantly exposed to such freak accidents. However, can such incidents really be called ""accidents"" when it is the apathy of the authorities that causes them? According to a report by this newspaper, Wasa prepared a 15-year sewerage master plan in 2015 to bring 100 percent of its areas under the sewerage network. However, only one among the proposed five sewerage treatment plants is now near completion.How long will people have to wait for Wasa to get such a basic service done right? How many more people will have to lose their limbs or lives before Wasa officials are held accountable for failing to properly maintain sewerage lines? It is embarrassing to hear our government officials constantly boast about our development achievements when our sewerage system – the most basic element of any liveable city – is in such shambles.We call on the government to urgently hold relevant officials accountable for these failures. It is unacceptable for anyone to be at constant risk of injury or death simply because of the negligence of Wasa.",2022-10-07

/star-holiday/news/kashmir-heaven-earth-3137896,Kashmir a heaven on earth,"After passing the passports and tickets to an immigration officer at Dhaka airport, I was lost in thoughts reflecting on the last couple of years. Though the worst days of the Covid-19 pandemic were over, the stagnant, restricted life was still vivid in my memory.How we all yearned for a pandemic-free world of unrestricted travelling!A benign cough from the immigration officer brought me back to the present.  ""Hello, Covid vaccine certificate please, ""he asked, reminding me of the post-pandemic ""new normal"" rules.During the pandemic, like many, I too had planned many trips in my mind. An opportunity came during the long Eid-ul-Fitr vacation and, my wife and I took it.  We were at the airport for a three-day trip to Kashmir.We reached Delhi after a two and half hour's flight. We grabbed a quick meal utilising the 2 hours before our next flight to Srinagar.Delhi to Srinagar was a 1.45-hour flight and an hour into it, Kashmir started to reveal its glamour and grandeur through the window. The views of the majestic Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas from above were superb.At the parking lot of the airport, Ferdous Bhai, our tour guide and driver, was waiting for us with a smile on his face. To our surprise, he could speak little Bengali.The beauty of the spring season in Kashmir kept our tired eyes open throughout our two-hour journey to Pahalgam, where stayed for the night.Located about 100 kilometres from Srinagar, Pahalgam, the jewel of the picturesque Liddar Valley located in the high Himalayas, is famous for its scenic beauty. By the time we reached there, it was already dark. After dinner, we had a walk in the near-empty local market.The next morning, on ponies, we set out for Aru Valley. 12 kilometres from Pahalgam, many consider this place the most beautiful of all the tourist spots in the area.We enjoyed the pony ride on lush meadows surrounded by mountains with snow-capped peaks and pine forests.However, by the time we reached there, the weather turned gloomy and soon, it started raining. This apparent setback was a blessing in disguise.  We enjoyed the rain with cups of warm tea. It was wonderful.Our next destination was Betaab Valley, another popular location among tourists and even Kashmiris, previously known as Hagan Valley. The renaming of the valley happened after the shooting of a hit Bollywood film called Betaab there.The entire setting was very scenic with the Lidder River flowing right next to it. With crystal-clear turquoise water, the beauty of this fast-moving river is hard to describe.Unfortunately, we were not permitted to approach Chandanwari, a tourist spot 8 km further away from Betaab Valley, as landslides, a common incident during the early spring season, triggered by rain blocked the road.That day, we left Pahalgam and reached Srinagar, where we stayed for the night. Our next spot was Sonamarg, which is approximately 80km away from the summer capital of Kashmir.The presence of the Indian military was noticeable in Sonamarg as it was near the Kargil, a focal point of the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan. However, other than facing a few regular security checkpoints on the way, we didn't face any adverse situations.The journey to Sonamarg, a gateway of the ancient Silk Road that connects Kashmir with China, became a pleasure trip as Ferdous Bhai from his driving seat recalled all the famous movies which were shot on this road.After reaching Sonamarg, situated at an altitude of 2730m with huge Himalayan Mountains in the backdrop, we decided to trek towards Thajiwas Glacier.It took us almost three hours to trek to the glacier site, enjoying a few moments there and coming back. In the evening, we returned to Srinagar and spent some time at the night market nearby our hotel to collect souvenirs.On the next morning, we started for Gulmarg which means ""Meadow of Flowers"". Gulmarg crowns the world's highest golf course and is also a popular destination for skiing.We hired a local guide and rented ponies to get to Snow Point, where we enjoyed a sledge ride. While returning, we stopped at factory outlets to see how famous Kashmiri pashmina shawls were made.We returned to Srinagar that night.Our stay in a houseboat at the Dal Lake in Srinagar was the tour's highlight. With a touch of luxury, we loved our stay at the floating house. We experienced a tranquil, surreal sunrise at Dal Lake.Later in the morning, we hired a Shikara (boat) to explore the lake. We also embarked on a sightseeing tour in and around Srinagar and enjoyed some Kashmiri cuisines like Wazwan, Kashmiri Biryani – which were distinct in taste and colour due to the presence of indigenous spices.On the final leg of the trip, we did some quick shopping and then started for the Srinagar airport.Soon, a sense of gloom engulfed us. Many call Kashmir heaven on earth for a reason.How to go there: One can go to Delhi by bus, train or air given that you have an Indian visa. Expenditures: The three-day trip of two cost us around 150,000 BDT.",2022-10-08

/business/economy/opinion/news/helping-families-cope-price-shocks-without-subsidies-3138021,Helping families cope with price shocks—without subsidies,"Amid ongoing food and fuel crises worldwide, general subsidies are making a big comeback as a way of delivering social protection to the population. In fact, according to a World Bank tracker, the number of social protection measures introduced in response to rising inflation almost tripled globally between April and September 2022. More than a third of these were subsidies, including for fuel, food, fertilizers, and fees (such as for electricity, water and heating services).The questions arise as to why subsidies are such a popular response, and why are they so difficult to reform. This puzzle lies at the centre of the discussions that will take place during the upcoming IMF-World Bank Group Annual Meetings (October 10-16). Ahead of these meetings, we offer some key points for consideration.It has been widely observed that subsidies tend to be politically popular for several reasons.First, most people benefit from subsidies, and thus, they may enjoy broader political support than programmes that benefit only a subset of the population.Second is transparency; for example, with an energy subsidy, consumers see the subsidised price on their energy bills.Third, since they are widespread and long-established, subsidies can be an appealing vehicle for responding to crises that affect most people and different sectors.Finally, governments can claim that they influence what people consume. For example, subsidising milk or eggs to ensure children get enough protein, rather than offering a cash subsidy that people may waste on so-called ""temptation goods"" such as alcohol or tobacco.However, subsidies are undesirable for a number of reasons. First and foremost, they are regressive—that is, they benefit richer families more than poorer families, and they are highly expensive. In addition, specific subsidies can have negative consequences. Fuel subsidies, for example, have serious environmental effects.Subsidising particular foods, such as bread, can backfire in terms of achieving balanced nutrition. It is far better to shift to transfers, and they should be in-cash not in-kind. And the idea that recipients waste cash on so-called temptation goods is not well supported by evidence, undermining much of the rationale for trying to influence spending.For these reasons, prior to the current global crises, many countries had been trying to move away from subsidies toward targeted cash transfers of various types. This trend should be accelerated.Why? First, cash transfers can be targeted to the households in various ways. Second, evidence shows cash transfers do not discourage work, often a key concern when it comes to those programmes. Finally, cash transfers generate local economic multipliers.With recent technological changes and improvements in social protection delivery systems, governments have more practical options for reaching people in need and can rely less on subsidies. While challenges exist, by applying various targeting methods countries can focus cash transfers on their most vulnerable population, or those who suffered the most as a result of the shock—or target more broadly.Having social protection systems in place that reach the most vulnerable is a great place to start the scale-up toward universality. This can also help in crisis: Leveraging existing systems is often by far the simplest and fastest social protection response in an emergency. But social assistance is only part of the story: Governments may also expand social insurance programmes to help households during shocks. Active labour market programmes like targeted wage subsidies can also help with the heavy lifting.At the same time crises can spark innovation. Often relatively broad, flat (or minorly customised) benefit designs can be used for crisis response programmes. This simplifies eligibility decisions and balances protecting poor people, helping a broader group of households cope with shocks, and other policy goals. There were many such innovations during Covid as countries sought to support people previously unreached by social protection. While there is no perfect system, there is enough evidence that social protection programmes can and do work, and it is time to use them to their full potential.Mamta Murthi is vice-president for human development at the World Bank, Michal Rutkowski is global director for social protection and jobs; and Ugo Gentilini is global lead for social assistance.",2022-10-08

However, her transformation to become a dancer wasn't an easy one; she had to pass significant obstacles to become one of the best dancers in Bollywood. Growing up, Nora was mocked and bullied for her dance moves. Her classmates would burst into laughter and mockery, after seeing her performance. This would break her heart, as the young girl would cry to her mother, to take her to dance lessons. However, her conservative Moroccan family wouldn't give her permission. The little girl was adamant that she would learn to dance, and thus, she started watching Youtube dance tutorials. In the end, persistence and perseverance win, and Nora Fatehi stormed into Bollywood as the reigning queen of 'item songs' in movies. Recently, the Bollywood diva has made headlines for her performance in the FIFA World cup music video. The actress is seen singing and dancing in Hindi and English in the ""Light the Sky"" music video with renowned musicians like Balqees, Rahma Riad, Manal & RedOne. Earlier, popular singers like Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, and Pitbull performed on the FIFA world cup stage. Nora is the first actress to represent South East Asia, India in particular, at the prestigious event in Qatar.Nora Fatehi was born and brought up in Canada. The young actress idolised Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan – and watched Arabic dubs of Bollywood films. She won many trophies at dance competitions in her college. When she had finished college, she received a phone call from a renowned dance institution to join their classes in the USA. However, her parents didn't grant her permission to go to school.Nora's father died after some time, and the entire responsibility of her family fell on the shoulder of the tender 18-year-old girl. The ""Kusu Kusu"" dancer started to work and send her dancing videos simultaneously across modeling agencies in India. After a year and a half, Nora got a call from an agency in Mumbai. Nora immediately packed her bags and sat on the plane to come to Mumbai in 2012.For the next two years, Nora worked in the Mumbai industry in a sporadic capacity. However, it took her five years to prove herself to her critics. The artiste was not proficient in Hindi at the beginning of her career, but now she has mastered the language very well. Apart from the Hindi film industry, she is also very popular in the South.The artiste, besides starring in music videos, has also become popular through her presence in reality shows ""Bigg Boss"", ""Jhalak Dikhla Ja"", ""Comedy Night"" and ""MTV Troll Police"".Nora's popularity has surpassed many B-town actresses.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/plus-means-positive-3138046,Plus means positive,"Tasnova Tabassum Parisa has proven that body types do not define beauty – it comes from the soul. The talented young woman won the title of ""Miss & Mrs Plus Bangladesh"". This plus size beauty pageant challenges the stereotypes of beauty standards and raises awareness against the culture of body-shaming.In an exclusive interview with Star Showbiz, Parisa talks about her journey as a plus size woman and more.How did you feel when you were announced as the winner?
When I was selected as the Top 5, I knew I could win this. But when they finally announced the winner, I went completely blank. I couldn't gather my scattered thoughts. I had to let it sink in. It was truly a magical moment.
What motivated you to join the pageant?



My biggest motivation was my mother. She always encouraged me to participate in extracurriculars. When I first heard about the pageant, I asked for her advice— should I join? She urged me to sign up for it immediately.
Since childhood, she made me learn how to sing and dance. I wanted to share these skills with the world. These are the reasons why I joined the pageant.  
You are also a dancer and a fashion influencer. Did you receive much criticism pursuing these, due to your body type?



Yes! Even as a child, I had to hear the jeering 'Why are you dancing with this body, you will break the stage'. I think all large girls can relate to this. Even now, when I am in live videos to promote products, people body shame me in the comments. Although I don't care much anymore, it is still hurtful.
 








Do you believe pageants like these can actually can help people fight against body shaming?
I think that the ""Miss & Mrs Plus Bangladesh"" pageant has already shifted people's mindset. Viewers are now more aware of the fact that body types have nothing to do with anyone's worth. People who would body shame me, now congratulate me.
I think this is a big change. There is still a long way to go, and we will need a lot of time to change the perspective of an entire community. But at least the pageant has opened a dialogue.
What changes can you identify within yourself?
I was always a person who loves herself. I'm like the character Geet in the film ""Jab We Met"". However, after the pageant, I find myself feeling more confident about my body. Now I know how to present myself in a more subtle manner. I feel less insecure about how I look, and more confident about how I am as a person.
 








How do you deal with hate comments on your social media?
I simple: I don't care. That's a good quality of mine, I will say. As I was active on social media for a long time and I am on the healthier side, these hate comments are my constant companion. I have found that the best way to tackle it, is to avoid it. I never let these hate comments come in my way.
What do you want to say to young people, who struggle with self-confidence due to body shaming?
I want to tell them is that you have to love yourself first. You have to embrace yourself as you are. You have to tell yourself every day that you are beautiful the way you are. You can never let anyone make you believe that you aren't.
 








What do you want to do to promote body positivity in the future?
Before the pageant, I didn't put much thought to promoting body positivity in particular. As I joined the pageant and participated in the grooming classes, I encountered many women who are depressed and anxious about their body type.
This made me want to help women work on their mental health— the way the pageant's grooming classes helped me grow more confident about my body. I want to open an institution where I can teach young girls take better care of themselves, and learn ways to be more presentable.

/business/economy/news/knitwear-continues-dominance-export-3138516,Knitwear continues dominance in export,"The knitwear segment has retained its position as the country's biggest export earner in the readymade garment industry and among all the sectors of Bangladesh. But the journey has not been smooth.In its early years, it had to navigate through a quota system and securing raw materials was not easy as imports were the only option. Now it is facing mounting challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine.The knitwear segment overtook the woven sub-sector for the first time in the financial year of 2007-08 and held the pole position until 2010-11.The woven outran the knitwear segment in 2011-12 and the dominance continued till 2019-20.In 2020-21, knitwear outran woven and recaptured the glory. And it continued in the last fiscal year as well as it brought home $23.21 billion, versus the woven's $19.40 billion.Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector 


Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector Even in July to September, the first quarter of the current financial year when the overall export earnings showed a falling trend, the knitwear segment grew 9.40 per cent year-on-year to $5.64 billion because of a strong demand amid the raging war and unprecedented inflation in the eurozone and the US.Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector.Fast fashion and putting on casual dress have increased the use of knitwear items in the last one decade. Nowadays, even executives wear casual dresses at offices instead of formal ones. Knitwear like functional sportswear is used as dresses for formal events worldwide.Fashion connoisseurs prefer knitwear items since it is comfortable and easy to wash. Moreover, product diversification has taken place within the segment.When Covid-19 brought the entire world to a screeching halt and damaged the global supply chain severely and businesses hit rock bottom, the country's knitwear sector put on a good show, surprisingly, as Bangladesh kept supplying garment items to the world amid the raging flu.The segment also felt some damage.The slowdown in the knitwear shipment was first noticed in March 2020 when earnings stood at a paltry $1.05 billion. It fell further in April, to $180.2 million.But it rebounded in the following month as exporters fetched $608.38 million since people were forced to spend more time indoors to avoid catching the deadly virus. The receipts sprinted to $1.16 billion in June.""It was surprising that the demand for knitwear items started climbing even during Covid-19 when the global supply chain came to a standstill. In fact, knitwear export has continued to surge,"" said Md Fazlul Hoque, managing director of Plummy Fashions, a Narayanganj-based knitwear exporter.""The use of knitwear items has risen as consumers spent more time at home. During their long stay indoors, western consumers mostly use T-shirts.""Historically, the knitwear sector was groomed in Bangladesh because of the quota system which started in the late 1970s and was in place until 2004.In the early days, knitwear manufacturers, particularly those based in Narayanganj, used to ship knitwear items as the European Union granted the facility of a quota system that was not rigorous and was less cumbersome. So, a strong market was created for local knitwear items.In fact, Bangladesh made the most of the quota system, sowing the seed for today's gigantic knitwear industry.The EU and other developing and developed countries later eased the Rules of Origin for knitwear items, allowing the least-developed countries such as Bangladesh to qualify for the generalised system of preferences in the trade bloc even if imported cotton and yarn are used to ship export-oriented goods.This prompted knitwear producers to invest a lot of money in the sector and broaden their manufacturing prowess.Subsequently, entrepreneurs also pumped money to produce yarn and other raw materials for the knitwear sector.Currently, nearly 90 per cent of raw materials are procured from the local market, cutting reliance on China, a major feat for the industry as it more than halved the lead time.Even five years ago, the US was not a major market for knitwear manufacturers.""Today, the US has turned into a major export destination for us,"" said Hoque.Three years ago, the export of knitwear items from his factory to the US was almost zero whereas the world's biggest economy is his main buyer now.Mohammad Hatem, executive president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said demand for knitwear items has not fallen despite higher inflation in the eurozone and the US.Competitive prices are a major factor in Bangladesh's success in the knitwear sector.""The export of knitwear items has kept rising and the momentum will continue in the future as well,"" Hatem said.Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, expects the dominance of knitwear in exports to continue for the next few years as raw materials are easy to procure and the demand for casual wear has lifted the demand for knitwear products.Currently, more than 1,200 knitwear factories are in operation in Bangladesh, employing over 14.50 lakh workers.",2022-10-09
/news/bangladesh/news/pricier-school-supplies-threaten-dropouts-northern-chars-3138526,Pricier school supplies threaten dropouts in northern chars,"Many children living on the impoverished Teesta river islands (chars) are getting closer to dropping out of school, owing to the rising cost of stationery items and study materials.Parents say they are already struggling to stay afloat due to rising prices of essentials. Now, they fear they will no longer be able to pay for their children's schooling.Getting an education in the char areas is as difficult as swimming against the tide and the rising cost just adds to the burden, they added.According to education experts, the learning loss that occurred during the pandemic caused irreparable damage to students.At present, dropout spike is expected in Nilphamari, Rangpur, Lalmonirhat and Kurigram schools.Last year, schools reopened after a 1.5-year closure. Since then, student attendance hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels.While primary education facilities may be found in some schools, higher education is still a far cry due to poverty-stricken inaccessibility.Chars are fleeting by nature, made from the ebbs and flows of silt. Not every char has a school and those that do, struggle to stay open. Like all char structures, schools are impermanent and need to be shifted often.Besides, teachers find it difficult to make the commute from the mainland, frequently missing classes.With only a few schools holding classes every day, students who want to attend from surrounding chars have to travel quite a distance.These challenges lead many to drop out. Girls get married off and boys find work to help with family expenses.While the government provides textbooks free of cost, without access to subsidised school supplies, it will be impossible to improve the literacy rate in the underprivileged char areas, education experts say.During visits to some shops in the districts, this correspondent found that prices had risen for all school supplies including school uniforms, shoes, bags, pens, pencils, erasers, sharpeners, markers, loose paper, notebooks, geometry boxes, plastic while boards, scales, calculators, and colouring pencils.The price of a rim of white paper used by students for making notebooks is now Tk 1,250, up from Tk 750 two months ago.Similarly, a rim of newsprint paper is being sold at Tk 1,150, up from Tk 700.Meanwhile, the price of ballpoint pens has risen by Tk 15-20 per dozen, and plastic whiteboards and geometric boxes are being sold at twice the price.Abdul Hadi (40), a rickshaw puller in Kurigram's Chilmari upazila, has child who's a Mondolerghat Govt Primary School student.He said, ""We have to cut back on meals in order to send my children to school.""Md Nuruzzaman (50), who's child goes to Purba Satunama Aminpara Govt Primary School at Satunama Char in Nilphamari's Dimla upazila, said, ""I couldn't afford a new pair of shoes and a bag for my child. The price of the cheapest pair of shoes is Tk 600 and an ordinary school bag is Tk 550, which were Tk 450 and Tk 300 just a few weeks ago.""Khalilur Rahman, the headmaster of Purba Satunama Aminpara Govt Primary School, said, ""The school has a total of 250 students, most of whom come from families who are river erosion victims. They come to class barefooted and without the necessary school supplies. We cannot but be understanding of their situation.""District Primary Education Officer Nobez Uddin Sarker, said, ""We request that the district administration increases monitoring in order to stop the syndicate responsible for the price hike of school supplies.""   ",2022-10-09
/opinion/views/news/churchill-and-india-manipulation-or-betrayal-3138321,Churchill and India: Manipulation or betrayal?,"History is often written by the victor, and there can be no finer examples than Winston Churchill's books on the Second World War and British imperial stories, in which he played no small role. But truth cannot be seen from only one perspective. This is why Kishan Rana's book: ""Churchill and India: Manipulation or Betrayal"" (Routledge, 2022) is such an important contribution to an emerging global history different from just Euro-centric narratives. Superbly researched, Kishan connected the dots to find that Churchill's record on India reflected part of his own limited experience with Indians, formed through his leadership of Indian Muslim troops as part of his early career, and his grand, but often self-serving, view of world affairs from imperial London.Churchill was right on the Nazi German threat but flawed on resisting India's road to independence. The Last Lion could not stop the slow but unstoppable deterioration of the British Empire, not with the emergence of the United States, which wanted no rival. In the post-Second World War period, America actively ensured that European states shed their colonies so that none would be strong enough to challenge her dominant status. American hegemony remains a classic ""divide and rule"" strategy, learnt well from the British.Kishan's book chronicles the Indian context and perspectives, which were swept aside because Britain was pre-occupied with the European war. Distant colonies cannot be defended from imperial over-reach, so India was lucky that Japan was too pre-occupied by China and stretched managing the newly conquered South-east Asia to launch any full-scale invasion of South Asia. Subra Chandra Bose's Indian Independence Army, formed from Indian soldiers captured by the Japanese in the Malayan battle (one of the biggest disasters of British military history), marked a significant turning point in the Indian road to independence.Managing huge empires has monumental consequences, much of which has been swept under the carpet until Indian historians began digging deeper into the fiascos. The 1943 famine in Bengal, in which more than 2 million Indians starved to death, happened under Churchill's watch as prime minister. The India-Pakistan split (which Churchill encouraged) resulted in the displacement of 10-20 million people and loss of life estimated between several hundreds of thousands and 2 million. The historical facts that India's GDP remained in absolute terms roughly the same at USD 1 trillion, and declined from roughly one quarter of global GDP when Britain took over to only 4 percent of world GDP at the time of independence, speak volumes about Britain's inglorious management of her glorious empire. Historian Utsha Patnaik calculated that Britain gained USD 45 trillion in today's money from her stewardship or occupation of India.Kishan has done a great service to history by meticulously judging Churchill's record. For Britain, he was a faithful, loyal, even great servant. For India, under the yoke of empire, it is not so glorious. The colonised must suffer because they must, even if the coloniser betrayed their interests. This explains why India today is ""on her own side"", rather than the side of the North Atlantic allies, in the Ukraine War. Those who preached human rights, freedom and rule-based international order were all brutal former colonisers. War and invasion rightly should be condemned. But history remembers who did the invasions first. No power comes to the present with clean hands. Lord Acton was right – there are no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests.This is a book to be savoured, and like a true detective story, it tells the tale of great men with grand vision and their seemingly small faults. Andrew Sheng is a distinguished fellow at Fung Global Institute.

/health/news/microplastics-detected-the-1st-time-human-breast-milk-3138821,Microplastics detected for the 1st time in human breast milk,"Microplastics have been discovered for the first time in human breast milk, raising concerns among experts about the health consequences for infants.Infants are particularly sensitive to chemical pollutants, according to scientists, and further study is urgently needed.However, they emphasised that breastfeeding is still by far the best approach to nourish a baby, reports The Guardian.Breast milk samples were collected from 34 healthy mothers in Rome, Italy, a week after giving birth. Of them 75% had microplastics, reports The Guardian.Previous studies have demonstrated that microplastics are hazardous to human cell lines, lab animals, and marine species, but the impact on humans is unknown.Plastics frequently include hazardous compounds, such as phthalates, which have previously been detected in breast milk.The mothers' consumption of food and drink in plastic packaging, as well as seafood, was monitored, as was their usage of plastic-containing personal hygiene items. However, there was no link with the presence of microplastics. According to the researchers, the pervasive presence of microplastics in the environment ""makes human exposure unavoidable,"" however larger investigations in the future may reveal specific risk factors, said the report.The Italian team identified microplastics in human placentas in 2020. ""So the proof of microplastics' presence in breast milk increases our great concern for the extremely vulnerable population of infants,"" said Dr Valentina Notarstefano, at the Università Politecnica delle Marche, in Ancona, Italy.""It will be crucial to assess ways to reduce exposure to these contaminants during pregnancy and lactation,"" she said. ""But it must be stressed that the advantages of breastfeeding are much greater than the disadvantages caused by the presence of polluting microplastics. Studies like ours must not reduce breastfeeding of children, but instead raise public awareness to pressure politicians to promote laws that reduce pollution,"" Notarstefano said.Another recent study found that bottle-fed newborns are likely to consume millions of microplastics each day, and that cow's milk can include microplastics, it said.Massive amounts of plastic garbage are poured into the environment, and microplastics pollute the whole earth, from Mount Everest's top to the deepest oceans. The microscopic particles are consumed by food and water, as well as inhaled, and have been identified in the excrement of newborns and adults, it reported.The breast milk study, published in the journal Polymers, discovered microplastics made of polyethylene, PVC, and polypropylene, all of which are often found in packaging.

/business/economy/news/pubali-bank-tear-3138496,Pubali Bank on a tear,"At the time of its denationalisation in 1984, Pubali Bank's defaulted loans were more than 50 per cent owing to a lack of corporate governance. The bank set out to turn around from its fragile financial health and it has not had to look back since then.Today, Pubali Bank is one of the sound financial organisations in Bangladesh and non-performing loans (NPLs) have fallen to as low as 3 per cent, way lower than the industry average of more than 8 per cent.""But it was not a smooth journey as multidimensional efforts had to be taken to improve the health,"" said Safiul Alam Khan Chowdhury, managing director of Pubali Bank Ltd.He joined the bank as a senior officer in 1983 after completing his post-graduation from the University of Dhaka.After serving it for nearly four decades, he is set to retire tomorrow, joining a small group of banking professionals who spent their entire career in a single organisation and went on to helm the pole position.In fact, Chowdhury was the one who had first-hand knowledge of how the bank was rebuilt from the scratch. In fact, he played an active role in improving the financial health of the lender.""Our main aim was to fortify the corporate governance, helping the bank become vibrant,"" said Chowdhury in an interview with The Daily Star yesterday.Capacity development and the change in the mindset of the workforce have also played a crucial role in the transition of the bank. And all contributed to the reduction of NPLs drastically.Subsequently, it came out of the list of problem banks in 2005 and the Bangladesh Bank withdrew its observer two years later.At present, Pubali Bank is the highest profit maker among conventional private commercials bank in Bangladesh.Its net profit stood at Tk 435 crore last year, up 17.4 per cent a year ago. Operating profit surged to Tk 991 crore in the first nine months of 2022, versus Tk 771 crore generated during the identical period a year ago.""We have achieved all these without compromising corporate governance,"" said Chowdhury.He cited customer satisfaction as the main driver for the bank's stellar performance year after year. Pubali Bank has placed equal importance on mobilising deposits, selecting borrowers cautiously, and facilitating exports, imports and remittance flow in order to diversify earnings.Embracing modern technologies and digital solutions has put the bank on a higher growth trajectory.ICT-based initiatives of the Bangladesh Bank, customers' expectations and demand, and rapid advancement in information and communication technology have significantly influenced the banking industry in recent years.Thus, the lender, which was established in 1959, has taken a leading role when it comes to introducing a number of banking services provided digitally.In order to take banking services to customers, it introduced an app-based banking product named ""PI Banking"" in August 2020. An e-KYC (electronic know your customer) and an instant e-KYC-based account opening system have already been rolled out.""We have invested a lot to ensure security and use big data analytics, data mining and artificial intelligence to reshape our online banking,"" Chowdhury said.According to the veteran banker, technological advancement will be the key driver for growth in the banking sector in the coming years. So, Pubali Bank has decided to rely less on cash and workforce with a view to minimising costs.He also touches upon the ongoing stress in the country's foreign exchange market, driven by US dollar shortages amid higher imports and escalated commodity costs.""The central bank has taken some good initiatives such as the restrictions on importing luxury items, increasing the margin on letters of credit, giving incentives to remitters and exporters, and fixing the exchange rate for exports and remittance.""""The country needs to reduce imports through import substitution by utilising every available resource.""Chowdhury suggested exporters search for niche markets to increase export and create their own brands.""We also need to focus on the Indian market to raise our exports and narrow the trade gap. Congenial environment for doing business has to be created to attract foreign direct investment.""During his long career, he worked as a branch manager, regional manager, division head, chairman of the credit committee of the head office and in many other positions. He was promoted to the post of managing director from additional managing director in April last year.He singled out his four-year stint as a manager of the Motijheel Corporate branch as the most challenging time for his career. At that time, the bank was categorised as a problem bank because of its high volume of NPLs.Management realised that if two branches – the Motijheel corporate branch and the foreign exchange branch -- could eliminate huge losses, the result would be enormous and shake up the bank, paving the way for it to move out of the ignominious category of the problem banks.Chowdhury was given the charge of running the Motijheel branch.""I took up the challenge because I have always believed that there exists opportunity wherever there is a challenge. I gave my 100 per cent and within a short time, the branch became profitable.""""The success generated a huge momentum for the entire bank and sowed the seed for its current growth trajectory,"" Chowdhury said.In recognition of his honesty throughout his career, the board of Pubali Bank honoured him with the Integrity Award for the last fiscal year. The central bank also recognised Pubali Bank as a sustainable lender during his time at the top.Chowdhury's parting advice for the banking industry: ""Human resources have to be developed to equip themselves for the massive technological changes going through the financial industry. Banks will also have to find ways to mitigate risks."" ",2022-10-09

/shout/news/depression-and-drainage-energy-causal-relationship-hell-3139206,Depression and drainage of energy: a causal relationship from hell,"As someone who feels her best when she's at her most productive, I have always been on the losing side in the uphill battle with my regular bouts of sadness. Every time I feel upset, my energy levels drop, which in turn hampers my productivity, and that makes me even more upset. You can see how that spirals into a vicious cycle of seemingly never-ending depression and fatigue.Until a few weeks ago, my defence mechanism, if we can call it that, was to simply wait my episodes of depression out. Before that, when I had first started experiencing depression during the early years of my adolescence, I would try to force myself to do some work – hobbies, household chores, schoolwork, anything. However, after a few times of achieving barely any progress in the short lists of tasks I would assign myself, I realised my approach to productivity was not going to work. Watching and following the advice of countless TED Talks about productivity, procrastination, and depression didn't work either.Ultimately, I decided to simply accept my ""nature"" of going into a mild hibernation every time the blues came around, but recently, a spark of inspiration reignited itself. This time, I decided to start by understanding exactly why sadness robs me and many of my friends of our energy, and knowing that has made some great changes in my life.To put it simply, depression negatively affects neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. These chemicals are responsible for regulating certain markers of happiness like healthy appetite, motivation and of course, energy levels.Similarly, depression makes us lose out on sound sleep. Either by reducing the hours of sleep we get overall or the depth of our sleep, depression compromises the quality of our sleep, which leaves us feeling less energetic and fresh. This discovery shocked me as I thought I was sleeping perfectly fine until I started noting how I feel after a night's rest when I'm not dealing with my blues. My sleep is indeed lighter when I feel upset.Brain fog is another symptom of depression and this can make taking even the simplest decisions incomprehensibly hard, draining people before they even get to actually work.Learning all this helped me navigate my fatigue better. I personally turn to designated hours of self-care every day now. Long showers, journaling, going out in the sun more often – these activities give my mood a boost and that's what I was looking for all along, ways to uplift myself and uproot the main cause of my fatigue, the depression. Instead of treating my fatigue like a cause of my depression, I view it as a symptom and focus more on my depression instead. Taking measures to feel better is what eventually gives me the energy I need to do things I enjoy and need to do.However, the journey might not necessarily look the same for everyone. Unlike me, some people struggle with depression due to specific instances in their lives and for them, the efforts needed to make themselves feel good can be different – change in sleep routine, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), medicine, exercise, therapy and so on. Whatever the case, the most feasible solution is to dig at the roots of the problem and the best way to do it is to consult a professional for guidance, but the main goal should not be solely greater productivity. It can be a motivator, yes, but the primary concern should always be the quality of your life and well-being because you are worth it.References:

/entertainment/tv-film/news/five-bollywood-films-deal-mental-health-3139201,Mental health represented in Bollywood: Five stellar movies,"Mental health has always been heavily stigmatised within the Indian subcontinent. This is particularly the case in the mainstream media, where we often see misguided portrayals of the issue, often being showcased as 'madness' rather than a health issue.In the past, mental health has often been reduced to a sub-plot, solely for entertainment purposes. This exacerbation of pre-existing stigmas, often through 'crazy' characters—usually destined to be sent off to an asylum—is a common theme in Bollywood.With the times changing, coupled with more awareness, Bollywood filmmakers began making a serious effort to address mental health with more sympathy and knowledge. This shift was important, because films have the power to influence the general opinions of the public.Representations of mental health issues in Indian films date back to 2005, with Aparna Sen's classic ""15 Park Avenue"". This film revolves around the life of Meethi, a schizophrenic, played by Konkona Sen Sharma. It brilliantly explores the impact of the disease on her life, her family, and her relationships, and it is one of the very first films attempting to destigmatise this sensitive issue.With each layer of the story fleshing out a new perspective about the protagonist, ""15 Park Avenue"" provides specificity and a much-needed representation of someone living with schizophrenia. Sen personally regarded this to be her most 'honest' film, given that she had first-hand experiences of dealing with similar trauma. In the same year, Sanjay Leela Bhansali presented his viewers with ""Black"", a film where Debraj, Amitabh Bachchan's character, struggles with Alzheimer's disease. This film was far from the usual, aesthetically-pleasing drama we expect from the director.Bhansali drew inspiration from Hellen Keller's autobiography for the film, to put forward a compelling story about a deaf and blind girl, and her elderly tutor. While it did not deal with the details of Debraj's conditions, it provided a good sneak peek into the early symptoms of disorientation and confusion, allowing people to relate and empathise with individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease.    In 2007, Aamir Khan produced and acted in ""Taare Zameen Par"", a film that greatly helped normalise children within the autism spectrum in the Indian subcontinent. Even after 15 years of its release, it is widely appreciated and referred to for shedding light on how the education system treats children living with these conditions.""Taare Zameen Par"" was also one of the first mainstream films that incorporated mental health within the main plot, through Ishaan and his struggles with dyslexia. The movie was not only a blockbuster, but also very successful in initiating conversations about learning disorders in otherwise conservative households. It presented dyslexia from the perspective of the eight-year-old protagonist, as a real problem faced by millions of children across the world.Another remarkable film starring Alia Bhatt, ""Dear Zindagi"", greatly normalised the idea of seeking professional help through therapy, eradicating the notion that these conditions are all made up and exaggerated.Kaira, the protagonist, is seen struggling with depression and abandonment issues. The film reveals the causes behind her mental health struggles, helps her achieve clarity on them, and ends on a rather happy note. It follows her journey towards self-development, healing and love.""Dear Zindagi"" also blurred the lines between the psychiatrist and the patient, showing how their individual approaches do not need to be strict and intimidating. While this film intended to connect more with young adults, it had a little something for everyone.  Finally, another Bollywood film that explored the importance of mental health and left a lasting impression, is Nitesh Tiwari's ""Chhichhore""—which deals with anxiety. While the film features the everyday adventures of a group of university friends, it does an amazing job of reflecting the societal pressures of expectations, especially within this subcontinent.This film is a cult favourite, and has been greatly appreciated for its attempt to tackle suicide prevention through mainstream media.Films such as these have not only shed light on mental health conditions, but have also been instrumental in initiating difficult conversations, by presenting relatable characters and circumstances.",2022-10-10

/business/news/trading-govt-bonds-takes-place-3140106,Trading of govt bonds takes place,"The trading of treasury bonds and bills took place on the stock exchanges of Bangladesh today, a day after their debut.There are about 270 treasury bonds worth more than Tk 2.5 lakh crore with their tenures ranging from two years to 20 years, data from the Bangladesh Bank showed.Of them, 222 treasury bonds were listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) as of August, with a combined value of Tk 59,359 crore. But they were not traded like shares and mutual fund units and they could be bought and sold only over the counter.But it changed for the better on Monday as the BSEC allowed treasury bills and bonds to be traded like stocks and mutual fund units, albeit on a trial basis.No items, however, could change hands on the exchanges because of a technical glitch on the day. Data migration could not be completed on time so trading was not possible although there were some buy orders, said the DSE.But several treasury bonds were traded on the DSE and the Chittagong Stock Exchange yesterday.Thanks to the commencement of the trading of government securities, Bangladesh has taken a major leap forward by making them easily available to investors through the exchanges and diversifying the product base.However, the lot of the bonds is 1,000 with a face value of Tk 100 means investors need to pay at least Tk 1 lakh or above to buy a single set of securities. As a result, small investors did not show much interest in buying them.While stocks are ownership in a company, bonds are a loan to a company or government. Because they are a loan, with a set interest payment, a maturity date, and a face value that the borrower will repay, they tend to be far less volatile than stocks.",2022-10-11

/opinion/views/news/smartphone-addiction-children-how-are-parents-responsible-it-3139896,Smartphone addiction in children: How are parents responsible for it?,"Addiction to digital devices, particularly mobile phones, has been a grave concern in recent years. Everyone, from children to older people, cannot think of spending a moment without electronic gadgets – be it for playing games, watching movies, or scrolling through social media feeds. People nowadays are suffering from a condition called ""nomophobia,"" or the fear of being without one's cell phone.Recently, I returned home from work to find my whole family using their respective mobile phones while sitting on a bed together.After a while, I joined them. My sister spoke to me briefly, but we did not have any eye contact while talking. I believe this is the typical daily case for most of us. However, we rarely even think too much about it. Even those who care seem not to pay attention to these issues within their own lives. We often blame our children for being addicted to mobile phones, but what about us? What are we doing differently? It is up to adults to start spending less time looking at screens at home. When my nephew sees me reading books or writing something, though he cannot read or write, he still gets out a pen and paper for himself. He draws whatever he likes, but at least he does not use mobile devices. So, if we want our children not to use mobile phones excessively, we should stop doing it first. In most cases, parents' obsession with mobile phones affects children directly, causing secondhand obsession. Again, it may expose technology-based interruptions in parent-child interactions.It has been a common scenario that we first introduce mobile phones to our children, so they do not irritate us when we are otherwise engaged. We do so to distract them while they eat as well, to avoid any fussy behaviour. Hence, children become addicted to mobile phones. Essentially, we do not want to spend much time with our children, which results in addiction to mobile phones. However, while blaming our children for it, do we ever realise that we are responsible for it? The earlier we recognise our faults, the faster a solution will come about. According to a World Health Organization recommendation, a digital gadget, mobile phone, laptop, or phone should never be within the reach of a child younger than one-year-old. Children between ages two and five could use their phones for one hour daily. But, let alone following the guidelines of the WHO, it is more concerning how most of us don't even know about them. The research also found that most parents do not bother at all to halt the growing habit of their children of using smartphones. In many cases, they are happy to see their children's different abilities when using a smartphone. Most parents do not find anything wrong with this preoccupation with technology and social media and go on to ignore the harmful effects of too much screen time on their kids. So, before claiming that the situation is out of control and that children are bound to be addicted to mobile devices, we must consider what effective interventions we are taking to end this addiction. Md Sohrab Hossen is senior research assistant at Brac James P Grant School of Public Health, Brac University.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/3-movies-and-2-shows-watch-following-world-mental-health-day-3140181,3 movies and 2 shows to watch following World Mental Health Day,"Yesterday marked the occasion of World Mental Health Day. With growing awareness regarding the importance of mental health, it has become a key ingredient for the plotline of a variety of media.These stories not only help normalise such issues, but also act as brilliant sources of representation.So, with that in mind, here are five such shows and films that you can binge, following World Mental Health Day.Atypical
""Atypical"" is a Netflix original series about an 18-year-old American high school student, who has been diagnosed on the autism spectrum—a neurodevelopmental disease characterised by confined, repetitive behaviours and social communication problems.The show takes us through the life of Sam, brilliantly capturing the diversity of the autism spectrum. While it addresses heavier themes like grief and interpersonal conflict, it blends all these themes within lighter layers of honesty, humour, and warmth.The show not only focuses on Sam as an individual, but also his family members and loved ones as the plot leaves behind subtle questions regarding what is actually considered normal.Normal People
""Normal People"" covers several important themes, including grief, loneliness, and mental health. It has been critically acclaimed for its realistic depiction of men's mental health difficulties, something which is usually not discussed in mainstream media.While general loneliness pervades the series, the last few episodes highlight the challenges of living with mental issues. It does not undermine or exaggerate the conditions, and while it moves away from the narrative that a depressed person is supposed to stay isolated, it hints at the finer elements like the lack of energy to carry out every day mundane tasks.All the Bright Places
This show is a popular young-adult film, which explores the lives of two teenagers struggling with their individual, yet complex, issues. While Violet suffers from depression rooting from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Finch is haunted with an unnamed mental illness that has symptoms similar to bipolar disorder.Although the film does not explicitly address mental illness, it skilfully depicts how solitary, tiring and tough it can be to live with any form of mental health issue. ""All the Bright Places"" also emphasises the importance of discussing mental health, and carrying out important conversations before it's too late.The Perks of being a Wallflower
Directed by Stephen Chbosky, the plot of this film revolves around Charlie, a high school student who is haunted by past traumas, following the suicide of his friend.As the story continues, tales of childhood abuse are unveiled and he finds it extremely difficult to move on. ""The Perks of being a Wallflower"" presents a rather relatable story, with the familiar element of bottling up of emotions. The film received a lot of love from the audience, due to the strength displayed by the protagonist and the use of literature throughout the healing process.  Silver Linings Playbook
This popular film follows a person diagnosed with bipolar disorder, as he seeks treatment and recovers from an event caused by a manic episode. The main character's reluctance to acknowledge his mistakes adds to the truth of his diagnosis and the overall portrayal of his character.
At its core, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a love story, that also illustrates the smaller and more everyday ways in which mental health may affect a person's life. What makes this film critically acclaimed is the honest character development, coupled with truthful depictions of the disorder.

We don't listen to our brains, but become a victim of our hearts. We might be strong on the professional front, but we are soft as a marshmallow when it comes to our personal lives.

/sports/football/news/mixed-feelings-about-cabrera-3140151,‘Mixed feelings’ about Cabrera,"Having met with the Bangladesh coach Javier Cabrera and technical director Paul Smalley following the recent performance of the national football team, the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) is now searching a path to counter the inconsistent performance of the men in red and green, which especially becomes prominent during a tournament's latter stages.The charges of Cabrera last month played two FIFA friendly matches, where they beat Cambodia 1-0 but lost 3-1 against Nepal in the second match. In June, Bangladesh suffered defeats in all three matches of Asian Cup Qualifiers but they showed signs of improvement in the first two matches before getting crushed at the hands of Malaysia in the third match.""If you look back, the booters drew with Nepal in their fourth match of the SAFF Championship when they needed a victory to progress to the final. They also suffered defeat against hosts Sri Lanka in their last match of an invitational tournament in Colombo while needing just a draw to play the final,"" said the National Team's Committee chairman Kazi Nabil Ahmed at a press briefing following a meeting with Cabrera and Paul Smalley at the BFF House today.""Similarly, in June, the boys showed their improvements against Bahrain and Turkmenistan during the Asian Cup Qualifiers but suffered heavily against Malaysia in the third match. Apparently the booters can't do well in the third or fourth matches. Why? We have discussed the matter with the coach and technical director and we have to find out how to overcome this problem,"" Ahmed added.Under the guidance of Cabrera, Bangladesh won one and drew two out of eight matches in the last seven months since the 37-year-old Spaniard was appointed as the head coach.Although Cabrera and Smalley looked gloomy after the meeting, the national teams' committee neither expressed full satisfaction nor dissatisfaction over the Spanish coach.With nearly three months left for Cabrera's one-year contract to expire, and no international engagements in this period, the question has been raised regarding whether Cabrera's contract will be extended or not?""The contract extension with the coach is a different matter because today we reviewed the different things of the national teams, such as team's outcomes, preparation, performance on the ground during their matches of the FIFA window in June and September,"" said the national teams' committee chairman.""We will sit again after four weeks and in that time, we will take our decision [whether to extend the contract or not] because this matter is not an emergency one at the moment,"" he added.Asked how much the committee was satisfied with the performance of Cabrera, Nabil said, ""It is not a matter of satisfaction, it is an ongoing matter. We have both feelings of good and bad. We have to work accordingly for the betterment of the players and the country.""  ",2022-10-11
/business/news/serious-debt-crisis-unfolding-across-developing-countries-undp-3140171,Serious debt crisis unfolding across developing countries – UNDP,"The United Nations' Development Programme (UNDP) joined on Tuesday the chorus of institutions and charities warning that a serious debt crisis is now taking hold in the poorest parts of the world.In a new report, the UNDP estimated that 54 countries, accounting for more than half of the world's poorest people, now needed immediate debt relief to avoid even more extreme poverty and give them a chance of dealing with climate change.""A serious debt crisis is unfolding across developing economies, and the likelihood of a worsening outlook is high,"" the report published on Tuesday said.The warning comes as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank hold meetings in Washington this week amid rising global recession worries and a crop of debt crises from Sri Lanka and Pakistan to Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia.Achim Steiner, UNDP administrator, urged a string of measures, including writing off debt, offering wider relief to greater numbers of countries and even adding special clauses to bond contracts to provide breathing space during crises.""It is urgent for us to step up and find ways in which we can deal with these issues before they become at least less manageable and perhaps unmanageable,"" he told reporters.Without effective debt restructuring, poverty will rise and desperately needed investments in climate adaptation and mitigation will not happen.The UNDP's report also called for a recalibration of the G20-led Common Framework - the plan designed to help countries pushed into financial trouble by COVID-19 pandemic restructure debt. Only Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia have used it so far.Its proposal was to expand the Common Framework's eligibility so that all heavily indebted countries could utilise it rather just the 70 or so poorest countries, and for any debt payments to be automatically suspended during the process.""Both will act as an incentive for creditors to participate and to maintain a reasonable timeline, and it could also remove some of the hesitancy caused by rating fears for debtor countries,"" the report said.It also recommended creditors should have a legal duty to cooperate ""in good faith"" in a Common Framework restructurings and that countries could offer to take eco-friendly measures to encourage creditors to write their down debt.""It makes a lot of sense,"" the report said. ""Not only have these countries contributed the least to, but bear the highest cost of, climate change"".",2022-10-11
/opinion/views/news/time-higher-education-bangladesh-evolve-3139961,Time for higher education in Bangladesh to evolve,"Four years have passed since I moved to Bangladesh from the UK to serve as a registrar, first at Asian University for Women and then at Brac University. I loved Bangladesh from the moment of touchdown in Chattogram: a country and region of transcendent beauty, resourcefulness and sense of the vibration of life.Coming from the UK, it is natural to make comparisons between the Bangladesh and UK higher education systems. There is much to learn on both sides. One of the obvious comparisons is that it generally takes far less time for full-time students to graduate in the UK than Bangladesh – three years in most cases, although there are variations. Higher education in the UK, and more widely, in Europe has, of course, had much longer to become established, with a remarkably strong research base, well-developed links with industry, and good practice in effective, dynamic approaches to teaching, learning, and student support.Bangladesh has an opportunity, however, to avoid some of the mistakes that have occurred recently in UK higher education policy. There is presently a reductionist tendency in public policy in the UK, more particularly in England, to judge the value of higher education on the basis of short-term career outcomes and starting salaries for graduates.We want to work in partnership with our students, not to see them primarily as customers, but to encourage their appreciation of the value of higher education. That involves challenge, self-discipline and personal transformation. Students are invited to become good, thoughtful, socially responsible citizens committed to a life of sustained service to humanity. We must help students to learn, encouraging active rather than passive learning, critical thinking, hard and soft skills, resourcefulness, entrepreneurship, and avoiding overemphasis on examinations, which stifles learning.Bangladesh faces a curious challenge. There are high rates of graduate unemployment alongside evidence of the need for high-level graduate skills to meet the demands of a massive social and technological revolution. Many countries have invested heavily in higher education as their economies move from low wage manufacturing into diverse economies based on knowledge and high-level skills.There are often criticisms of higher education institutions: questions whether too many people enter university and whether they are studying the right subjects. There are debates about the actual impact of higher education on student learning. The extent of university investment in vocational education is considerable, however, and often underestimated by commentators. The contribution of higher education to the economy around the world is well-evidenced, coming from research, knowledge exchange, professional training, workforce development, innovation, and creativity.Each year, concerns are expressed through the national media about the relatively poor performance of Bangladeshi universities in world league tables. Really, Bangladesh just has not played the league table ""game""; with a few exceptions, universities have not systematically focused on the criteria that inform the league table results. League tables are a marketing device that give a distorted impression, and the comparisons between institutions are highly questionable. Yet league tables can also be a powerful stimulus for institutional improvement and visibility. There is an urgent need for substantial, nationwide improvement in higher education in Bangladesh. Some universities are engaged in significant development and there are various national initiatives, but the clock is ticking as international competition grows stronger and talented Bangladeshi graduates are disadvantaged against their contemporaries in other countries.Prof Vincent Chang, vice-chancellor of Brac University, has observed, ""Of particular concern is Bangladesh's failure to establish any globally ranked universities at the time when the country is trying to become a diversified knowledge-based economy. Higher education institutions are generally regarded as the enabling vehicles for the creation of knowledge-based industries because they ensure that future knowledge workers have the skills and competences to become globally competitive. The reason for this failure is largely down to a lack of investment in the higher education system. In the last half a century, East Asian economies have transitioned from low wage manufacturing economies into diversified knowledge-based economies. To achieve this, they have invested heavily in their higher education institutions and unashamedly imported international expertise and best practice methods…""Facing the profound social and technological change of a new industrial revolution, Bangladesh can reap considerable benefits through reform of higher education. There are various ingredients that are necessary to a thriving higher education sector. Many of those ingredients are included already in the national Bangladesh Strategic Plan for Higher Education 2018-2030.It can take years to develop new programmes of study even when they address urgent national, social, and economic needs. Meanwhile, some other countries race ahead without those constraints. There is an imperative for Bangladesh to introduce a more effective and timely approach to academic programme development before the country loses irreparably to international competitors.It does not have to be that way. The national quality assurance system should focus mainly on outputs rather than inputs. Some years ago, the UK Quality Assurance Agency created an institutional review which involves a periodic assessment of quality and standards in each institution, conducted through a physical visit by teams of trained peer reviewers. Within an outcome-based system of national accreditation in Bangladesh, institutions with demonstrably robust systems could be given greater freedom to pursue programme development and educational innovation.There appears to be a counterproductive tendency to see the public and private universities in a position of opposition to each other. There are persistent challenges for private universities to introduce new programmes, to try innovative approaches to teaching and learning and to bring industry into the classroom. We are in the strange situation where some private university faculties are able to supervise doctoral students in leading international universities, but not in their home country. The restriction on leading private universities awarding PhDs in subject areas where they have demonstrable and sustainable expertise is also a restriction on the growth of research for national benefit, of high quality postgraduate provision, and an increase in the numbers of highly qualified faculty across Bangladesh.There is much talk in higher education circles of the value of ""internationalisation."" ""Internationalisation"" is about the higher education sector valuing diversity and functioning in an intimately connected, borderless world, where ideas and knowledge are shared. The theme of internationalisation is in the tradition of Rabindranath Tagore, who supported a concept of global community and who called for ""unity in diversity,"" expressed in the ideas for his own schools and Visva-Bharati University.The development of international academic partnerships should be evaluated carefully as Bangladesh becomes more attractive to international providers. Bangladesh may lose through partnerships which just lead students away to study in other countries, maybe never to return, or which damage good local providers through unfair competition. There is a need for genuine, two-way international partnership, mutual learning and capacity-building for Bangladesh. Indeed, other countries and their higher education sectors have much to learn from Bangladesh, which has profound expertise from the experience of nation-building and social and economic development over half a century. Dr Dave Dowland is registrar of Brac University and former registrar and chief operating officer of Asian University for Women.

If realised, that would be the highest since May 2022.Forecasts for the data, due at 1200 GMT on Oct. 12, ranged between 6.60% and 7.80%. Some 91% of economists, 43 of 47, expected inflation to be 7.00% or higher, suggesting the bias was for prices to go up further.""There is a strong pressure from food that is playing out,"" said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.The Indian government has introduced measures to calm local prices, including some export restrictions on rice to temper inflation. But consumer prices have remained defiant and stayed above the RBI's upper tolerance limit this year.A weakening currency is also not helping. The battered Indian rupee hit a new low of 82.32/$ on Friday and was expected to remain under pressure over the next six months, a separate Reuters poll of FX analysts showed.That is likely to pressure the RBI, which has raised its key repo rate by 190 basis points in four moves this year, to intensify its interest rates hikes.""Against a more hostile global backdrop and a stickier inflation trajectory at home, we now expect a terminal rate of 6.75% - previously 6.25% - in this cycle,"" said Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at J.P. Morgan.""To the extent the rupee weakens, there will be passthrough effects to the CPI trajectory.""",2022-10-11

The United States will be watching the situation closely ""over the coming weeks and months,"" she said.OPEC+ announced plans for an oil production cut last week after weeks of lobbying against one by US officials.

/world/europe/news/europe-blame-energy-crisis-says-putin-3141066,"Europe to blame for energy crisis, says Putin","Russia's president said Europe was to blame for its energy crisis with policies that starved the oil and gas industry of investment and said price caps would make it worse, as EU states tried to forge a deal on ways to contain soaring energy costs.Worries about the security of energy supplies were heightened on Wednesday when a leak in Poland on the Druzhba pipeline from Russia reduced the flow of oil to Germany.Poland said the leak was probably caused by an accident but it came as European Union nations are seeking to wean themselves off a reliance on Russian energy in response to the invasion of Ukraine in February.The Nord Stream gas link to Germany is now out of action after a leak last month that both Russia and the West have blamed on sabotage, without identifying who was behind it.President Vladimir Putin said leaks in the two Nord Stream pipelines running under the Baltic Sea were an ""act of international terrorism"" to deprive people of cheap energy.Putin said gas could still be supplied by one intact part of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline but it was up to the EU whether or not it wanted the gas.Germany froze the Nord Stream 2 project days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine and a German government spokesperson on Wednesday ruled out taking gas via that route.Putin also floated the idea of creating an alternative European gas hub via Turkey.""We could move the lost volumes along the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey,"" Putin told an energy forum in Russia.""That is, of course, if our partners are interested in this. And economic feasibility, of course,"" he said.Putin said Moscow was not to blame for Europe's sky-high energy prices and pointed at the EU's green energy drive, saying it led to underinvestment in the global oil and gas industry.The Group of Seven (G7) countries have been discussing a cap on Russian oil prices, a move Putin said would deepen problems.The impact of efforts to use less Russian energy, plus steep cuts in supplies from Russia, have been felt across the 27-nation EU, with gas prices almost 90% higher than a year ago and fears of rationing and power cuts over the coming winter.PRAGUE TALKSEU energy ministers were meeting in Prague on Wednesday to try to agree new measures to tackle the crisis.Most EU countries say they want a gas price cap, but disagree on its design. Some countries, including Germany, Europe's biggest gas market, remain opposed, arguing it risks choking off supplies.Germany and the Netherlands put forward their own proposals before Wednesday's meeting in the Czech capital - suggesting 10 ""no-regret"" EU measures, including a new benchmark price for liquefied natural gas, tougher targets to save gas, and negotiating lower prices with other suppliers, such as Norway.In neighbouring Poland, pipeline operator PERN said a leak was detected on Tuesday evening in a section of the Druzhba oil pipe around 70 kilometres (43 miles) from the central Polish city of Plock.The Druzhba pipeline, whose name means ""friendship"" in Russian, is one of the world's largest, supplying Russian oil to much of central Europe.""Here we can talk about accidental damage,"" Poland's top official in charge of energy infrastructure Mateusz Berger told Reuters by telephone.Germany's PCK Refinery in the eastern town of Schwedt, which supplies 90% of Berlin's fuel, said it was still receiving oil deliveries from the Druzhba pipeline but at reduced capacity.SUPPORT MEASURESThe energy crisis has had knock-on effects across the whole of Europe as businesses have passed on extra costs, squeezing household budgets.Governments are also trying to figure out how to fund emergency measures taken to protect customers and smooth out the distortions caused by the surge in prices.EU member Portugal plans to inject 3 billion euros ($2.9 billion) into its electricity and natural gas systems to curb prices paid by companies next year, the government said on Wednesday.In Britain, the new government set out plans for a temporary revenue limit on low-carbon electricity generators, which the industry said was a ""de-facto windfall tax"" on renewable energy producers.Rocketing gas prices across Europe and Britain have driven up the cost of electricity.",2022-10-12
/opinion/views/news/when-currency-not-arms-the-weapon-choice-3140111,"When currency, not arms, is the weapon of choice","After a relative calm since World War II, we are facing a situation in Ukraine that can flare into a catastrophic nuclear conflict. But it is not only the hard power of hypersonic missiles and nuclear warheads that can be used to score victories. Today, we have much less lethal, yet no less stealthy or tactically inferior weapons – these are the monetary instruments for sinking economies through gradual asphyxiation and disabling the financial capacity of opponents.The use of money for good and bad has a long history, going back to Byzantine solidus – the dollar of the Middle Ages – which projected the might of the eastern Roman empire. The monetary power gradually shifted to silver of the Spanish and later to the British pound sterling as the world's most valued reserve currency.The delinking from the gold standard by President Richard Nixon more than five decades ago was the beginning of the new era of the US' financial dominance. The gold standard was replaced by the dollar as the fiat currency, and all oil deals were denominated in dollars.The emergence of the mighty dollar was backed by gold, and the hegemonic transition in the aftermath of World War II that came with the rise of American geopolitical and military leadership of the Western world. The generous USD 15 billion credit by the US to the war-devastated European countries for reconstruction under the Marshall Plan of 1948 helped in this process.Today, the dollar has unparalleled supremacy. Almost all imports and exports are denominated in dollars. In addition, billions of dollars are transacted globally in the form of small private transactions, such as for travels abroad and repatriation of savings by millions of workers overseas. International transactions between businesses, countries to settle contracts, repay loans – all require dollars. Countries have to keep enough dollar reserves to pay for their import needs for at least six months or face the danger of default, poor credit ranking, and bankruptcy.Globally, USD 12-13 trillion is kept as reserve, much of which is kept with the Federal Reserve System of the US. These reserves work to the advantage of the US, which can (and does) run large budget deficits and take national loans equal to many times its GDP without much concern for bankruptcy.The dominance of the dollar and the hegemonic power which supports it have emerged as a sore point in the rising strategic competition to determine the global financial architecture.Jose Miguel Alonso-Trabanco, an international relations professional, notes, ""In this game of determining suitable financial architecture, monetary assets, control over resources are weaponised as instruments of coercion, manipulation, disruption, subordination and conquest. The realm of money is now at the forefront of rivalry for domination."" The US can and often does weaponise the dollar to support and extend their dominance. Such sanctions can be tolerated to a certain extent, but beyond that, it can backfire through powerful, destructive measures.Unlike the hard power of missiles and war machines, financial power can be used for both construction and destruction, from building alliances, to gradually weakening the economic power of countries. It can be used for patronage or denial, to gradually snap the energy of the ""disfavoured."" Financial power, coupled with another lethal weapon, the ""food diplomacy,"" can cause havoc on countries at the receiving end.Large and small nations can be subjected to its squeeze in different ways. For example, Bangladesh, during its immediate post-liberation period, was subjected to sanctions for selling jute to Cuba, leading to the deaths of thousands of people by starvation through denial of food delivery.In the context of the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the sanctions imposed by the US and the West focused on key elements of financial transactions, choking the Russian economy out of the freedom of exchanging goods and services.What impact are these sanctions expected to have on the Russian economy? It is difficult to assess at this stage. Russia, with about USD 630 billion in foreign exchange and gold reserves, was in a comfortable situation in the pre-war period. The impacts of sanctions are reported to be negative; it is observed by some that in February-May 2022, industrial production went down by nearly 70 percent, imports reduced by 50 percent, and debt portfolio increased to USD 300-400 billion.The Russians countered to stay afloat by denominating exports and imports in terms of rubles, adopting a quasi-barter system among its allies, or with countries dependent on Russia for its oil and gas. But the ruble strengthened, and Russia had to take measures to weaken the ruble for fear of adverse impacts on exports.So far, Russia is doing not so badly. But how long it can sustain the persistent pressure from the US and its Western allies remains to be seen. It could be a close call for a showdown.The key to this lies in the hands of China, another mighty economy with vast financial and commercial reach as well as hard power. It holds huge financial reserves (more than USD 3 trillion and 1,948 tonnes of gold). Allied with China, Russia can deliver a heavy counterpunch.Coercive weaponisation of financial vectors does not involve bloodshed, but it can still inflict substantial damage in terms of hunger and poverty, not necessarily on the target countries, but as unintended ""collateral damage"" on innocent ""bystander"" countries. Already, the rise of inflation and potential food shortages are sending ominous signals. Low-income countries around the world can only wait and see, and build up their own defences to the best of their capabilities against the unwelcome outcome of an ugly bullfight. Dr Atiqur Rahman is an economist, former adjunct professor at John Cabot University in Italy, and former lead strategist at IFAD.

/environment/climate-crisis/climate-loss/news/amazon-hydropower-brazils-people-the-river-pay-the-price-3141046,Amazon hydropower: Brazil's 'people of the river' pay the price,"The waters of the Xingu River below the Belo Monte hydropower dam, in Brazil's Amazon, used to flood the river's forested islands during the rainy season, allowing fish to glide among the trees and gorge on fallen fruit.But since the controversial dam opened six years ago, the forests no longer flood consistently, and the fish have lost a key place to feed and spawn, local people say.""Today, these fruits all fall onto dry land, so the fish can't get the food,"" said Josiel Pereira, an indigenous Juruna man from the village of Miratu, in Para state.During the dry season, in turn, the dam sometimes releases too much water at once, drowning sandy beaches and destroying the nests where turtles have long laid their eggs, said Pereira, who is helping scientists understand the ecological impacts of the dam's construction.""It has been very difficult for us to survive after the Belo Monte dam development,"" he said in an interview. ""It has caused a lot of impact on our food, on our source of income.""Estimated to cost at least 40 billion Brazilian real ($7.6 billion), the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex, the world's fourth biggest hydropower dam, includes a main dam called Pimental and the Belo Monte reservoir.Harnessing the waters of the Xingu, the dam generated about 5% of all of Brazil's electricity last year, according to its operator Norte Energia.But the huge dam complex, vigorously opposed by many indigenous groups in the Amazon, is also changing age-old patterns of seasonally rising and falling water downstream, disrupting the balance of nature and the lives of people who depend on it, scientists and residents warn.""I feel sad because before I could earn my living, my family's living, by fishing,"" said Pedro Viana, 51, as he sat on the prow of a boat, trailing a fishing net in the abrupt turn in the Xingu known as the Volta Grande, or ""Big Bend"", a 130-km (80-mile) stretch of river downstream from the Belo Monte.""Nowadays, I have to survive by selling farina (manioc flour) and bananas,"" said Viana, a member of the local Juruna indigenous community.Researchers and indigenous advocacy groups say the Belo Monte complex's main Pimental dam blocks about 80% of the Xingu's water, sending it through an artificial channel that feeds the power station.Currently, the dam sends a maximum of 4,000 or 8,000 cubic meters of water downstream per second in the wet season - the amount alternates each year - and 700 cubic meters in the dry season, according to Norte Energia.But locals and researchers say that is a fraction of historical water release levels. That has prompted Brazil's environmental agency Ibama to ask for new studies into the impacts of the dam's water release levels.A May 2022 report by researchers from the United States and Brazil, partly funded by Norte Energia, found a nearly 30% reduction in fish species' ""richness, abundance, and functional diversity"" and an overall drop in fish sizes in the Volta Grande as a result of the Belo Monte complex's construction.Norte Energia has come up with proposals to adjust the amount of water it releases each season, to be considered by the federal prosecutor's office, which in the past has filed several lawsuits against the company for environmental damage caused by the construction of the dam.In a statement, Norte Energia said the amounts of water allocated below the Pimental dam were intended to ""ensure the ecological conditions of the Big Bend"" and create flows that ""simulate the natural pulse of the Xingu River.""In particular, the periods of lowest water release were not below naturally occurring levels in some years, it said.But Andre Oliveira Sawakuchi, an associate professor at the University of Sao Paulo's Institute of Geosciences and an expert who has studied the area for more than a decade, disagrees.The Volta Grande's colossal water discharge and granite rock base had created, over time, an ecosystem of forested islands in the river which have adapted to the seasonal ebb and flow of the river, Oliveira Sawakuchi said.""Here, we have a forest inside the river. This is very particular and unique,"" he said.But the dam's engineering has caused a ""total disruption of this ecosystem. It's not possible to keep both things working completely - energy production and the ecosystem,"" he added. The Juruna people have joined with scientists and the Brazilian nonprofit Socioenvironmental Institute, or ISA, to propose an alternate plan for water releases from the Pimental dam that would provide more water for themselves and nature.Their counter-proposal is expected to be considered by the federal prosecutor next month, alongside the company's.Around the Volta Grande there are already high-water marks exposed on boulders, wide sand dunes along the shores and new islands in the stream - all land that had been previously underwater.The Juruna - who call themselves the ""people of the river"" - say the changes are worrying for communities that have since time immemorial depended on the river for navigation, fish, and water for drinking, cooking and bathing.For the Juruna, a confluence of low waterfalls and rapids called Jericoa in the Volta Grande is a sacred place. Whitewater cascades create swirling eddies in the river, which they navigate with ease in wooden canoes or skiffs.Wearing a traditional headdress of blue and red macaw feathers ringed with white plumes, Giliarde Juruna, 40, chief of Mïratu village, rued the threats facing his people.He said former Juruna leaders had been tricked by Norte Energia into accepting environmental and financial pledges that the company failed to live up to.""They promised us we would have energy for free,"" he said. But at about 500 real a month per household, the electricity generated by the dam costs more than most in the community can afford, he complained.In a statement, the company said it had carried out ""more than 100 socio-environmental projects"" in the Volta Grande since 2011, complying with an agreement with Ibama.These include installing fish farms and cocoa plantations and bringing potable water access, sanitation and sewage systems to riverside communities, as well as providing healthcare access to families in the ""dam's area of influence"".Local people say those changes do little to benefit them.In Miratu, Josiel Pereira pointed to dead fish floating in one of the fish farms. He said the fish were an introduced species that were not well adapted to the area, unlike the once-abundant native species like pacu. Without enough fish in the Xingu, Silvia Da Cruiz, an indigenous mother of four in Miratu, said she has to buy meat, chicken and processed foods to feed her family, raising the cost of living and forcing families like hers into the cash economy.""It's not true that Belo Monte dam's energy is clean,"" said Mariel Nakane, an economist working with ISA. ""(Brazilians) are paying less for the hydroelectric power energy… but the costs are here on the people who live in the Volta Grande.""Originally published on: https://www.context.news/nature/brazils-people-of-the-river-pay-price-fo...",2022-10-12
/sports/cricket/news/malan-hits-82-england-beat-australia-eight-runs-3140981,Malan hits 82 as England beat Australia by eight runs,"Dawid Malan's 82 and disciplined bowling from England helped the visitors win the second Twenty20 international against Australia by eight runs Wednesday to seal the series and give them a confidence boost heading into the World Cup.Malan shared a crucial 92-run stand in Canberra with Moeen Ali (44) as England compiled 178-7 against a full-strength Australian attack.Despite Mitchell Marsh hitting 45 off 29 balls and Tim David 40 off 23, the hosts fell short.Sam Curran took 3-25 to ensure England won the three-match series 2-0 with a game left on Friday in a setback to the World Cup champions.""Really satisfying win after losing the toss as well and setting a target,"" said England skipper Jos Buttler.""I think we showed great character and Malan played fantastically well to anchor the innings.""Malan hit seven fours and four sixes in his 49-ball knock to rescue the visitors after they slumped to 54-4 in the ninth over.Ali was also impressive after Australian captain Aaron Finch won the toss and chose to bowl, making five changes to the side that also lost by eight runs in Perth.Pace spearheads Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, along with spinner Adam Zampa all returned for the hosts after being rested for the first T20.Buttler fell to Cummins on 17, with Zampa holding a difficult high catch.Alex Hales, who blasted 84 from 51 balls in Perth, lasted just seven balls for his four runs before holing out to David Warner off Marcus Stoinis.Star allrounder Ben Stokes' ordinary recent form continued, bowled by Zampa for seven, and when Harry Brook got an edge off Stoinis they were on the back foot at 54-4.But Malan was rock-solid, expertly finding the gaps to reach his 14th half-century.Zampa finally broke the partnership, tempting Ali into another big hit and he was caught on the ropes before a late flurry from Malan, who was out in the last over.""We were really poor in the field, sloppy, dropped a couple of chances, especially when we had them four down in the first 10 overs,"" said Finch.England rested pacemen Mark Wood and Chris Woakes but they still found a way to restrict Australia.Finch dropped down the order in recent matches, but returned to partner Warner for the first time since their Sri Lanka tour in the middle of the year.But he never settled and again fell cheaply, out for 13.Warner, who has been in form, followed three balls later for four to leave Australia struggling at 22-2 in the fifth over.Glenn Maxwell's recent poor form continued, out for eight, before Marsh and Marcus Stoinis put on a quick-fire 40-run partnership to keep them in contention.Stoinis went for 22, followed by Marsh, with Australia's fate resting with David and Matthew Wade. They needed 59 of the last five overs but were unable to deliver the fireworks required.

/shout/news/should-rickshaws-be-restricted-main-roads-3141096,Should rickshaws be restricted on main roads?,"In 2019, the city corporations made the decision to ban rickshaws from three major roads in Dhaka. The reason? To manage and reduce traffic congestion. Here we are, three years later, and the traffic has not yet improved. In fact, it has taken a drastic turn for the worse in recent times. It is easy to see where the government got the idea of banning rickshaws. The roads of this city are not wide enough to have space for separate lanes for different kinds of vehicles. As a result, the thoroughfares almost always witness traffic filled with a mixture of cars, buses, rickshaws, cycles, CNGs, etc.While motorised vehicles are more or less able to match in speed and performance, rickshaws, being man-driven, are slower. Vehicles of different capacities being on the same roads like this can be seen as a hindrance to traffic flow. It might even be accused of being a cause of the breakdown of traffic discipline, and the overall haphazard and dangerous driving habits that we see on the roads. However, what other option is there? The reason why rickshaws are so popular and occupy the roads to such a degree is that they are the best transport method for a large majority. The public transport system in our country is unreliable at best and for many, CNGs are only affordable if one has to make a long commute. Not only that, the deplorable conditions of the sidewalks make Dhaka an unwalkable city.In truth, banning rickshaws or even restricting them to alleyways is not a feasible option at all. Most of these alleys are uncomfortably narrow and barely allow a file of rickshaws to pass through without becoming blocked. They are battered as a result of poor planning and rough use, and there is hardly any proper repair done to them. It is cruel to ask rickshaw-pullers to drive only through these alleys.Furthermore, taking the convoluted routes through alleyways will most likely consume more of the rickshaw-pullers' time for each trip. However, since the destination is the same, their pay will continue to be the same as well. This will result in a disproportionate income for their labour. Many commuters will also probably face difficulties and opt for other methods of transport, once again impacting the livelihood of the rickshaw-pullers.During the Covid-19 pandemic, the income of these rickshaw-pullers plummeted drastically as a result of the decreased number of passengers and many had to rely on loans to make ends meet, particularly since no relief was offered to them. Moreover, the pandemic resulted in the loss of jobs in both rural and urban areas. Many of the people who lost these jobs are now taking up the job of pulling rickshaws in Dhaka. This in turn has led to further oversaturation in an already saturated market, thus, it is harder than ever for rickshaw-pullers to make a proper livelihood.From our privileged position, it is easy to opine on what should and should not be done. However, the people who are driving these rickshaws are in a different socioeconomic situation than us. Most of them cannot afford to entertain any ideas of such restrictions. Thus, unless a proper alternative mode of income can be found for these people and an alternative method of transport for commuters, restrictions simply cannot be imposed on rickshaws.Zaima is a struggling student, a failed guitarist and a poet in need of better poetic ideas.

/life-living/travel/news/your-complete-guide-visiting-the-sundarbans-3140886,Your complete guide to visiting the Sundarbans ,"The Sundarbans is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places in Bangladesh, and easily one of the best tourist attractions in the country. This mangrove forest is the largest in the world, and is densely populated with various trees, and diverse wildlife. This time of the year — from October to March —is best to visit this treasure trove of natural beauty as the weather is perfect, not too warm with low chances of rain or storm. But how do we get there and what's there to see? This article shall serve as your guide.       Here are the top 5 places to visit in the Sundarbans.Located in the southeast corner of the Sundarbans, this clean, beautiful, and serene beach is often interrupted by tiger roars. The sandy beach is spotted with red crabs and the area contains three tiger hills. It is also a great base for safaris, and bird-watching. If you are lucky, you may even spot a Royal Bengal Tiger! Apart from these, from a historical aspect, remnants of salt cultivation from the British period can still be found here.Hiron Point is the prime spot from where the diverse wildlife of the Sundarbans can be explored. It is a protected sanctuary for wildlife, and visitors can take a walk through the long wooden walkway to explore the various species of monkeys, deer, and reptiles. There is also a rest house near Hiron Point, the Neelkomol.  Kachikhali will give you a scope to absorb the raw natural beauty of the Sundarbans and feel the essence of the wildlife sanctuary located there. It is situated 14km east of Kotka and features a dense forest facing the Bay of Bengal. It is populated with numerous marine and land creatures that one can see. Kachikhali is also known as Tiger Point and has a rest house.   Karamjal is another place that is known for its dense population of wildlife. It is a popular tourist spot where people come to see the various species of wildlife roaming about the Sundarbans. This place is also used as the Deer Breeding Centre and Wildlife Reserving Centre. You can take a look at the diverse wildlife including dolphins, crocodiles, deer, wild boars, ducks, monkeys, and the majestic tigers.   Dublar Chor is a highly popular island in the Sundarbans, owing to its various types of fish, festivities, and breath-taking sunsets. Almost half of the year, this island remains submerged underwater. During the third week of November, under the full moon, the Hindu community observes their holy festival, Rash Mela, and devotees from all over the country come to join. However, this holy occasion is no longer open for tourists. How to go?
It is not practicable to go to the Sundarbans directly from Dhaka, although there were a few ships that used to take this route in the past, but now they are mostly halted or irregular. Moreover, choosing this method of travelling would stretch your trip to 5-6 days on a ship.
The easiest and most practiced method is to take a bus to Khulna or Mongla and then your trip provider will set you up on a ship. Although Khulna has better facilities in many ways, the completion of The Padma Bridge has made Mongla a popular docking point as well.
Alternatively, you can travel to Jessore by plane and then take a one-hour bus ride to Khulna. Most tour operators provide a 2-3 days tour and then drop guests back at the spot where they were received from. Furthermore, to visit the Sundarbans, a forest permit is required.     
Things to know
While visiting a forest, there are a few things you ought to keep in mind. Firstly, your attire must be light and simple, and bright colours should be avoided at any cost as they attract wildlife. Furthermore, perfumes cannot be worn.
Silence must be maintained at all times and people should walk in a straight line and stay together. Most importantly, visitors must have sharp eyes and stay vigilant all the time as many unprecedented mishaps can occur. Taking a dip in the water is prohibited and so is roaming about without the supervision of forest guards.

/sports/cricket/news/we-were-always-behind-the-game-shakib-3140736,We were always behind in the game: Shakib,"Bangladesh Test and T20I skipper Shakib Al Hasan admitted that the Tigers were always behind in their chase of a steep target against New Zealand in their T20I tri-nation series encounter in Christchurch on Wednesday. Chasing a mammoth 209-run target, Bangladesh were restricted to 160 for seven despite a fifty from skipper Shakib.""New Zealand put on a very good total and we were always behind in the game. But we should have scored maybe 15-20 more runs to close down the gap more as that would have been ideal,"" Shakib said at the post-match presentation following their 48-run loss to New Zealand that saw the Tigers crash out of the Tri-nation series. Shakib pointed out the area the Tigers have been struggling in recently.  ""We kept on losing wickets in the middle and that cost us the game. If you look at our last three games, it has been the same pattern. After 10 overs, we have been losing wickets consistently. We lose wickets every two overs and that is not helping us in getting the momentum and we are left forcing to build innings,"" Shakib added. Bangladesh got off to a promising start on a sporting wicket at the Hagley Oval today. The Tigers, despite losing both their openers, scored 52 in the Powerplay -- the most they have scored in the first six overs in the series. But the Tigers lost way in the middle. Bangladesh were 90 for two approaching the halfway stage of the game. From there, the Tigers lost wickets in a cluster and were reduced to five for 120 in 14.2 overs. Shakib fought valiantly but his 44-ball 70 did not amount to much as no other batter could capitalise on their starts. Bangladesh have one more game to play -- against Pakistan tomorrow -- in the series. And Shakib hoped to end the series on a positive note ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia later this month.  
 
""We are not that far [from forming a settled playing eleven], we have a few areas we need to fix. Actually, we do not have many options to be honest. We know what exactly the World Cup team is, we were just trying to give some guys a game to understand the best combination for the World Cup. We'll approach tomorrow to try and win the game. That's why it is an important game tomorrow,"" Shakib said.

/sports/cricket/news/shakibs-70-vain-tigers-lose-against-nz-3140696,Shakib’s 70 in vain as Tigers lose against NZ,"Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan scored a fifty but a 200-plus target still proved to be too much for the Tigers as they suffered a 48-run defeat against hosts New Zealand in the T20I Tri-nation series at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Wednesday. The defeat also saw Bangladesh crash out of the T20I tri-nation series with three losses on the trot as New Zealand and Pakistan make it to the final, scheduled to be held at the same venue on Friday. Unlike the other two matches that Tigers lost in this series, Bangladesh batters were able to show intent in their chase of a 209-run target today. Shakib, in particular, looked to be in good touch during his 44-ball 70.However, despite Shakib's knock, Bangladesh were restricted to 160 for seven as they lacked the firepower at the death that is required to get over the line while in chase of such a big target.  The Tigers' team management faced backlash for having Shakib come down at number seven in their previous game in the series against New Zealand, which the Tigers lost by eight wickets. Coming at number four today, Shakib looked to be bold and innovative throughout his innings. The left-hander made his intentions clear right from the word go as he got off the mark by charging down the ground to hit Michael Bracewell for a boundary off the very first ball he faced. He hit a total of eight boundaries and one maximum and also starred in a 43-run stand with Soumya Sarkar, who scored 17-ball 23 in his first game for Bangladesh in over 11 months. Chasing a huge total, Bangladesh managed to get a positive start. Liton Das looked good during his 16-ball 23 as the Tigers amassed 52 for two wickets in the Powerplay. Shakib tried to keep the Tigers in the game but Bangladesh failed to match the tempo as the required rate skyrocketed over 18 an over at one point of the game. For New Zealand, pacer Adam Milne led the attack as he finished with figures of three for 24 in four overs. Earlier, a 40-ball 64 from Devon Conway and another rapid 24-ball 60 from Glenn Phillips helped New Zealand post 208 for five -- only the fifth time that a score above 200 was set at this venue.

""National solutions are not a way forward.""EU energy ministers meet in Prague on Wednesday to attempt to provide clearer instructions on what the European Commission should propose as the bloc's next emergency energy measure.But countries still cannot decide what they want.With gas prices almost 90% higher than a year ago, most EU countries say they want a gas price cap, but disagree on its design. Some countries, including Germany, Europe's biggest gas market, remain opposed.Talks among EU leaders last week did little to clarify the next steps. Those discussions ""went in all directions"", one EU diplomat said - referring to the numerous options being floated, including a price cap on all gas, pipeline gas, or just gas used to produce electricity.Another EU diplomat said no ""unified signal"" had come out of the leaders' talks. ""I'd say expectations are low,"" the diplomat said of Wednesday's meeting.Others were more hopeful a consensus was emerging. The senior EU official said countries were leaning towards the ""Iberian model"" of capping the price of gas used for power generation as a quick fix.Spain and Portugal implemented that scheme in June, which helped curb local power prices. The idea has gained support among other countries, although some worry it could raise EU gas demand, since Spain's gas use increased under the measure.EU countries have already rushed through emergency energy windfall profit levies, gas storage filling obligations, and electricity demand curbs to address the surge in energy prices driven by Russia slashing gas supplies since it invaded Ukraine.But the pressure to agree more EU-wide measures has increased after Germany said it would spend up to 200 billion euros to shield its consumers and businesses from high energy costs - prompting a backlash from some countries about the uneven rollout of national support.",2022-10-12

/opinion/views/news/who-benefits-the-raids-healthcare-facilities-3141081,Who benefits from the raids at healthcare facilities?,"Every year, we see raids taking place at hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centres, and other healthcare facilities across Bangladesh. This year, too, the government ran a countrywide campaign against illegal healthcare facilities, shutting down more than 1,600 such institutions. No one can say how many unregistered hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centres and blood banks exist in the country. According to some estimates, the number of illegal hospitals is two or three times that of the legal ones.Healthcare providers cannot operate in secret, so how is it that so many unauthorised institutions have been able to run their activities? The more important question is: why are more and more people going to private institutions for healthcare?Over the years, budget allocations for the health sector as a proportion of the GDP have steadily declined in Bangladesh, which is now below one percent. Bangladesh is ranked the lowest in South Asia in terms of per capita government expenditure on healthcare. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), 49 percent of the country's population do not receive quality healthcare services. In 2020, the health sector was running with less than 10 doctors, nurses, and midwives for every 10,000 people. And the skills of the majority of doctors, nurses, and midwives in the country do not meet the standards set by WHO.Most of the hospitals that have been declared illegal by the government were occupied by doctors who are registered with Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC). Assistants at operation theatres (OTs) perform minor to major surgeries. There are not enough nurses; in many places, cleaners work as nurses. Smoke from the kitchen enters OTs at times, and used equipment is used to treat patients. Hospitals have been found to accommodate patients far beyond their capacity. Quality of lab work is substandard, and not all facilities are available to run tests. In many places, the environment is not good for patients at all.The raids that have shut down numerous unregistered hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres frequently seem to be for show now – one day they are closed, and the next day they are up and running again. The health administration has consistently failed to stop the massive level of corruption and irregularities that go on in these healthcare facilities, as an overwhelming majority of owners of illegal hospitals are politically influential.Illegal and unlicensed hospitals are mainly broker-dependent. In other words, agents of these hospitals roam around in the government hospitals, which are overburdened and have limited resources, and lure patients and their families – especially those who come from rural areas to seek medical treatment – to these private practices. In these hospitals, patients are often subjected to maltreatment, and the expenses are also very high. Many patients and their families lose everything to pay for their medical bills. These brokers roam around openly and are known. Yet, no action is taken against them.Owners of illegal clinics and diagnostic centres are also quite well-connected – both financially and politically. Therefore, oftentimes, if a patient dies due to improper treatment in any of these clinics, not much is said and done about it. That is why the raids to identify and fine illegal practices do not bring any significant change in the country's healthcare system. Unless the core problems are addressed, they never will.Healthcare has turned into a lucrative business for many people in the country, who do not deviate from their mission to make profits even in the most extreme situations. We have all seen how some people made hundreds of thousands of taka just by selling masks and testing kits in the early days of Covid-19 pandemic, when there was a severe crisis. Measly budgetary allocations for the health sector have not helped the situation either. Lack of priority on the government's part to make healthcare accessible to everyone is leaving a major segment of our population vulnerable to these profiteers. The only way to save our health sector from them and make quality healthcare accessible and affordable for the general mass is to bring the entire healthcare system of the country under the public sector. Regulations have to be in place and implemented in order bring semblance of accountability to the healthcare sector. Conducting some raids against private hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres from time to time will not make much difference.Dr Rakib Al Hasan is a physician, author, activist, and youth leader.

/tech-startup/news/mars-very-likely-hosted-alien-life-the-past-study-suggests-3140771,"Mars 'very likely' hosted alien life in the past, study suggests","According to a recent study, ""methanogens""—a class of organisms—likely lived in underground lairs on Mars billions of years ago and may still do so today.The study offers a tantalising glimpse of how microbial aliens could have emerged and survived on the red planet and concludes that Mars was ""very likely"" habitable to life more than 3.7 billion years ago and may still be home to hardy organisms today.Mars, today, is cold and dry. But there is a wealth of evidence to suggest that this world was once warmer, wetter, and more hospitable to life. In order to look for signs of extinct aliens that may have lived there billions of years ago, NASA's Perseverance rover is currently exploring the dried-out remnants of what was once a vast ancient lakebed on Mars, known as Jezero Crater.A team of researchers led by Boris Sauterey, a biologist at the Institut de Biologie de l'École Normale Supérieure in France, has published a groundbreaking study that evaluates the possibility of hydrogen-eating methanogens on early Mars and makes predictions about the future survival of any hypothetical descendants of these organisms.Even though there is no proof that life has ever existed on Mars, scientists have theorised that methanogens, which are among the oldest life forms on Earth, may have thrived in the planet's early environments. Methanogens produce methane as a waste product and get their energy from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, both of which were present on ancient Mars.The researchers also found that the early Martian microbes' activities would have caused a global cooling effect, possibly resulting in their own extinction. For billions of years, life has also changed the climate here on Earth, but these feedback loops have generally preserved and even improved the habitability of our planet. According to the new study, transient life may develop on many planets, but the kind of long-term habitability we have on Earth might be an exception.",2022-10-12

Indicators to check the progress of Target 4.7 are the extent to which global citizenship education and education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment. So, we have an excellent target and related indicators to measure the progress.However, what is the reality in the mainstream model of education? Since the 1972 Stockholm environmental conference, promotion of environmental education began to be mainstreamed into educational curricula, led globally by Unesco. Then came Chapter 36 of the Agenda 21 on Education, adopted at the Earth Summit in 1992, and finally SDG 4. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports call for action in striking a balance between lowering energy and resource intensity and promoting decarbonisation. But they overlook and underestimate the role of education in climate change, linking it narrowly to behavioural change through education and community approaches, including local and Indigenous knowledge. It is unsurprising that hardly any educator participated in writing the IPCC reports.However, this oversight reveals a much deeper issue, which is a de facto endorsement of business-as-usual in education, as a solution to environmental change. The assumption is that a wider access to quality education would automatically translate into higher environmental awareness and behavioural change, and most international development efforts have consistently prioritised Western education models that focus on economic growth and social equity over environmental issues. So, the education-related works of the World Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Unesco explicitly promote human capital theory, to realise the infinite growth paradigm. While their official statements align with SDG 4, they are targeted for promoting economic growth, as if there is no conflict between continued growth and environmental sustainability. Such angelisation of GDP growth is short-sighted, at the expense of limited environmental resources. This is evident from serious ecological crises all over the world.But sustainable growth – the physical expansion of economies – is an oxymoron, because the former cannot continue ad infinitum in a bounded global ecological system. This oversight is the reason that education and research on SDG 4.7 (sustainable lifestyles and global citizenship) remains a neglected area. Unesco's Institute of Statistics has focused its efforts on developing metrics for SDG 4.1- 4.6, while leaving SDG 4.7 unaddressed; this omission is evident in the SDG 4 Data Book: Global Education Indicators 2018. Any discussion on SDG 4.7 is almost always linked to improvements in individual cognitive skills, suggesting that SDG 4 goals can be achieved under the current education paradigm.But research by environmental psychologists shows that higher cognitive skills and knowledge do not necessarily prompt citizens into environment-friendly action. Rather, culture, including the concept of self (independent or interdependent self), affects how people are guided towards action. Western countries with dominant ""independent"" selfhood have higher carbon dioxide emissions and ecological footprints than in cultures with ""interdependent"" selfhood. Looking at the increasing disconnect between climate science and climate policies at international and national levels, it is clear that the Earth does not need mere ""educated"" consumers of knowledge; rather, it needs more ""environmentally-educated"" consumers.This reality calls for a fundamental reconceptualisation of education itself, along the line of famous American ecologist Aldo Leopold, that we need not just higher ""volume"" of education, but a change in its ""content."" This will bring into sharp relief, together with knowledge and skills (curriculum), access and equity (structure), a more fundamental revaluation of self and others (our being), i.e. culture and our relationship with ""nature."" We must fundamentally change the way we think of economic growth as the road to sustainable development, because the latter does not always require growth for improving the quality of life. While many developing countries still need environment-friendly growth for development, developed countries must focus on qualitative development, as they have achieved enough quantitative growth through mass and junk productions. So, understanding interactions, particularly negative loops, among different SDGs and different dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental – is instrumental in rethinking whether and under what conditions education can contribute to limiting climate change. This calls for a scathing critique of independent self-based Western model of education, with predominant focus on imparting knowledge and skills in numeracy. Do these skills fostering reflection over our ""being"" among students result in wisdom and self-realisation? Perhaps not.In the end, let me recall the wisdom of Spanish philosopher Ortega Gasset, who criticised the modern trend in university education of micro and macro specialisations, which create ""learned ignorants"" who lose sight of the forest for the trees and leaves. We must maintain a balance between breadth and depth in disciplines across university departments. At a minimum, we must set a goal of ecological literacy for all our students at the tertiary level. No student should graduate from universities without a comprehension of the basic principles of ecology and ecological economics, carrying capacity, energetics, end-use analysis, how to live a good life, limits of technology, appropriate scale, sustainable agriculture and forestry, steady-state economics, and environmental ethics. As Leopold very cogently asked, ""If education does not teach us these things, then what is education for?""Dr Mizan R Khan is deputy director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), and technical lead at the LDC Universities' Consortium on Climate Change (LUCCC).",2022-10-12

She is being held in solitary confinement in the capital, Naypyitaw, and her trials have been conducted in closed courts.The latest charges were related to allegations Suu Kyi accepted bribes from a businessman, said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.Suu Kyi received three-year jail sentences on two charges, to be served concurrently.Opponents of the military say the charges against Suu Kyi are aimed at blocking her from ever getting involved in politics again or trying to challenge the military's grip on power since last year's coup.A junta spokesperson did not answer calls seeking comment on Wednesday.

Only two of those six will make it into the semi-finals.If that was not enough, off the field Afghanistan's cricket board is facing a financial crisis because funds from the International Cricket Council are not reaching the country due to sanctions on the Taliban government.The Afghans were touted as dark-horses at the recent Asia Cup, but in the Super Four stage they lost to eventual champions Sri Lanka and also Pakistan and India.Skipper Nabi nevertheless took some positives.""As a unit, as a team, we showed in the Asia Cup that Afghanistan has quality batsmen, bowlers and fielders,"" Nabi said at the time.""We are known to defend totals, not chase totals. Our team looks properly balanced.""Afghanistan's biggest strength is their globe-trotting spin quartet of Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Qais Ahmad.They have featured in various Twenty20 leagues around the world and have ample experience of Australian pitches while playing in the Big Bash League. They know how to stop runs and take wickets in Australia.Former New Zealand coach Mike Hesson fears Afghanistan's spinners could cause havoc against the 2021 beaten finalists.""I'm a little bit wary of New Zealand playing Afghanistan at Melbourne,"" said Hesson.""Because the Melbourne pitch does take turn and the Afghanistan spinners are as good as there are throughout the world. That's going to be a tough game for the Black Caps.""Besides the spin attack, Afghanistan now also have quality left-arm pacers in Fazalhaq Farooqi and Fareed Ahmad.True to their aggressive nature, Afghanistan's batting is full of hard hitters.The opening duo of Hazratullah Zazai and Rahmanullah Gurbaz can hit over the top at will. The middle order is packed with Najibullah Zadran, all-rounder Nabi, Ibrahim Zadran and newcomer Darwish Rasooli.Recently joined head coach Jonathan Trott, the former England batsman, has brought a degree of sanity to the cavalier batting style by directing one batter to hold one end while others hit around him.

/news/world/uk/news/uk-pm-truss-fires-kwasi-kwarteng-says-bbc-3142741,"UK PM Truss fires Kwasi Kwarteng, says BBC","British Prime Minister Liz Truss has fired her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, the BBC reported on Friday, shortly before she is expected to scrap parts of his economic package in a bid to survive the market and political turmoil gripping the country.Downing Street confirmed that Truss, in power for only 37 days, would hold a press conference later on Friday after Kwarteng was forced to rush back to London from IMF meetings in Washington to address the chaos.The BBC said Kwarteng had been sacked. Downing Street declined to comment.If that is confirmed, Kwarteng would become Britain's shortest serving chancellor since 1970, and his successor would be the country's fourth finance minister in as many months.British government bonds rallied further on Friday, adding to their partial recovery since Truss's government started looking for ways to balance the books after her unfunded tax cuts crushed UK asset values and drew international censure.Kwarteng had announced a new fiscal policy on Sept. 23, delivering Truss's vision for vast tax cuts and deregulation to try to shock the economy out of years of stagnant growth.But the response from markets was so ferocious that the Bank of England had to intervene to prevent pension funds from being caught up in the chaos, as borrowing and mortgage costs surged.The duo have since been under mounting pressure to reverse course, as polls showed support for their Conservative Party had collapsed, prompting colleagues to openly discuss whether they should be replaced.Having triggered a market rout, Truss now runs the risk of bringing the government down if she cannot find a package of public spending cuts and tax rises that can appease investors and get through any parliamentary vote in the House of Commons.Her search for savings will be made harder by the fact the government has been cutting departmental budgets for years.At the same time the Conservative Party's discipline has all but broken down, fractured by infighting as it struggled first to agree a way to leave the European Union and then how to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and grow the economy.""If you can't get your budget through parliament you can't govern,"" Chris Bryant, a senior lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter. ""This isn't about u-turns, it's about proper governance.""Downing Street has so far declined to comment but Kwarteng had not been expected to appear at Truss's news conference later on Friday, fuelling speculation about his future.During his time in the United States Kwarteng had been told by the head of the International Monetary Fund of the importance of ""policy coherence"", underlining how far Britain's reputation for sound economic management and institutional stability had fallen.Shortly before 11 a.m. (10:00 GMT) Britain's television news channels switched to carry live footage of a British Airways plane landing at Heathrow, carrying Kwarteng.In Westminster, Truss was trying to find agreement with her cabinet ministers on a way to preserve her push for growth while also reassuring the markets and working out which of the measures could be supported by her lawmakers in parliament.Earlier a minister in the trade department, Greg Hands, had said people wanting details on the budget would have to wait until Oct. 31 when Kwarteng was due to set out his full plan alongside independent forecasts that will show the cost of the tax cuts to the public finances and whether they will boost economic growth.Critics of the government had said that wait was unacceptable.Rupert Harrison, a portfolio manager at Blackrock and once an adviser to former British finance minister George Osborne, said markets have now almost fully priced in a U-turn.""(That) means if the U-turn doesn't come markets will react badly,"" he said on Twitter.INTERNATIONAL CREDIBILITYA Conservative Party lawmaker, who asked not to be named, said Truss's economic policy had caused so much damage that investors may demand even deeper cuts to public spending as the price for their support.""Everything's possible at the moment,"" said the lawmaker, who backed Sunak in the leadership race. ""Problem is the markets have lost trust in the Conservative Party - and who can blame them?""Another lawmaker told Reuters earlier this week that Truss needed to appreciate that there was not a huge amount of enthusiasm for her at the moment.According to a source close to the prime minister, Truss is now in ""listening mode"" and inviting lawmakers to speak to her team about their concerns to gauge which parts of the programme they would support in parliament.Credit Suisse economist Sonali Punhani said markets needed to see a credible fiscal plan, with the government needing to find around 60 billion pounds through tax cut U-turns and further spending cuts.""It would be challenging to deliver the scale of these cuts, but for them to be credible, these need to be delivered sooner rather than in the latter part of the forecast,"" Punhani said.One policy that is expected to be reversed is their plan to hold corporation tax rates at 19%. That had formed a key part of their package after Sunak proposed increasing it to 25% when he was finance minister under Truss's predecessor Boris Johnson.",2022-10-14

But we also know there are no guarantees. We have to win two games.""Divan la Cock, dubbed ""an exciting talent"" by De Bruyn, is likely to open the batting in place of the retired Craig Williams but apart from that the Eagles will be relying on the core of the 2021 team.Veteran Wiese and JJ Smit are hard-hitting batsmen and Namibia have an unusual bowling attack, dominated by left-arm seamers.They are mentored by bowling coach Albie Morkel who has been able to call on help from his brother, the former South Africa Test fast bowler Morne Morkel.""Morne lives in Australia now and he's bowled many overs here. He brings calmness and some good ideas,"" said De Bruyn.Albie Morkel joined up with the Eagles when they defeated Zimbabwe 3-2 in a five-match T20 series in May. Namibia have only played three other T20 internationals this year.But a link-up with Pakistan T20 Super League champions Lahore Qalandars has seen four Namibian players train at the Qalandars academy while a Twenty20 tri-series, including South Africa's Lions, formed part of their World Cup preparations.""We would like to have played more internationals but we have played quite a lot of T20 cricket (in the tri-series) against teams like the Lions and Lahore Qalandars,"" said De Bruyn.Namibia's Super 12 highlight in the UAE a year ago came against Scotland, when Trumpelmann became the first bowler to take three wickets in the first over of an T20 international to set up a four-wicket win.They found life tougher in their other five matches but gained valuable experience.Reaching the Super 12 was enough to secure their berth in Australia this year.

/shout/news/everything-you-need-know-watching-one-piece-film-red-3142826,Everything you need to know before watching One Piece Film: Red,"Over the past 25 years, One Piece has accumulated a large and illustrious catalogue of non-canon and spin-off movies. As it currently stands, there are a total of 15 feature films in the franchise, each having varying degrees of importance to the main story. And the latest addition to the franchise, One Piece Film: Red, hit Bangladeshi theatres on October 14.Released in Japan in August 2022, One Piece Film: Red follows the Straw Hat Pirates as they venture into the world's grandest concert. At the helm of the festivities will be Princess Uta, who is apparently the daughter of Red-haired Shanks, one of the most mysterious characters in the series.While the announcement of the film's release in Bangladesh garnered widespread popularity, most fans still have their own reservations about the upcoming film. Owing to the sheer volume of inconsequential and lacklustre One Piece movies in the past, a large number of people are worried about the events surrounding the movie and what they can expect out of it.Firstly, to address the elephant in the room, One Piece Film: Red isn't canon. To be more specific, the events that transpire in the movie are wholly independent of the continuity of the main story. However, the film will likely explore elements and shed light on information relevant to the current plot.According to One Piece author Eiichiro Oda, Film: Red will reveal canonical information about Shanks, despite his character getting little to no development in the actual series. The film is supposed to shed light on his past, which will directly connect to the manga's ongoing story. Furthermore, the film's trailers suggested a childhood friendship between the primary protagonist, Luffy and Uta, which might prove to be important to the main storyline moving forward.Another important matter that must be touched upon is the extent of prior knowledge that is required to properly enjoy the movie. Unfortunately, this is where things start to get trickier. Film: Red's cast of characters includes both protagonist and antagonist forces from some of the most recent arcs like the Whole Cake Island arc. Moreover, there are also certain abilities and revelations in the film that haven't even been adapted into the anime yet. As such, the film will definitely navigate through spoiler territory for those who aren't fully caught up to the source material yet.And unlike other films like Jujutsu Kaisen 0, which could be viewed without prior knowledge regarding their respective franchises, One Piece Film: Red does require some amount of knowledge regarding the vast world of fictional pirates. As a result, casual fans who haven't watched One Piece before may not be able to fully indulge in everything the film has to offer.Regardless, the film has earned over 15 billion yen locally, making it one of Japan's highest-grossing films ever. Fans and critics alike have praised the show for its lush animation, an abundance of soundtracks, and top-tier fight scenes, making it a must-watch for One Piece fans.Reference:Sportskeeda (July 18, 2022). Oda confirms One Piece Film: Red will uncover Shanks' secret that has a canon connection.Ayaan spends most of his time formatting spreadsheets.

/business/economy/news/the-death-traditional-telecomsis-it-imminent-3142476,The death of traditional telecoms: Is it imminent?,"Don't panic! Telecoms are not going anywhere! But technology will certainly be hugely disrupted with the advent of high bandwidth and low-latency satellite internet.  Elon Musk has pioneered the disruption by launching Starlink, which puts traditional telecom companies under an imminent threat. Tower and fibre companies would, therefore, need to have their own survival strategy.Recently, one of the potential competitors of Starlink studied the Bangladesh market to figure out if it is feasible for them to provide low-cost high bandwidth and low-latency internet access from 2025. The same company has a plan to launch more than 12,000 low orbit satellites in the next few years. And they found it feasible to provide back-haul support to mobile network operators (MNOs).Let's understand the traditional telecom versus satellite infrastructure.The traditional infrastructure transmits and receives signals using land-based towers. Again, the towers are connected through fibre. Each tower covers its own boundary. The reason for problems like weak signals, call drops, low data speed etc, is the absence of towers in close proximity.On the other hand, satellite infrastructure is not dependent on terrestrial systems but utilises satellites orbiting the earth. This allows satellite signals to cover a much wider area.Imagine a future where an effective satellite will be deployed at a substantially lower cost than what it is today, and a 25GB 5G data plan being sold at $10 per month. The price may look to be a stretch but given the continued trend of rapid innovation and economic rationale, the capex (capital expenditure) cost per user per GB will be lower for satellite infrastructure as against the traditional telecom infrastructure.It must be borne in mind that a satellite can reach way more people than a tower, breaking various natural barriers.Is the traditional telecom infrastructure cheaper or less capex-hungry?If one considers the costs involved in building, updating and maintaining towers and fibres, active equipment investment, investment for rapid change in technology and high taxation, it makes it prohibitively expensive from both capex and opex (operating expense) perspective.However, there are debates over the number of satellites that can fit in LEO. Musk argues that tens of billions of satellites can coexist in LEO as against the current number of 4,500.Some 37 per cent of the world's population is not connected to internet. According to Iridum, a satellite communication company, only 15 per cent of the world's surface is covered by a traditional cellular network.In the case of Bangladesh, more than 60 per cent of the population is not connected to internet.For those living in rural or remote areas, advancement in satellite technology can complement existing terrestrial infrastructure in order to bring these individuals online and remove the digital divide.The government of Bangladesh and the private sector should explore the possibility of using LEO satellites to address the current accessibility issue of the rural and poor population as the best option available instead of relying on MNOs.The author is a telecom and management expert.",2022-10-14

From making Warner Bros Discovery less-diverse overall—by cutting a large number of employees—his latest plans to restructure the company seems likely to kill a channel most of us have grown up with, Cartoon Network. Even if Cartoon Network is not completely killed off, it is likely to become a shadow of what it originally used to be.These recent cuts, which come in the wake of Warner's merger with Discovery, eliminated a total of 43 open positions from its television division. In August, Warner Bros Discovery also cut around 70 positions at HBO Max, which also killed off the completed ""Batgirl"" movie and also resulted in dozens of other shows and movies being shelved.Now, people are concerned about the implications of the company's latest plans to merge Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios.According to an internal memo from Warner Bros Television CEO, Channing Dungey, Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe, Warner Bros Animation, and Cartoon Network Studios would continue to exist, under a 'new streamlined structure'.However, Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios will now have to share their development and production team. This decision probably  But the latter two animation labels will now share ""development and main production teams,"" which essentially means that Cartoon Network Studios will no longer have the creative control, as well as the choice to make decisions regarding operational matters.Zaslav's crusade to cut costs by cancelling the ""Batgirl"" movie—which has already completed filming—and shows like ""Raised by Wolves"", is seemingly continuing with the current situation surrounding Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios.However, as these two studios will now be working under one shared budget and a singular team, it seems unlikely that they will be able to operate in the same capacity they had previously. If this was not obvious already, earlier this month, Cartoon Network's ""Craig of the Creek"" and ""Jessica's Big Little World"" had their episode orders cut back by 50 percent. While both shows have not been cancelled as of yet, the way their budgets have been cut—despite the fact that they are some of Cartoon Network's most successful franchises—feels like a tell-tale situation for things to come. It seems likely that Warner Bros Discovery will keep the brand of Cartoon Network alive, simply due to the level of fanfare surrounding it.

At this time, another traffic police officer ran away, witnesses said.Mizanur's face was bruised in the attack. He was later taken to a local hospital by two passersby. He got 13 stitches on his face.Following the incident, the rickshaw pullers left the scene.After that, they unitedly attacked a few traffic police boxes including Mirpur 12, Kalshi and Sagufta areas. A police motorbike was also vandalised during the incident. The rickshaw pullers alleged that they have been facing various harassment including cases and bribes by the policemen.The AC said police have been carrying out regular raids to enforce a High Court order banning battery-powered rickshaws from operating on the main roads. The drivers of such vehicles have continued to defy the ban, leading to various accidents, he added.""When we were conducting an operation against these illegal rickshaws, the drivers unitedly attacked the traffic police boxes with bricks and sticks.

/shout/news/the-epic-battle-between-my-appetite-and-food-videos-3142896,The epic battle between my appetite and food videos,"I believe my habit of watching food videos developed out of my desperate attempt to include leisure time in my very hectic schedule. Food videos are short enough for me to finish watching them, but also uninteresting enough for me to stop watching as required. The only problem being, they leave me hungry. Often at inconvenient times.That being said, as of 2:15 AM right now, I have decided to log how long I can watch only food videos, without ordering/cooking any food outside my regular diet. To make things embarrassing, when I say log, I mean write an article about my pathetic attempt. Day 1– I am more than my appetiteWhile watching these videos, I initially focus on other aspects of the videos. For example, how clean the kitchen in the video is, to distract myself from the actual food. I even went as far as to be inspired to clean my own room in the middle of the night. My mother was very pleased by how clean my room was in the morning. She even made me fried chicken when I got home from work that day as a thank you. Did the chicken help appease my innate need for ordering food? Not really. Did I try imagining the chicken to be the food I was craving? None of your business.Day 2 – Going through my financesMiraculously, despite the food videos being similar, I was still not bored. Instead, my appetite increased. So, being the responsible adult that I am, I decided to prove to myself that I was already over-budget this month, and therefore could not order food. Going through my finances, I realised I have fifteen taka to my name. Because now this would mean I must go scour the internet to see if I can buy anything for fifteen taka.Day 3 – Forgetting about the videos entirelyMy quest to find food worth ten taka has almost taken up half my day (I decided to save five taka for later). Having accepted defeat, I had finally given up and bought one packet of chips from the nearest shop. I then suddenly remembered what the main purpose of this quest was, and went straight back to food videos on Youtube.Day 4 – Attempting to cookWho needs to order food when you can instead just make it yourself? After going through thousands of Youtube videos, getting all my cooking utensils and ingredients ready, I then proceeded to go request my sister to cook for me, because all I wanted was easy food without any effort having to be put in on my end, only to be rejected. Why must things be so complicated?Day 5 – Convincing myself I don't need itDifferent cuisines fit different palettes. What if the food I'm seeing is not compatible with my palettes? I would be wasting my hard-earned money. It would be much wiser to instead stick to the flavours I am familiar with, and, who am I kidding?Day 6 – OrderingI have zero regrets. One hundred percent worth it. But I am never repeating it again because I am once again over budget in terms of spending, and I now owe money to a loan shark. Maybe I should adopt a life of crime. That is the sort of profession that could actually fund this lifestyle.Bushra Zaman likes books, art, and only being contacted by email. Contact her at bushrazaman31@yahoo.com",2022-10-14

/opinion/views/news/ask-your-party-commit-rti-3142746,Ask your party to commit to RTI,"Bangladesh is in the throes of election fever, even though the next general elections are more than a year away. There is fear that the situation may become more tense and heated than the previous two elections. One way to cool down and professionalise the atmosphere would be to make the elections more issue-based. They should be contests in which political parties explain their respective positions on critical national issues to the voting public. One such issue is governance and the commitment of those seeking to govern the country. Two laws form the basis for citizens to affect governance. First, the election laws which allow citizens once every five years to elect people to power, whom they trust to ensure better governance. Secondly, the Right to Information (RTI) Act, which empowers citizens to monitor the work of all public offices entrusted with day-to-day governance and ensure that they do so lawfully. We believe both are equally important. The RTI law complements election laws by providing a more permanent basis for citizens to intervene with the government on matters of governance. The forthcoming elections provide an opportunity to emphasise this aspect of RTI. To begin with, RTI enthusiasts and citizen groups should demand that political parties declare their position on the subject. The goal should be to engage the political parties in discussions regarding the revolutionary objectives of the law and the role they must play – should they form the next government. Are they committed to help the law reach its full potential without any hindrance? Will they ensure that public officials will respect the law and not restrict its application or abuse its provisions to frustrate its objectives?The elections provide us an opportunity to look back over the years since the RTI Act was enacted in 2009, identify issues that slow progress and the measures required to correct them. This is a young law: 13 years is not a very long time for a law of such a nature to strike deep roots anywhere in the world. This law's objectives go against the grain of traditional governance practices employed globally. But societies must move towards openness; unless we pay attention to the challenges and learn to overcome them, progress will prove elusive. Among all laws of the land, RTI is uniquely a people's law and only people can make it work. Governments have little or no incentive to do so since the ideal of the law is to bring them under people's control. There is a need to continually educate the public about the objectives of the law and help them articulate their demands to the political parties to commit themselves to its implementation. The prevailing culture of governance in most countries is to foster secrecy as opposed to transparency. The general assumption is that ordinary citizens not only have no business in the affairs of the state, but those wanting to enquire into them must have illegitimate motives. In fact, this has been the experience of many in Bangladesh, leading them to abandon their RTI pursuits. Political parties must be asked to clearly state their positions to the public in this regard. When Bangladesh adopted the law, the topic was not fully debated. The elections offer an opportunity to air out these concerns and objectives in public discourse. As in many other countries, the RTI experience in Bangladesh has revealed many procedural difficulties citizens face to obtain information from public authorities. Many public officials use the law and its procedures to avoid responsibilities and to discourage and deny information requests from citizens. They fail to recognise that the law encourages citizens to seek information from public offices not for personal needs only, but also to advance public good. Let's ask those seeking to form the next government to do their best to remove all impediments to the application of the RTI law and encourage public officials to respect its objectives. This should include keeping to the timelines foreseen in the law and not denying information requests without explanation.Those standing for elections should also tell us whether they would be ready to provide the necessary support to the Information Commission, which is entrusted with the job of steering the law and resolving disputes between seekers and providers of information. Of particular importance would be to increase their capacity not only to take proper decisions, but also to articulate them judiciously to help the development of proper jurisprudence on the subject. Let's ask those we are voting for if they will commit to following the selection process for commissioners, and ensure that they have legal expertise and act with objectivity and neutrality. Let's also remind election candidates that successfully implementing RTI is an essential element of Goal 16 of the SDGs, to which Bangladesh has committed itself fully. So far, there is little to show that we are doing well in that regard. Finally, political parties must bear in mind that their commitment to better governance and a more effective RTI regime in the country would depend a great deal upon their ability to ensure rule of law, accountability, civil liberties, and political rights for the citizens. Let the next general elections focus more on these issues and help the nation tread the democratic path more confidently.Dr Shamsul Bari and Ruhi Naz are chairman and assistant director (RTI), respectively, at Research Initiatives, Bangladesh (RIB).",2022-10-14
/opinion/views/blowin-the-wind/news/university-ranking-announcement-and-the-morning-after-3142761,University ranking announcement and the morning after,"The oldest private university in Bangladesh is giving its oldest public university a run for its money. They are the only two educational institutions to be featured in the top 800 of a world ranking estimated by Times Higher Education (THE). To see these local universities in the same global category provokes more questions than answers. These two universities – one in Dhaka North, the other in Dhaka South – are separated by thick traffic worth two-three hours on the road and a culture of mutual dismissiveness. Whether the ranking agency will thaw the frozen relationship is a matter to be seen. The achievement of North South University (NSU) cannot be brushed aside as it devised and pursued a strategic plan to achieve its status in the elite club of universities. Three other Bangladeshi universities, all technical in orientation – Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), and Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (Kuet) – have been featured in the 1200-1500 range. The overall performance is dismal. It begs the question: why are the other leading public universities and notable private universities not there?Established in 1921, Dhaka University (DU) has a clear advantage in the five areas in which THE measures the performance of a university: teaching, research, citations, international outlook, and industry income. With its government funding, DU caters to 38,172 students and has a fleet of 2,200 teachers. Conversely, NSU, established in 1992, has 20,596 students with a teaching team of 386 full-time and 362 part-time teachers. As per the UGC's 2019 record, DU spent Tk 52.02 crore in research and had 472 publications, while NSU spent Tk 65.32 crore in research and claimed 1,135 publications.It needs to be mentioned that a university needs to have 300 indexed publications a year for five consecutive years to be considered for THE ranking. NSU has persistently nurtured a research culture to be at par with a university that is 70 years older than it. The presence of three technical universities in the ranking suggests that they have the required number of publications, which many other universities lack.It is refreshing to see that DU is feeling the pressure to excel. Recently, it initiated an annual performance goal for each academic department and liberalised its international outlook. According to THE, 7.5 percent marks are given for international outlook based on the proportion of international students, international staff and international collaboration. This is an area in which private universities have greater flexibility. In terms of teaching, which makes up for 30 percent of the ranking scale, the subcategories are reputation survey, staff-to-student ratio, doctorate to bachelors ratio, doctorate awarded to academic staff, and institutional income.Given the government's policy of not allowing private universities to award doctorate degrees, private universities are missing out on the learning environment category. The same goes for industry income, amounting to 2.5 percent of THE ranking metrics, in which private universities are handicapped as they are not allowed to run for-profit institutes. But a lot depends on the reputation survey (15 percent in teaching and 18 percent in research), where the alumni in the job market contribute to the overall image of the participating university.NSU's success will inspire some other private universities to join the world ranking. They already have a clear strategic vision in place. The share of student distribution in the tertiary system, if we exclude the colleges under the National University, is almost equal. However, there persist some misconceptions about private universities as they are subjected to some additional regulatory monitoring that handicaps their growth.The introduction of private universities has stopped many students from going abroad as they could get quality education within the country and save money because of the credit-transfer scheme. In many cases, the curricula of public universities are not updated. Most of our programmes are not accredited. The government has initiated the Bangladesh Accreditation Council, which is likely to address the issue and bring the public and private universities under the same measurement scale. For the tertiary sector to grow, there has to be a common and consistent policy. Some older universities behave as if they are above any scrutiny. Their claim to vaunted prestige is now being rightfully challenged and claimed by newer universities. It is about time these divisions were eschewed as the teachers who teach and the students who learn are all citizens of this country. They all deserve fair and equal treatment. For instance, UGC research and travel grants are given only to public university teachers. UGC allows PhD programmes to be offered only by public universities.With the kind of intellectual resources that the leading private universities have, either through reverse brain drain by accommodating returning expatriate scholars or through retaining the best teachers who have retired from the public system, they can easily attract both local and international students in PhD programmes. Of course, UGC can apply strict regulatory criteria for awarding the degree. In absence of such open-mindedness, we are seeing many of our local students going abroad. Malaysia has become the second largest student destination for Bangladeshi students, which used to be a source country in the 1980s. According to the Bangladesh Bank, in the first four months of this year, USD 343.9 million were sent abroad to Bangladeshi students. Through the official channel, USD 1.32 billion (Tk 12,144 crore) was sent abroad for outbound student mobility. The actual figures would be higher as there is no record of the illegal channels. The number of outbound students has increased by 129 percent in the last six years. The success of DU and NSU shows that with the right attitude, we can create world-class universities to cater to our local needs and retain foreign currencies from being siphoned out. But to benefit from the system, we need a radical change in the mindset of the policymakers and the government. Dr Shamsad Mortuza is a professor of English at Dhaka University.",2022-10-14

/sports/football/news/psg-troubled-mbappe-future-the-air-again-3142811,PSG troubled as Mbappe future up in the air again,"Less than five months after Kylian Mbappe signed a new three-year contract to supposedly end the uncertainty about his future, Paris Saint-Germain are once again facing up to the possibility of losing the France superstar.The Qatar-owned club sit top of Ligue 1 and their Champions League group, but all is not well in the French capital with a raft of reasons given for Mbappe reportedly wanting away.It has completely overshadowed PSG's build-up to Sunday's game against bitter rivals Marseille.The speculation started on Tuesday, hours before Christophe Galtier's team hosted Benfica in the Champions League, with Spanish sports daily Marca and several French media reporting that Mbappe wants to leave as early as the January transfer window.Mbappe has in recent weeks let it be known publicly that he is unhappy with the position he has been asked to play in new coach Galtier's system, pointing out after playing for France last month that he has ""much more freedom"" playing for his country.Mbappe still scored his 12th goal of the season for PSG as they drew 1-1 with Benfica, but it is believed he is disappointed the club did not sign a top-class centre-forward in the close season –- for example Robert Lewandowski, who went to Barcelona.PSG's football advisor Luis Campos told Canal Plus that Mbappe had ""never spoken to me about leaving in January"".However, that was before the investigative website Mediapart reported on Wednesday that an agency called Digital Big Brother (DBB) had worked on behalf of PSG to deploy a series of Twitter accounts with the task of boosting the club's image.The work involved going after a number of targets earmarked by the club, including a supporter slapped by Neymar after PSG lost the 2019 French Cup final and a woman who accused the Brazilian of raping her.But there were also internal targets, such as Adrien Rabiot –- now with Juventus –- and Mbappe himself.""We worked for PSG. It bothers us for our reputation that PSG deny working with us,"" Frederic Geldhof, who worked for a subsidiary of DBB called UReputation, told AFP.PSG have ""firmly"" denied the allegations that they asked the agency to work on their behalf.""We were doing everything to get him to extend his contract. We were not going to secretly troll him,"" one source, formerly connected to the PSG board, told AFP of the claims Mbappe was targeted.The affair carries similarities to the 'Barcagate' scandal which saw Barcelona allegedly hire a company to smear opponents of the club's board on social media.It may do little to help the relationship between PSG and their biggest star, even if there is surely little prospect of the club agreeing to sell Mbappe in the January transfer window.One to watch: Laurent Blanc

/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/how-build-capsule-wardrobe-3143396,How to build a capsule wardrobe,"If you have been following the fashion influencer or the lifestyle influencer scene on the Internet in the past few years, you must have come across the term ""capsule wardrobe"". Below, we describe everything there is to know about capsule wardrobes for both men and women, including the steps to developing a capsule wardrobe and items to purchase. A capsule wardrobe is simply a collection of clothing composed of thoughtfully curated, easily interchangeable items designed to maximise the number of outfits that you can create. These pieces will create a strong foundation for your entire collection. These are minimal, comfortable, classic, and timeless pieces that will go with everything else you own and can be worn again and again. The items will be carefully and intentionally selected to provide purpose to your lifestyle. I'm sure you have experienced the ""I have nothing to wear despite my closet overflowing"" phenomenon at least once in your life. Often, we end up purchasing random pieces that just collect dust in our closets as it becomes difficult to integrate those into our everyday lives. Having a capsule wardrobe saves us from this decision fatigue. Decision fatigue is the weary feeling you get after being faced with too many decisions, affecting your decision-making choices, and the quality of the process. Having a curated wardrobe makes it easier to pick outfits for any occasion, saving time shopping, deciding what to wear, and reducing stress. It also allows you to discover and develop your personal style. A capsule wardrobe is also very sustainable and wallet-friendly. As you purchase high-quality items, that serve a purpose to your style and life, you end up wearing and re-wearing every piece, with nothing going to waste. Buying fewer items allows you to save up money for the more important things in life. It also reduces your carbon footprint. Before you start building a capsule wardrobe, keep in mind that it is a fairly slow process and takes about 2-3 years to build and perfect. You are not expected to build the wardrobe overnight. Do not be too stressed about it, it is an exercise to help you be more conscious, not a punishment. You should have a capsule wardrobe for each of the seasons. If you reside in Dhaka, having two capsule wardrobes – one for summer and one for winter will work just fine. Assess everything in your wardrobe. Try them on, see if they fit you, if you like them and if they flatter you. Ask yourself when is the last time you wore this item. The goal is to analyse and find out what you gravitate towards and what you never touch. Set aside clothes that do not fit you anymore, that do not work for you anymore, and that you do not need. Get rid of clothes that are stained, damaged, and worn out beyond repair. Divide your finding into the three following parts: if a piece works for you but not for this season – place it in storage. If the piece does not work for you – sell or give it away. Pieces that work for you but you have not worn them out as much – give them a 3-month trial period. If you own multiple items which are similar in nature, keep one and remove the others. Another way to find out what you wear regularly, turn all your coat hangers to face the same way, then every time you wear something, turn it around. By the end of the month, you will have a good sense of the wardrobe heroes that you cannot live without as these are the pieces you should be basing your capsule around. Make sure to donate your decluttered or sell them second-hand, to ensure that the clothes reach those who need them, getting a second life.  It is time to chalk out a plan for your wardrobe. First, decide on the number of clothing you would like to own. While people decide on various numbers ranging from 26-37, you do not have to stick to such numbers. Just make sure you do not go overboard with your shopping for the capsule. Create an ideal shopping list, and compare it with your closet to find gaps. Your wish list should be consistent with your personal taste, style, how you spend most of your time and lifestyle. When you go to purchase something, make a mental note of what you are going to wear it with. This will help you build outfits instead of having pretty individual pieces. Remember, you are dressing for your actual life, not for some moments. Think about your goals, values, and intention behind the pieces. Always invest in quality pieces that will last years and fix your budget accordingly. This is by no means an exhaustive list and you can modify it depending on your needs. Your capsule is also not the ""end all, be all"". You can elevate it over the years and tap into the trends. Avoid buying into fads that will be out of fashion in a short time. Invest in trends that will last a few seasons. In order to take it slow, just plan in detail for the upcoming season, then edit and transition between each season. Choose pieces that are both functional and versatile. consider how easily it can be mixed and matched with other pieces, colours, and patterns, and whether you can wear it to different events or in different seasons.A neutral colour palette that includes black, white, grey, navy, beige, and cream is very versatile, allowing you to wear more colours with intention and weave different clothing genres together to create seamless looks. One way of incorporating colours is to select 2-3 accent colours per season to include in your seasonal capsule. Solid colours, which are not too muted or bright can be very versatile. Play around with textures, fabrics, and sizes too. Experimenting with different cuts, silhouettes, and sleeve styles adds a unique flair to your outfits. There is room to add prints to your wardrobe. Choose from classic prints like stripes, navy stripes, houndstooth, polka dots, and some iterations of plaids and checks. Just because Miranda Priestly from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was not impressed with florals for spring, does not mean you cannot have florals for spring and summer. Floral prints, whether big or small are always amazing for the summer and spring in blouses, dresses, and Kurtis. Do not view a capsule wardrobe as something restrictive. It is in fact quite the opposite. While the capsule wardrobe is meant to serve you for years to come, you can definitely edit and elevate it as you go. Just do not go down the rabbit hole of mindless shopping when adding things to your closet. Happy shopping! ",2022-10-15

/news/bangladesh/news/park-coffee-cart-or-biryani-shop-3143006,"Park, coffee cart or biryani shop?","In Old Dhaka's Bangshal stands a park in the shape of a triangle. It used to provide citizens with an avenue to go on morning and evening walks, or spend their leisure surrounded by greenery.This park, which dates back to the pre-independence era, had a library, 10 to 12 benches to sit on, and a small field, where children used to play.But due to sheer apathy of the authorities concerned, this park soon lost its glamour.The size of the park gradually shrank, as land grabbing went on unabated, while the remaining parts were too dilapidated to visit.To salvage whatever was left of the park, the first elected mayor of Dhaka, Mohammad Hanif renovated it, and installed a water fountain and two dove sculptures, as a symbol of peace.To carry on his father's legacy, former Dhaka south mayor Sayeed Khokon renovated the park and inaugurated it for the public in 2020.New walkways,  fresh grass, extended seating arrangements and lights were installed at the place under this project, and the water fountain was made functional.Soon after, the park was leased out to Bangshal Thana Bangabandhu Parishad president Haji Ahsan Ullah. Under the lease agreement,  Ahsan and company were supposed to run a coffee shop, on condition of selling coffee in a wheeled cart alongside taking care of the park.Building any permanent structure to sell anything other than coffee wasn't permitted under this arrangement.But in a recent visit to the Bangshal Park, this correspondent saw that a permanent steel structure has been built there, occupying at least one-third of the place. There are lines of chairs and tables centring it, but rather than coffee, what's being served is biryani.Even the water fountain has been shut down to facilitate the biryani shop. There are a few washing basins, a deep freezer, and rows of plastic chairs and tables inside Haji Ebadullah Biryani House, owned by one Liton Baburchi.Biryani is also served at benches on all three sides of the park.Contacted, Liton Baburchi said he has rented the place from Ahsan Ullah.Locals said they cannot walk or sit in peace at the park anymore, as the place is always abuzz with the biryani shop's customers. Besides, the size of the already small park has reduced significantly because of the makeshift-restaurant, they added.Abdul Hai, a resident of Mokimbazar, Bangshal, said this park used to be bigger.""There was a library here. People came here to read books, walk and play. But the park gradually died.""""When the park was renovated in 2020, or whatever was left of it, the locals thought they would finally get a place to pass peaceful leisure. But the biryani shop has threatened the park's serenity,"" he added.The park's lessee, Haji Ahsan Ullah, said they run the shop ""legally"".He said, ""We run a biryani shop next to the coffee shop. The DSCC officers come for regular inspections. There are no issues.""Local (Ward-35) Councillor Abu Saeed said, ""The park was made for walking, but now it's a business place. People cannot sit and walk. I've made a verbal complaint about this to the city corporation. I'll send a written complaint soon.""DSCC Chief Property Officer Russell Sabrin said there's no scope to run a biryani place after taking permission for a coffee cart.""We will cancel our agreement if the conditions of the lease are being violated,"" he added.",2022-10-15
/news/bangladesh/agriculture/news/farmers-kick-start-freshwater-machine-3142976,Farmers kick-start a freshwater machine,"Water is everywhere in and around Bangladesh, yet the lack of freshwater is one of its most pressing concerns.On the surface of this largest river delta on the planet, the abundance of water is facing serious threats of pollution, river encroachment, flooding, and diversion or obstruction of common river waters by India and China. And beneath the surface, there develops a big hollow due to the overdraw of groundwater for irrigation and industrialisation.The scarcity of surface water, especially in the dry season, is gradually pushing Bangladesh to depend heavily on groundwater for supply to households, farms, and industries. While the water outlook for one of the most fertile soils in the world is getting grimmer, a highly-acclaimed research holds out a big hope for Bangladesh, dispelling the commonly-shared fear of the groundwater reserve getting drier every year, and a Jakarta-like land subsidence resulting from it.""It is a ground-breaking research for all sorts of reasons,"" exclaimed the lead researcher Mohammad Shamsudduha over the phone from London Thursday.Published a month ago in the renowned journal Science, six scientists -- five of whom are Bangladeshis -- wrote in their research paper about a great water reservoir below Bangladesh that hardly runs dry. The more water is pumped out of the ""Bengal Water Machine"", as the researchers called it, the more water is pumped into it from the vertical and horizontal flow of freshwater from the surface and nearby lateral water sources.The machine is being considered by geoscientists as nature's very special gift to the people in the Bengal basin, a vast sediment-filled region upon which lies Bangladesh and a part of West Bengal.""This is a huge discovery for Bangladesh. One-third of Bangladesh is getting the benefit of nature's gift,"" Shamsudduha, a professor at the University College London, told The Daily Star. ""It can revolutionise our farming further, as irrigation strategy could now be set scientifically.""The vast underground reservoir for freshwater was crafted slowly over thousands of years by the Ganges and the Brahmaputra that brought in tons of silt and sediment every year from as far away as the Himalayas to form the delta's spongy soil.The Bengal Water Machine was created but not quite started until the 1980s, when Bangladesh stepped up on its rice production in the dry season. Unknowingly, millions of farmers actually kick-started the natural water system by pumping out groundwater for irrigation.Equipped with pumps and agricultural improvements, drought-hit farmers in the north and north-west have gone for extensive irrigation that enabled Bangladesh to produce enough food each year to be nearly self-sufficient by tripling the country's rice production.The geological formation of this Bengal basin responded strangely to the overdraw of the groundwater, with greater depletion triggering faster recharge.""If there was no pumping, then there would have been no water machine functioning,"" said co-researcher Professor Kazi Matin Uddin Ahmed, who is a hydrogeologist at the University of Dhaka. ""When farmers extract more groundwater, the water level falls and it creates room for additional recharge.""Boosting yields aside, the natural water system is believed to have been helping lessen flooding during monsoon seasons. ""If there is no recharge, all the water would be on the surface. Then, we would have a bigger flood,"" said Matin.The entire ecosystem works like a well-oiled machine: farmers pump water out and the porous soil quickly captures the rain-running-flood water before sending it down to the water machine with filtration through layers of soil on the way. Freshwater is stored in reservoirs at different depths, with the majority amount easily accessible by farmers at 100 feet below.About 1,500-2,000 litres of groundwater are required for the production of only one kg of rice in the dry season. And the amount of groundwater that is being pumped in three months for irrigating Boro paddy is mind-blowing.According to a World Bank study in 2021, about 32 cubic kilometres of groundwater is being extracted by the farmers every year, with which a three-story ""water building"" could be built over Bangladesh.Much to the relief, the researchers have found that the Bengal Water Machine kicks in to dispel most of the overdraw concern. Freshwater amounting to 75-90 cubic kilometres were captured and pumped back into the water machine from 1988-2018. Still, there's a huge shortfall.The withdrawal-recharge ratio is not that encouraging and consistent among all regions of Bangladesh. The rice-producing north is precariously-placed. On the other hand, the west generally experiences less rainfall than the east and it reflects on the outcome. Groundwater depletion is taking place in the west but not in the east, finds research.""Apart from the rice-producing north, the Bengal Water Machine is also not working well in the greater Dhaka region, big cities, and industrial areas,"" said co-researcher Prof Anwar Zahid, also a director at the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB).""We must use the groundwater very judiciously and cautiously, looking at the data. Indiscriminate use will only make a disaster imminent,"" warns Anwar, theleading groundwater expert and a key resource person behind the research that spanned over 10 years.The reason why the research is being so hailed across the globe is because of its foundation, a trove of data painstakingly put together over 30 years by the BWDB.Over a thousand observers of the BWDB wells have been monitoring and recording the underground water levels for 60 years by now. And, the researchers used millions of groundwater measurements from 465 shallow monitoring wells (mostly at 25-70 meters depth, from where pumping for irrigation is done).""Groundwater deeper than that level should not be used for irrigation as recharge by rainfall to that level [over 250-300 meters] takes hundreds to thousands of years,"" Anwar said.The other researchers are Richard G Taylor from University College London, Md Izazul Haq and Sara Nowreen.",2022-10-15

/opinion/views/open-dialogue/news/what-bangladesh-needs-consider-devaluing-the-taka-further-3143341,What Bangladesh needs to consider before devaluing the taka further,"One of the hottest global news items right now is the effect of the dollar's strength on local currencies and on everyday life. Bangladesh loosened its grip on its currency and allowed the taka to weaken to a record low to preserve dwindling dollars. Like many other countries in the developing world, Bangladesh is dependent on imports, and the high cost of the US dollar is creating a drain on dollar reserves and pushing up the price of essential goods. There is hardly a single item in the country that has not been affected.The US dollar, one of four reserve currencies in the global financial system, is now at its highest in 20 years. The strong dollar and high interest rates in the US, UK, and other countries are ""wreaking havoc"" around the world, exporting inflation, forcing developing countries to raise their own interest rates, and leading to capital outflows. Bangladesh, like others, may soon face difficulties in the sphere of debt repayment.Although Bangladesh Bank (BB) puts the official dollar rate at Tk 95, it reached its highest peak in history in the kerb or open market when it hit Tk 119.9 on August 10, and the dollar rate difference between the Bangladeshi interbank channel and kerb market became Tk 25. The trade deficit widened to USD 27.2 billion in the July 2021-May 2022 period as imports surged to nearly USD 59 billion, while exports rose at a slower pace to USD 31.5 billion.The government and monetary authorities now face a dilemma. How much should they adjust the taka to dollar exchange rate, and how fast? The decision has been up in the air for quite a while, and economists, business groups, and other stakeholders have joined the chorus, sometimes offering divergent views on the matter.The negative effect of any devaluation is felt immediately by importers, who now have to recover higher costs of the items they sell by raising prices or taking a cut on their profits. If you are in a competitive market, where imported goods vie with domestic products (as is the case of many electronic goods), the higher cost of imported goods results in reduced demand for the imported item and boosts the sale of local substitutes. The moral of this story is, devaluation helps domestic industries and facilitates ""import substitution,"" providing a boost for exporters.Local reactions to fast and steep devaluation are expected to be mixed. ""Devaluation of taka should be gradual"" was the call made by Mostafa Kamal of Meghna Group of Industries. He and some other businesspeople have cautioned the government against drastic action, arguing currency depreciation might ""have a huge impact on every sphere of the economy and life.""His view was echoed by many others I spoke to. One businessman, who sells Microsoft products, reported that the price of an MS Windows license has already jumped since March 2022 by Tk 3,000-4,000. The members of the FBCCI are openly voicing their concerns regarding the increase in the interbank price of the dollar from Tk 84 to Tk 108.Domestically, inflation has caught families with fixed budgets completely off-guard. Even utilities are becoming costlier. After the gas price hike, a proposal to raise electricity tariffs by 66 percent has been submitted. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Committee has suggested a 58 percent raise for per unit power.Former BB governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed, on the other hand, joined many economists in calling for quick action on adjusting the value of the taka against the dollar to reflect market realities. ""It is time to think about inflation, our competitiveness and exchange rate,"" he said recently. ""The wait-and-see policy will not bring any good. Crises snowballed in Sri Lanka over the last four to five years as the country did not act properly to set things right. I wish Bangladesh will not walk the same path.""Nonetheless, a careful assessment shows that devaluation will hurt the average consumers sharply and will only add marginally to our export earnings. One RMG exporter who was in the US recently told me that the recent down-swing in exports is transitional and will pick up once the war in Ukraine reaches a steady state and US importers take stock of market conditions, particularly the inventory on hand.Bangladesh is dependent on imports; during the first eight months of 2022, it imported goods worth USD 50.2 billion. Of this amount, essential commodities account for 72 percent: USD 5.67 billion for food commodities, 4.41 billion for intermediate goods, 19.28 billion for industrial raw materials and 4.46 billion for petroleum products.The taka has been devalued against the dollar in seven steps this year. This measure adds to the cost of business. The Bangladesh Bank has resisted mounting pressures on the taka for a while, but it is increasingly running out of options. The exchange rate of the dollar against the Bangladeshi taka was Tk 84.9 on January 1, 2020. On August 15, 2022, the rate went up and is currently Tk 95, with a decline of the value of the taka by 12 percent. While this is a significant decrease, the currency has held up better than many others. Currencies of the world's top economies, as well as those of our neighbouring countries, have lost their value against the US dollar. India has spent more than 10 percent of its reserves on interventions in the foreign exchange market, which are down USD 27 billion.There is a silver lining in this bleak scenario. The BB has taken several steps to stem demand for foreign exchange and curb inflation – by raising the repo rate, raising the deposit margin on letters of credit of imports of non-essential items, and restrictions on imports of luxury items. The government has decided to go slow on major projects to manage the import bill of construction materials and hardware.Going forward, Bangladesh Bank can consider a policy regime where exchange rate interventions will not be needed on a regular basis. The Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman had proposed a system where a currency can float a little above and a little below a target rate within a narrow band. This system, also known as ""broad target zones,"" and followed by China among others, would require market intervention only if the market rate drifts far away from the ""fix,"" an exchange rate set by Bangladesh Bank.Dr Abdullah Shibli is an economist and works for Change Healthcare, Inc., an information technology company.

/business/news/coordinated-efforts-needed-cut-inflation-south-asia-3143451,‘Coordinated efforts needed to cut inflation in south Asia’,"Coordinated efforts are needed to cut inflation and increase trade in the south Asian countries, experts said at the daylong SAFA International Conference 2022 today.The Covid-induced economic slowdown disrupted the global supply chain, which got further aggravated by the Russia-Ukraine war, they said.In the post-pandemic world, when all global powers are rethinking about their value chains, South Asian countries must think about further enhancing sub-regional cooperation, they added.They spoke at the conference of the South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) hosted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) at Pan Pacific Sonargaon in Dhaka.At the event, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said Bangladesh should now work for strengthening its regional connectivity and raise its trade with the South Asian peers to ensure sustainable growth on its way to becoming a developing country by 2026.""We have many challenges. However, we can go forward by working together regionally.""There is no shortage of rationale for increasing regional trade cooperation among South Asian countries, said Bangladesh Bank's former governor Atiur Rahman.The trade between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal increased by six times between 2015 and 2019, he said.But still unexploited regional trade potential for Bangladesh remains to be as high as 93 per cent, he added.To utilise the untapped potential, South Asian countries need to invest more on improving regional connectivity, he suggested.Rahman made the remarks while presenting a keynote paper on regional connectivity for sustainable growth.Prof Dr Javed Siddiqui of the accounting and finance division in Alliance Manchester Business School UK, gave a keynote speech on the event's technical session one moderated by Bangladesh Bank Board Director Mahbub Ahmed.Senior Commerce Secretary Tapan Kanti Ghosh moderated the technical session two where ICAB's Council Member Sabbir Ahmed presented another keynote paper on ""Current trend of regional economy: role of Professional Accountancy Organizations"".ICAB President Md Shahadat Hossain also spoke.ICAB organised the last SAFA Conference in 2019.",2022-10-15
/sports/football/news/real-madrid-know-how-orchestrate-campaigns-win-the-ballon-dor-3143251,'Real Madrid know how to orchestrate campaigns to win the Ballon d'Or',"The director of France Football, Pascal Ferre, remains silent on the identity of the next winner of the Ballon d'Or, which will be known this Monday, and in the face of Karim Benzema's status as favourite, he spoke of how Real Madrid know how to orchestrate campaigns to propel their players towards the award.""Florentino Perez orchestrates the campaigns well, tacitly, without drifts, everything he does is authorised,"" Ferre said in an interview with EFE.The head of the magazine that has been awarding the prize since 1956 says that campaigns ""don't make you win, but they can make you lose when there is a bad message or a bad gesture"".""There are machines like Real Madrid that are very strong. Their intelligence is that they support a single player. For years it was Cristiano Ronaldo and now it's Karim Benzema. That prevents votes from being dispersed,"" he says.""They know how it works. It's no coincidence that they're the club that have won it the most times,"" says Ferre in the office he has occupied since 2005.Off the pitch
Ferre recalls that off-field reputation is also a criterion when awarding points, but does not believe that the conviction for complicity in blackmail handed down against Benzema should be an obstacle to him becoming the first Frenchman to win the award since Zinedine Zidane in 1998.""I think that has already been taken into account by the juries, but I don't think it is an essential element. The Ballon d'Or is not the Nobel Peace Prize, they have voted on eleven months of competition,"" he said.Messi's omission
 









For the first time in 15 years, Lionel Messi, winner of seven editions, does not appear among the candidates, ""a gigantic event in the history of the award"", according to Ferre, who considers that ""the Ballon d'Or is Messi and Messi is the Ballon d'Or"".
""His record is going to be very difficult to match, he is someone who embodies the Ballon d'Or well, because he combines individual and collective performance, but also a certain idea of showmanship and longevity,"" he says. He remembers the Argentinian being ""tremendously excited"" when he called him on the last two occasions to announce that he was the winner.
""In 2019 he told me that he had forgotten the pleasure of winning it (three years after the last one), he had realised that he missed it. In 2021 I had the impression that I was talking to a child,"" he says.
Cristiano's emotion

He also recalls Cristiano Ronaldo's excitement when he was announced in several editions and believes that the Portuguese ""has not digested being left behind his great rival"".
""It is a very important award for them. The Ballon d'Or is one of the few things you can't buy. It makes them humble in the face of this kind of reward, it makes them like children,"" he adds.
Messi and Ronaldo ""have been the protagonists of one of the most intense rivalries in the history of sport"", says Ferre, happy that the Ballon d'Or has helped to fuel it, while considering that it will be some time before a similar duel is repeated.
""There is a lot of talk about the rivalry between Mbappe and Haaland, but neither of them have won the Champions League. At Mbappe's age, Messi already had two Ballon d'Ors. If they want to establish a similar rivalry they have to start winning major trophies now. Messi and Ronaldo didn't take that long,"" he says.
Ferre is aware that the Ballon d'Or is not without controversy ""because everyone has their favourites"", but when he reviews the list of winners he believes that ""there is no one who has disgraced the award"".
Xavi and Iniesta, a scar

""I don't think anyone is missing from the list. It's obvious that there are some names missing. In my opinion there are three, Poland's Robert Lewandowski and Spain's Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta,"" he admits.
""For me it's a big scar, because (Xavi and Iniesta) are two players who I rank very highly and who embody football as the Ballon d'Or sees it. But in 2010 they were up against Messi and I think they paid for the fact that, in that Spanish national team, the votes were divided between many names, which reduced their support.""
He knows that, for many, Raul Gonzalez is another of those absent from the list of winners, but he believes that ""he is a step below"" and recalls that he never won the World Cup.
On Lewandowski, Ferre also regrets that the Pole did not win it in 2020, when he was the big favourite but France Football decided not to award it because of the pandemic.
""We did it out of a desire to be fair, not all the championships had stopped. Robert keeps asking me if I don't regret it, but I think we did the right thing,"" he says.
For a few days now, his phone has been ringing off the hook. ""Representatives, clubs, players... they want to know if they've won, it's inevitable.""
The winner of 2022 already knows that he will embrace the golden trophy next Monday. Ferre has already gone through the usual ceremony of announcing it in person at his home.
""We try to keep it as secret as possible. Sometimes we disguise ourselves so that no one sees us arrive. And we tell the winner not to tell his wife or children,"" he says.

/weekend-read/news/unbearable-burden-unemployed-youth-3143096,Unbearable burden on unemployed youth,"The decision to increase the job application fees for government jobs, except for cadre posts, has outraged the country's millions of job seekers who find it an additional burden on them, making their expenses heavier.According to the new circular issued by the finance ministry on September 22, application fees for posts of different grades have been increased up to two to three times the previous rate.For instance, the application fee for 9th-grade jobs has now been fixed at Tk 600. Previously, it was Tk 500, according to the national pay scale 2015.However, the application fee for 10th-grade positions has been kept at Tk 500. There is no fixed application fee for positions from 1st to 8th grades as these are top ranking posts.On the other hand, the fee for 11th to 16th-grade positions rose by Tk 100 to Tk 300. Now the applicants will have to pay Tk 300 as the fees for the 11th and 12th grades, and Tk 200 for the 13th to 16th grades.The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.Earlier, the application fee for 11th to 16th-grade positions was Tk 100, according to the finance ministry circular.The application fee for 17th to 20th-grade positions has doubled to Tk 100 from Tk 50.The jobseekers, many of whom are unemployed, say the move will exert financial pressure on them. Most of them apply for these jobs several times; so they have to spend the additional amount without any return.Even now, many applicants especially those who are from impoverished backgrounds find it extremely difficult to manage enough money to travel to and stay in Dhaka to appear for the job exams.""Many of us may think that Tk 500-600 is an insignificant amount. Yes, it might be when you get a monthly salary. But, for unemployed youth like us, every penny matters a lot,"" said Md Tobarak Hossain, a National University graduate who has been applying for government jobs for three years.""After the pandemic, many government organisations are posting job circulars. Last month, I applied for four positions and had to pay around Tk 2,000 as application fees. I had to struggle a lot to collect this money as I have no income currently. Increasing application fees in such a time will prove to be a massive blow for us,"" he said.I am struggling to collect money for submitting applications in October while saving some for the exams in November and December. This type of recruitment system where unemployed people have to pay a hefty amount is unjust.
Another jobseeker, Sumaya Khanam said apart from the application fees, they need to spend a huge amount of money for travel to take the recruitment tests.
""In August, I had to travel to Dhaka from my hometown Dinajpur three times to sit for those exams. I had to spend around Tk 15,000 that month just to travel to and stay in Dhaka to appear at the exams,"" she said.
There are several written exams coming up in November and December and application submission deadlines in October, she said.
""I am struggling to collect money for submitting applications in October while saving some for the exams in November and December. This type of recruitment system where unemployed people have to pay a hefty amount is unjust.""
Again, jobseekers are apprehensive that the finance ministry's move will encourage public sector enterprises to increase their application fee as they have been exempted in the circular.
Job application fees set by these organisations are already much higher than the usual fees for other government jobs.
This correspondent analysed recently published 10 circulars of different public enterprises and found that application fees range from Tk 700 to over Tk 1,000.
For instance, Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) published a circular for recruiting medical officers where the application fee was Tk 1,000.
Similarly, Rural Power Company Limited published a job circular for positions ranging from grade 10 to grade 4. However, the application fee for all applicants was Tk 1,000.
Khulna Development Authority published a circular for 16 positions. For the positions of assistant engineer (9th grade) and sub-assistant engineer (10th grade), the application fee was Tk 700. For all other positions, the application fee was Tk 500.
On the other hand, Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited (DPDC) will recruit 33 assistant engineers and the application fee it charged was Tk 1,500.
""If these state-run enterprises also increase the job application fees following the finance ministry's decision, it will be impossible for us to apply for many of these jobs. The government has been imposing an unbearable burden on us in the name of job application fees and recruitment exams,"" said Sumaya.
The finance ministry, however, claims that they have not increased the application fees, it was ""adjusted"" for the benefit of the job seekers.
Md Golam Mostofa, additional secretary (regulation) of the finance ministry, told The Daily Star, ""Previously application fee for 9th-grade and 10th-grade jobs was the same. We have just slightly increased the fee for 9th-grade positions but did not increase the latter.""
The application fee for positions of 11th to 16th grade was the same but their salary was not equal. ""So, we have re-adjusted the application according to the grade of the positions in accordance with the pay scale,"" he said.
Golam Mostofa said the government does not intend to earn from the application fees. Even the application fees barely cover 10 percent of the expenditure required to arrange job exams.
""We take these fees as a token money from the job seekers so that they take the exams seriously.""
Asked how this decision will be enforced and why the state-run enterprises have been exempted, he commented, ""The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.""
""State-run enterprises are supposed to run on their own income. This is why we have exempted them from this measure,"" he added.
Experts, however, have opined against this step saying that the step would cause suffering for millions of job seekers and unemployed youths.
Former Cabinet Secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, ""We expected the government would decrease job application fees considering the current economic situation. Increasing application fees at this time when many people have been suffering from income loss due to the pandemic is not the appropriate step.
""There can be a fee for applying for government jobs but that fee has to be nominal and affordable for all citizens.""

However, the application fee for all applicants was Tk 1,000.Khulna Development Authority published a circular for 16 positions. For the positions of assistant engineer (9th grade) and sub-assistant engineer (10th grade), the application fee was Tk 700. For all other positions, the application fee was Tk 500.On the other hand, Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited (DPDC) will recruit 33 assistant engineers and the application fee it charged was Tk 1,500.""If these state-run enterprises also increase the job application fees following the finance ministry's decision, it will be impossible for us to apply for many of these jobs. The government has been imposing an unbearable burden on us in the name of job application fees and recruitment exams,"" said Sumaya.The finance ministry, however, claims that they have not increased the application fees, it was ""adjusted"" for the benefit of the job seekers.Md Golam Mostofa, additional secretary (regulation) of the finance ministry, told The Daily Star, ""Previously application fee for 9th-grade and 10th-grade jobs was the same. We have just slightly increased the fee for 9th-grade positions but did not increase the latter.""The application fee for positions of 11th to 16th grade was the same but their salary was not equal. ""So, we have re-adjusted the application according to the grade of the positions in accordance with the pay scale,"" he said.Golam Mostofa said the government does not intend to earn from the application fees. Even the application fees barely cover 10 percent of the expenditure required to arrange job exams.""We take these fees as a token money from the job seekers so that they take the exams seriously.""Asked how this decision will be enforced and why the state-run enterprises have been exempted, he commented, ""The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.""""State-run enterprises are supposed to run on their own income. This is why we have exempted them from this measure,"" he added.Experts, however, have opined against this step saying that the step would cause suffering for millions of job seekers and unemployed youths.Former Cabinet Secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, ""We expected the government would decrease job application fees considering the current economic situation. Increasing application fees at this time when many people have been suffering from income loss due to the pandemic is not the appropriate step.""There can be a fee for applying for government jobs but that fee has to be nominal and affordable for all citizens.""  ",2022-10-15

/daily-star-books/news/love-fate-and-age-old-curses-the-book-magic-alice-hoffman-3143441,"Love, fate, and age-old curses: 'The Book of Magic' by Alice Hoffman","Jet Owens has only seven days to live. With the deathwatch beetle following her everywhere, Jet knows that her time has come. In her late 80s, Jet is a kind, warm woman, trying her best to help those in need. Yet, her life seems unfulfilled and there is one last thing she needs to take care of before embracing death. What is it, then, that is bothering a woman in this seemingly late chapter of her life?As Alice Hoffman unfolds the story in this book and brings an end to her The Practical Magic (Simon Schuster, 2020) series, readers find the enchanted Owens women embarking on a menacing journey that involves coming in close contact with the Dark side or ""left-handed"" magic, as the author puts it.An adventurous young adult read, full of enchantments, emotions, and familial bond, The Book of Magic (Simon & Schuster, 2021) is something readers might relish if they are looking to read in the supernatural/fantasy genre. Set across the United States of America and England, the book follows the mystical Owens women who have set out on a journey in order to break a curse that has steered their lives for centuries. Whoever they fall in love with meets with an untimely death. How can one bear to live while a loved one is perishing right in front of their eyes? The readers confront such questions throughout the entire novel that connects them to the storyline easily. As the narrative unfolds, the writer tells of a curse that has loomed over the family members for centuries, and Jet Owens sets off on a mission to end it while the deathwatch beetle keeps clicking away. She goes to the library and seeks out ""The Book of the Raven"", a book that holds the key to ending the notorious curse. Yet, the path is as difficult as can be since the one who embarks upon it will lose something precious. While Jet breathes her last and is buried beside her childhood sweetheart, a series of tragic events take place in the Owens family. Gideon, the love of Kylie's life, is met with a sudden accident. As he is lying in the hospital bed battling for his life, Kylie realises that the abrupt catastrophe and Gideon's critical condition are all but a work of the curse. She sets out on a dangerous journey to rectify their circumstances and quickly finds herself in a place where Gideon's isn't the only life hanging by a thread.The familial bond portrayed in the novel makes it easy to sympathise with the characters and they rarely seem woven in a piece of fiction; rather, their attributes are more lifelike and one may just find someone like Franny or Gillian Owens among their kith and kin. However, the family line in the novel can be a little difficult to decipher and the descriptions sometimes come off as too dense. Nonetheless, Alice Hoffman weaves the ending well and The Book of Magic is perhaps some sort of a closure, being the last one in the series of four.Shejuti Pasha loves reading along with a cup of coffee.

/business/economy/opinion/news/asia-sails-headwinds-rate-hikes-war-and-china-slowdown-3143256,"Asia sails into headwinds from rate hikes, war, and China slowdown","Asia's strong economic rebound early this year is losing momentum, with a weaker-than-expected second quarter. We have cut growth forecasts for Asia and the Pacific to 4 per cent this year and 4.3 per cent next year, which are well below the 5.5 per cent average over the last two decades. Despite this, Asia remains a relative bright spot in an increasingly dimming global economy.Waning momentum reflects three formidable headwinds, which may prove to be persistent:A sharp tightening of financial conditions, which is raising government borrowing costs and is likely to become even more constricting, as central banks in major advanced economies continue to raise interest rates to tame the fastest inflation in decades. Rapidly depreciating currencies could further complicate policy challenges.Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is still raging and continues to trigger a sharp slowdown of economic activity in Europe that will further reduce external demand for Asian exports.China's strict zero-COVID policy and the related lockdowns, which, coupled with a deepening turmoil in the real estate sector, has led to an uncharacteristic and sharp slowdown in growth, that in turn is weakening momentum in connected economies.BROAD SLOWDOWNAfter near-zero growth in the second quarter, China will recover modestly in the second half to reach full-year growth of 3.2 per cent and accelerate to 4.4 per cent next year, assuming pandemic restrictions are gradually loosened.In Japan, we expect growth to remain unchanged at 1.7 per cent this year before slowing to 1.6 per cent next year, weighed down by weak external demand. Korea's growth in 2022 was revised up to 2.6 per cent due to a strong second-quarter growth but revised down to 2 per cent in 2023 reflecting external headwinds. India's economy will expand, albeit more slowly than previously expected, by 6.8 per cent this year and 6.1 per cent in 2023, owing to a weakening of external demand and a tightening of monetary and financial conditions that are expected to weigh on growth.Southeast Asia is likely to enjoy a strong recovery. In Vietnam, which is benefitting from its growing importance in global supply chains, we expect 7 per cent growth and a slight moderation next year. The Philippines is forecast to see a 6.5 per cent expansion this year, while growth will top 5 per cent in Indonesia and Malaysia.Cambodia and Thailand will expand faster in 2023 on a likely pickup in foreign tourism. In Myanmar, which has endured a deep recession due to the coup and pandemic, growth this year is expected to stabilise at a low level amid continued unrest and suffering.The outlook is more challenging for other Asian frontier markets. Sri Lanka is still experiencing a severe economic crisis, though the authorities have reached an agreement with IMF staff on a programme that will help to stabilise the economy.In Bangladesh, the war in Ukraine and high commodity prices has dampened a robust recovery from the pandemic. The authorities have preemptively requested an IMF-supported programme that will bolster the external position, and access to the IMF's new Resilience and Sustainability Trust to meet their large climate financing need, both of which will strengthen their ability to deal with future shocks.High debt economies such as the Maldives, Lao P.D.R., and Papua New Guinea, and those facing refinancing risks, like Mongolia, are also facing challenges as the tide changes.We expect growth across Pacific Island countries to rebound strongly next year to 4.2 per cent from 0.8 per cent this year as tourism-based economies benefit from eased travel restrictions.INFLATION REMAINS ELEVATEDInflation now exceeds central bank targets in most Asian economies, driven by a mix of global food and energy prices, currencies falling against the US dollar, and shrinking output gaps. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has also risen and its persistence—driven by inflation expectations and wages—must be closely monitored.Meanwhile, the US dollar has strengthened against most major currencies as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and signals further hikes to come. Most Asian emerging market currencies have lost between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of their value against the dollar this year, while the yen has depreciated by more than 20 per cent. These recent depreciations have started passing through to core inflation across the region, and this may keep inflation high for longer than previously expected.Finally, spikes in global food and energy prices early this year threatened to abruptly raise the cost of living across the region, with particularly strong implications for the real incomes of lower-income households that spend more of their disposable income on these commodities.POLICY FOR CHALLENGING TIMESAmid lower growth, policymakers face complex challenges that will require strong responses.Central banks will need to persevere with their policy tightening until inflation durably falls back to target. Exchange rates should be allowed to adjust to reflect fundamentals, including the terms of trade—a measure of prices for a country's exports relative to its imports—and foreign monetary policy decisions.But if global shocks lead to a spike in borrowing rates unrelated to domestic policy changes and/or threaten financial stability or undermine the central bank's ability to stabilise inflation expectations, foreign-exchange interventions may become a useful part of the policy mix for countries with adequate reserves, alongside macroprudential policies.Countries should urgently consider improving their liquidity buffers, including by requesting access to precautionary instruments from the Fund for those eligible.Public debt has risen substantially in Asia over the past 15 years—particularly in the advanced economies and China—and rose further during the pandemic. Fiscal policy should continue its gradual consolidation to moderate demand alongside monetary policy, focused on the medium-term goal of stabilising public debt.Accordingly, measures to shield vulnerable populations from the rising cost of living will need to be well-targeted and temporary. In countries with high debt levels, support will need to be budget-neutral to maintain the path of fiscal consolidation. Credible medium-term fiscal frameworks remain an imperative.Beyond the short term, policies must focus on healing the damage inflicted by the pandemic and war. Scarring from the pandemic and current headwinds are likely to be sizable in Asia, in part because of elevated leverage among companies that will weigh on private investment and education losses from school closures that could erode human capital if remedial measures aren't taken today.Strong international cooperation is needed to prevent greater geoeconomic fragmentation and to ensure that trade aids growth. There is an urgent need for ambitious structural changes to boost the region's productive potential and address the climate crisis.Krishna Srinivasan is the director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the International Monetary Fund.  Shanaka Jayanath Peiris is the Asia and Pacific Department's Division Chief of Regional Studies.",2022-10-15

Initiated by Azizee Fawmi Khan, Doob 2.0 is an attempt to point out the changes in our biodiversity caused by gradual urbanisation.Back in the 20th century, Dhaka city was a flourishing place with birds and other animals, and more green spaces. But alas! Our greed for built spaces has destroyed the natural beauty of the city. All we can see around us is a concrete jungle. The water bodies, the green areas, the birds and other small animals- they are hardly to be seen. The artists of Doob 2.0 bring us the images of the previous version of Dhaka versus the current one, blended with nostalgia and undying yearning.The miniaturesque pieces have filled the mini exhibition hall of EMK center. The first pair of artworks on the wall is called Leaf Story, Taniya Rahman Roshney's hand embroidery of houseplants on canvas, her fond memories of student life, and her friendship with nature. Mukta Mareeam Khan has used natural ingredients for her art piece, painting adorable frogs asking for rain on summer days. She was inspired by the folktales of her village and the folk song 'Ashare Golpo', that she sang herself.The cutest artwork I found was Arzina Ahasan's 'Unnoticed'. On her quest to frame unnoticed beauty of nature, the artist used grass, leaves, flowers, shells, and wooden scraps to recreate the biodiversity of her native village. Her work mainly focuses on portraying birds and plants, which she made permanent with resin.Another remarkable work is Nusrat Jahan Titly's 'Recreational Apiarist' is a memoir of her grandfather's love for bees.She wonders when was the last time a beehive formed naturally where she lives in. She used a wooden frame, recycles paper, and beads to form a beehive with intricate details. Sarah Jabin's 'Home Sweet Home' is a soap composite carving of columns from ancient civilisations, where she made little spaces to accommodate animals and birds.Afroza Hossain Sara used songs, drawing, and motions to hand-draw a digital animation of the cranes around Banani lake that, despite the pollution, population, and climate change. Ananya Mehpar Azad did a gorgeous portrayal of the goddess Dhakeshwari, the protector of Dhaka city, surrounded by her long lost rich biodiversity using fabric color and sequin embellishment on silk.Aside from these, all the other artists have produced remarkable art pieces that represent a desperate call for the protection of nature, along with their charming aesthetics. EMK Center will run this exhibition till October 22, 2022. ",2022-10-15

/sports/cricket/news/india-women-seventh-heaven-3143351,India women on seventh heaven,"India produced yet another dominant display to take home their seventh Women's Asia Cup title as they brushed aside Sri Lanka with an eight-wicket victory in the grand finale at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Saturday.Favourites India, who are the tournament's most successful side, showed their pedigree and experience in the final as their counterparts Sri Lanka crumbled, posting a meagre 65-9 after opting to bat first.India pacer Renuka Singh was the pick of the bowlers scalping three wickets for just five runs which brought her the player of the match award.Indian batters showed no jitters and romped to the target on the back of opener Smriti Mandhana's fifty as the right-hander hit a six to finish off proceedings.Earlier, Sri Lanka got off to the worst possible start as opener Chamari Athapaththu got run out in the third over for six runs. Renuka then nicked off Harshitha Samarawickrama to add to their misery; the other opener Anushka Sanjeewani was also run out while attempting to complete a tight single.Renuka added two more to her figures and the spinners settled in, leaving Sri Lanka in dire straits at 16-5.Inoka Ranaweera top-scored with 18 runs as the reeling Lankans played out the 20 overs posting 65.Besides, Renuka's three, left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad and off-spinner Sneh Rana picked up two wickets each, while Deepti Sharma, who topped the wicket-takers chart, went wicketless.In reply, India lost experienced opener Shafali Verma for five and Jemimah Rodrigues for two inside the powerplay but Smriti motored on and smashed an unbeaten 51 runs off 25 balls as she hit six fours and three sixes and hit the winning runs with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur at the other end.""We should credit our bowlers.

/business/economy/opinion/news/how-countries-should-respond-the-strong-dollar-3143241,How countries should respond to the strong dollar,"The dollar is at its highest level since 2000, having appreciated 22 per cent against the yen, 13 per cent against the euro and 6 per cent against emerging market currencies since the start of this year. Such a sharp strengthening of the dollar in a matter of months has sizable macroeconomic implications for almost all countries, given the dominance of the dollar in international trade and finance.While the US share in world merchandise exports has declined from 12 per cent to 8 per cent since 2000, the dollar's share in world exports has held around 40 per cent. For many countries fighting to bring down inflation, the weakening of their currencies relative to the dollar has made the fight harder.On average, the estimated pass-through of a 10 per cent dollar appreciation into inflation is 1 per cent. Such pressures are especially acute in emerging markets, reflecting their higher import dependency and greater share of dollar-invoiced imports compared with advanced economies.The dollar's appreciation also is reverberating through balance sheets around the world. Approximately half of all cross-border loans and international debt securities are denominated in US dollars. While emerging market governments have made progress in issuing debt in their own currency, their private corporate sectors have high levels of dollar-denominated debt.As world interest rates rise, financial conditions have tightened considerably for many countries. A stronger dollar only compounds these pressures, especially for some emerging market and many low-income countries that are already at a high risk of debt distress.In these circumstances, should countries actively support their currencies? Several countries are resorting to foreign exchange interventions. Total foreign reserves held by emerging market and developing economies fell by more than 6 per cent in the first seven months of this year.The appropriate policy response to depreciation pressures requires a focus on the drivers of the exchange rate change and on signs of market disruptions. Specifically, foreign exchange intervention should not substitute for warranted adjustment to macroeconomic policies. There is a role for intervening on a temporary basis when currency movements substantially raise financial stability risks and/or significantly disrupt the central bank's ability to maintain price stability.As of now, economic fundamentals are a major factor in the appreciation of the dollar: rapidly rising US interest rates and a more favourable terms-of-trade—a measure of prices for a country's exports relative to its imports—for the US caused by the energy crisis.Fighting a historic increase in inflation, the Federal Reserve has embarked on a rapid tightening path for policy interest rates. The European Central Bank, while also facing broad-based inflation, has signaled a shallower path for their policy rates, out of concern that the energy crisis will cause an economic downturn. Meanwhile, low inflation in Japan and China has allowed their central banks to buck the global tightening trend.The massive terms-of-trade shock triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the second major driver behind the dollar's strength. The euro area is highly reliant on energy imports, in particular natural gas from Russia. The surge in gas prices has brought its terms of trade to the lowest level in the history of the shared currency.As for emerging markets and developing economies beyond China, many were ahead in the global monetary tightening cycle—perhaps in part out of concern about their dollar exchange rate—while commodity exporting EMDEs experienced a positive terms-of-trade shock. Consequently, exchange-rate pressures for the average emerging market economy have been less severe than for advanced economies, and some, such as Brazil and Mexico, have even appreciated.Given the significant role of fundamental drivers, the appropriate response is to allow the exchange rate to adjust, while using monetary policy to keep inflation close to its target. The higher price of imported goods will help bring about the necessary adjustment to the fundamental shocks as it reduces imports, which in turn helps with reducing the buildup of external debt. Fiscal policy should be used to support the most vulnerable without jeopardising inflation goals.Additional steps are also needed to address several downside risks on the horizon. Importantly, we could see far greater turmoil in financial markets, including a sudden loss of appetite for emerging market assets that prompts large capital outflows, as investors retreat to safe assets.ENHANCE RESILIENCEIn this fragile environment, it is prudent to enhance resilience. Although emerging market central banks have stockpiled dollar reserves in recent years, reflecting lessons learned from earlier crises, these buffers are limited and should be used prudently.Countries must preserve vital foreign reserves to deal with potentially worse outflows and turmoil in the future. Those that are able should reinstate swap lines with advanced-economy central banks.Countries with sound economic policies in need of addressing moderate vulnerabilities should proactively avail themselves of the IMF's precautionary lines to meet future liquidity needs. Those with large foreign-currency debts should reduce foreign-exchange mismatches by using capital-flow management or macroprudential policies, in addition to debt management operations to smooth repayment profiles.In addition to fundamentals, with financial markets tightening, some countries are seeing signs of market disruptions such as rising currency hedging premia and local currency financing premia. Severe disruptions in shallow currency markets would trigger large changes in these premia, potentially causing macroeconomic and financial instability.In such cases, temporary foreign exchange intervention may be appropriate. This can also help prevent adverse financial amplification if a large depreciation increases financial stability risks, such as corporate defaults, due to mismatches.Finally, temporary intervention can also support monetary policy in the rare circumstances where a large exchange rate depreciation could de-anchor inflation expectations, and monetary policy alone cannot restore price stability.For the United States, despite the global fallout from a strong dollar and tighter global financial conditions, monetary tightening remains the appropriate policy while US inflation remains so far above target. Not doing so would damage central bank credibility, de-anchor inflation expectations, and necessitate even more tightening later—and greater spillovers to the rest of the world.That said, the Fed should keep in mind that large spillovers are likely to spill back into the US economy. In addition, as a global provider of the world's safe asset, the US could reactivate currency swap lines to eligible countries, as it extended at the start of the pandemic, to provide an important safety valve in times of currency market stress. These would usefully complement dollar funding provided by the Fed's standing Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility.The IMF will continue to work closely with our members to craft appropriate macroeconomic policies in these turbulent times, relying on our Integrated Policy Framework. Beyond precautionary financing facilities available for eligible countries, the IMF stands ready to extend our lending resources to member countries experiencing balance of payments problems.Gita Gopinath is the First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund.

/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/does-dhaka-need-more-fashion-shows-3143401,Does Dhaka need more fashion shows?,"Fashion shows have always been a great platform for fashion designers to promote their couture houses. We often see glamorous international fashion shows on television or social media, but how often do our local fashion designers get the right podium? From an economic perspective if designers in Dhaka city offer more fashion shows it will generate a huge amount of revenue for our fashion industry. Fashion shows create numerous opportunities for brands, designers, models, photographers, editors, influencers, and celebrities. If we look into international fashion shows, nowadays, they are less open to the public and are generally organised by the brands or the authorised fashion bodies. Previously, fashion designers unveiled their latest collections via runway shows for their potential buyers and editors, but since 1993 when the New York Fashion Show took place, it has taken the international fashion industry to the next level. New York, Paris, Milan, and London all the famous fashion cities now offer fashion weeks. They bring out four different seasonal collections each year. Indian fashion designers also get to showcase their work via Lakme Fashion Week twice a year. Many fashion influencers visit these series of fashion events; it is a great way for purchasing haute couture and building your network within the industry.Bangladesh has a broad collection of quality handloom fabrics used by many well-established local designers. Our heritage designs and patterns are rich, sophisticated, sustainable, and most importantly handmade. Most fabrics are made from natural dyes, keeping in mind the environment, culture, and religion. The traditional Jamdani and Benaroshi saris are a huge part of our handloom woven culture, and if we as a fashion industry offer more fashion shows we will be able to promote our legacy even further. Many artisans work more than 180 hours behind each hand-embroidered sari or shalwar kameez. The practice of traditional motifs, nakshi kanthas, and block prints are all narrating beautiful stories about the history of Bangladeshi fashion, most of which are fading away due to the lack of exposure.Bangladeshi fashion designers who make handcrafted leather footwear and timeless jute bags could use the fashion shows to highlight their quality work to become global. Through this process, the long-lived tradition of handmade embroidery will stay alive. I believe it is always important to remember our brown roots and acknowledge our diverse bridal couture collections. Indian and Pakistani bridal collections are outstanding, but what if we have our own Bangladeshi bridal couture week? Now that is something to talk about and of course, it will help our customers to wear something made in Bangladesh for their special day. The rich heritage of Bangladeshi fabric can only grow through more fashion shows, digital media, and an eco-friendly environment. Fashion shows can be a tool for public awareness, they can create enthusiasm among the audience to purchase sustainable and reusable masterpieces. As our industry always battles against fast fashion and tries to create earth-friendly designer products. Fashion shows can help designers to reach out to more people and educate them to buy fewer but more valuable outfits. The moment you wear your grandmother's traditional sari at your university convocation, you are not only remembering her but also carrying the family heritage of being a brown child. It is like what Coco Chanel once said, ""Every day is a fashion show and the world is your runway""In recent years Instagram has been one of the biggest game changers for the fashion industry, many brands go live during their fashion shows to reach out to their followers directly. According to Forbes magazine, ""Social media provides all relevant guidance for the fashion shows nowadays, each post shared by celebrities creates a big impact on the designer's new collection."" In a recent Fendi fashion show they used throne to live telecast the entire show on social media. We have also seen Givenchy experience their fashion show with all plus-size models to grab the full attention of Gen Z. If we have more frequent fashion shows in Dhaka and promote them through Instagram, it will be a great source of constant connection between the designers and the customers. The shows can invite fashion experts and bloggers to associate with the global fashion market. It can provide a great place to meet new creative people who share the same passion, enabling a chance to view the hard work of our local fashion designers.In modern times fashion shows have become a piece of art, they work on the theme, stage, and choreography and hire a huge team for the production. If Dhaka offers more fashion shows there will be room for so many new job opportunities for creative younger graduates. Bangladeshi fashion industry deserves to be globally recognised and I believe more fashion shows will help us focus on our trademark designs, craftsmanship, and sustainability. ",2022-10-15

/entertainment/tv-film/news/moshari-chilling-narrative-the-reality-women-3144291,‘Moshari’: A chilling narrative on the reality of women,"Spoilers AheadOn Saturday, Nuhash Humayun's horror-short, ""Moshari"", was released worldwide on Vimeo. The movie won multiple awards at the Atlanta Film Festival, Bucheon International Film Festival, Melbourne International Film Festival and Woodstock Film Festival.It was neither the uneasy ambience of shadows and flickering lights, nor the eerie background score that struck me while watching Nuhash Humayun's ""Moshari"". Rather, the hardest blow was realising that the reason I caught onto the underlying representation from the get go was simply because I was a woman—watching the very reality of my existence through a work of horror-fiction.""Moshari"" follows the story of two sisters in a post-apocalyptic world, where bloodthirsty creatures referred to as vampires, haunt the earth after daylight disappears. To stay safe from these creatures that arrive at the slightest scent of blood, one must stay inside a moshari (mosquito net) until the sun comes up. It all seemed like a standard setup for a dystopian world until a particular detail caught my attention.Early on in the film, there is a public announcement that even the first world countries have fallen against these monsters, but Bangladesh is still doing well against them—as most of the population is shown abiding by the regulations.The fact that the male voice behind the announcement takes a particular pride in making this announcement, while also urging everyone to hurriedly coop up inside their moshari before sundown, and that the protagonists are a girl and a young woman seen doing exactly that, immediately rings a bell.""Moshari"" is a chilling commentary about our patriarchal society, that sees it fit to violate women however possible, unless they stay inside like prisoners in their own space and 'cover up'. The monsters themselves are none other than the men, sick with the plague of misogyny, who don't even spare children from their vile actions.The 22-minutes-long film delivers as much in visual metaphors, as it does in symbolic dialogues. Young Ayra's (Nairah Onora Saif) unwillingness to escape to safety as soon as it's dark like everybody else, her curiosity and rebellious nature unveils the heart-breaking unfairness and oppression women undergo.The scene where Ayra sternly tells the monster that he cannot invade her hiding spot, while being unable to breathe because of his presence, is a stark parallel to the violation of personal space and bodily autonomy women face on a daily basis.At first it may seem odd that Sunehra Binte Kamal, who plays Ayra's elder sister, is referred to only as ""Apu"" throughout the entire duration. We never learn so much as her name. However, why would we, as she perishes in the end anyway?After all, our society and system strips down a woman's identity in order to tag her as a mere victim when she falls prey to their own collective failure. Yet another applaudable aspect of ""Moshari"" is that instead of overdoing ostentatious jump-scares, the monsters are shown lurking in the shadows in multiple shots, mostly in frame, in a somewhat intimate normalcy. This strongly establishes how the people they represent are everywhere around us, more often than not inside our own homes.

/middle-east/news/iran-prison-fire-4-killed-61-injured-protests-continue-3144311,"Iran prison fire: 4 killed, 61 injured as protests continue","A fire at Iran's Evin prison late on Saturday killed four detainees and injured 61, state media reported, as anti-government protests sparked by a woman's death in police custody continued on Sunday, including at several universities.Iranian authorities said on Saturday that a prison workshop had been set on fire ""after a fight among a number of prisoners convicted of financial crimes and theft"". Evin holds many detainees facing security charges, including Iranians with dual nationality.Iran's judiciary said four of those injured in Saturday's fire were in critical condition and that those killed had died of smoke inhalation, Iranian state media reported.Earlier state television aired video apparently showing that calm had returned to the facility.The protests sparked by 22-year-old Mahsa Amini's death while in the custody of Iran's morality police on Sept. 16 have turned into one of the boldest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 revolution, and have been met with a brutal state crackdown.Rights groups say at least 240 protesters have been killed, including 32 minors. The authorities have not published a death toll.Protests continued at several universities on Sunday, including in the cities of Tabriz and Rasht, to a heavy deployment of riot police. Videos posted on social media showed students at a Tehran university chanting: ""Iran has turned into a big prison. Evin prison has become a slaughterhouse.""Reuters could not independently verify the footage.Families of some political detainees at Evin prison took to social media to call on the authorities to ensure their safety, which in 2018 was blacklisted by the U.S. government for ""serious human rights abuses"".Footage of the prison aired on state television hours later showed firefighters inspecting a workshop with fire damage to the roof. It also showed inmates asleep in their wards.Atena Daemi, a human rights activist, said that relatives of prisoners held in the women's section had gathered at the prison for routine visiting hours, but that the authorities had denied them access, resulting in a standoff.The relatives were told that the prisoners were ""fine, but the phones are broken"", according to Daemi. However, she later tweeted that some women prisoners had called their families briefly.A lawyer representing an American Iranian held at Evin, Siamak Namazi, imprisoned for nearly seven years on espionage-related charges rejected by Washington as baseless, said on Sunday that Namazi had contacted his relatives.Several other dual national Iranians and foreign citizens are held in Evin prison mostly for security-related charges.""I am pleased to report that #SiamakNamazi has now spoken to his family. He is safe and has been moved to a secure area of Evin Prison. We have no further details at this time,"" Jared Genser said in a tweet.The husband of Iranian journalist Niloofar Hamedi, who broke the news of Amini's death and was arrested last month, also wrote on Twitter that she had telephoned him on Sunday.VIOLENT CRACKDOWNAsked about the prison fire, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters during a campaign trip on Saturday to Portland, Oregon that the Iranian government was ""so oppressive"" and that he was surprised by the courage of the Iranian protesters.Iran's foreign ministry said Biden had interfered in state matters by showing support for the anti-government protests.Rights groups said at least 240 protesters had been killed in the anti-government protests, including 32 minors. Over 8,000 people had been arrested in 111 cities and towns, Iranian activist news agency HRANA said on Saturday.Among the casualties have been teenage girls whose deaths have become a rallying cry for more demonstrations across the country.Iran, which has blamed the violence on enemies at home and abroad, deny security forces have killed protesters. State media said on Saturday at least 26 members of the security forces had been killed by ""rioters"".The protests have attracted international condemnation, with the United States, Canada and some European countries imposing sanctions on Iranian officials and organisations they accuse of being involved in the clampdown on protesters.""On Saturday ... Biden interfered in Iran's state matters by supporting the riots ... In recent days, the U.S. administration has tried desperately to inflame unrest in Iran under various excuses,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said, Iran's state media reported.The protests mark one of the boldest challenges to clerical rule since the 1979 revolution, with demonstrations spreading across the country and widespread calls for the downfall the Islamic Republic, even if the unrest does not seem close to toppling the system.",2022-10-16
/entertainment/tv-film/news/rubeus-hagrid-remembering-the-gentle-giant-who-stole-our-hearts-3144246,Rubeus Hagrid: Remembering the gentle giant who stole our hearts,"My first exposure to the Harry Potter series was through the movies, eventually leading to me reading the books. Since then, I've been eagerly waiting for my letter from Hogwarts.Even with all the magical adventures, classes, quidditch matches, broomsticks, and wands, one character that really stood out for me was the half-giant, half-wizard Hagrid.The night Harry discovers he's a wizard is almost portrayed like a horror film in the first Harry Potter movie. To avoid the letters warning him of his magic, his uncle takes Harry, along with the rest of the obnoxious Dursleys to a cabin on a distant island.Nevertheless, Hagrid shows up in person to deliver Harry's letter to Hogwarts, busting down the door after the Dursleys refuse to let him in. Even though his initial silhouette frightens everyone including Harry, as soon as he speaks, Harry realises that Hagrid is a friendly visitor and not a terrifying monster.The Scottish actor, Robbie Coltrane, the man behind the loveable giant passed away on Friday at the age of 72. For a generation of Potterheads, Coltrane was best known for his eight-film-run as Hagrid. The character, as he appeared in the book, was a bumbling, whimsical, and devoted ally to Harry and his friends.Coltrane, who was already six-feet-tall, had to wear a padded jacket and use extremely small props and sets to get into the character of the giant and really tower over his co-stars. However, being Hagrid was more than just a physical challenge for the actor. Over the course of a decade, Coltrane gave the character a depth and humanity that helped him become not just instantly recognisable, but also real. And he did all of this while gently resisting the script's tendency to make the character into one used for comic relief.In an interview, Coltrane revealed that he had read the books to his children, which is how he came to know and adore them. ""If you're an actor, you have to do the voices. The children expect it. No monotones allowed,"" he had joked.In the books, Hagrid was a peculiar adult, who fit in more with Harry and his friends—who would frequently visit him for tea and conversations—which is somewhat ironic given that he is a giant. Hagrid was the groundskeeper of Hogwarts, after being expelled from the magical school as a young man, resulting in him being somewhat childish. He's the kind of eccentric personality who names a submissive bloodhound ""Fang"", while naming a fearsome three-headed dog ""Fluffy"".However, his love for animals and magical creatures is truly what makes him the 'gentle giant', as he can be seen caring for man-eating spiders and dangerous dragons with the utmost care.The movies stayed mostly true to Hagrid's narrative, but they frequently made fun of and gawked at his character. In the first film, Hagrid gives Harry a birthday cake, with the icing misspelled as 'Happee Birthdae', a needless insult to his intelligence given that it was never done in the books. In the fourth movie, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", Hagrid accidentally stabs a co-worker in the hand with a fork due to his attraction to a romantic interest, this pretty severe example of his ungainliness wasn't in the text either. Characters frequently gave Hagrid the silent treatment when he spoke, rolling their eyes or making faces at him as if he were stupid, all of which feels rather unfair.Coltrane, however, avoided adopting a caricature-like approach when portraying Hagrid. Instead, he used the character's backstory—like that fact that he was tormented by his Hogwarts peers, abandoned by his giantess mother, and desperately trying to hide his genetic heritage—to help audiences connect with Hagrid.Even at his most ridiculous moments, Hagrid had a hopefulness and a tenderness that portrayed the character's difficult past. The actor seemed to comprehend Hagrid's struggles that gave him a fortitude that didn't turn into bitterness, but rather into a genuine capacity to accept characters like Harry, Ron, and Hermione—those who also struggled to fit in with the rest of the school.Consider the scene where Hagrid introduces the trio to his half-brother, the enormous Grawp. The dialogue calls for Hagrid to be emphatic about their assistance, as he needs the trio to keep Grawp company while he's away. He explains, ""He's completely harmless, just like I said,"" he explains, ""though high-spirited is all… You will look after him, won't you?""Coltrane spoke these words softly rather than firmly—almost fighting back tears—helping the audience understand that Hagrid is feeling guilty and desperate about the request.Aside from the second movie, Hagrid was rarely the centre of attention, but his sympathy for the heroes kept the story's heart alive, and Coltrane saw the potential in his character right away. In an interview for the franchise's 20th-anniversary special, the actor compared Hagrid to Superman.""Everybody in the world would like a really big, huge, strong, good man on their side, simple as that. That's the attraction of Superman and these things,"" he said. ""You wish there were a power for good in the world that was irresistible to the bad guys. And Hagrid was always obviously the good guy, wasn't he?""An emotional Coltrane also said in that special, ""The legacy of the movies is that my children's generation will show them to their children. So, you could be watching it in 50 years' time, easy. I'll not be here, sadly, but Hagrid will, yes.""Even though Coltrane is no more, his iconic role of Hagrid will live on in the films. Even those who read the book, and have also seen the films, will usually visualise the Scottish actor when thinking about the gentle giant.",2022-10-16

/opinion/views/news/why-are-political-parties-trying-woo-the-prince-calcutta-3144191,Why are political parties trying to woo the Prince of Calcutta?,"When former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly exits as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) after a three-year tenure leaving behind a mixed track record, the last thing one should expect is that he will cease to be in media focus. No. That is just not going to happen. And Sourav himself has made that amply clear.Between October 13 and 15, the 50-year-old former cricketer made two remarks which are a clear pointer to his future plans. First, he said not remaining BCCI chief is not the end of the road for him and secondly, he said he would contest for the post of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president. As BCCI president, he had the entire country's cricket administration and interaction with international cricket organisations as his mandate. As CAB president, his area of activities will be much smaller but familiar because he had held that post for four years earlier.Sourav's stints as cricket administrator in Bengal and BCCI have ensured he remains in the media focus and consequently the public domain. And controversies and media speculations have only added spices to that. The media in India has come up with all sorts of theories without any authenticity as it groped in the dark to understand why Sourav did not get an extension as BCCI chief. But none asked the question: is there a sense of entitlement in either getting or not getting an extension?Sourav's stint as an administrator has had its own share of setbacks – uncertainty over the Indian Premier League (IPL) due to Covid-19, lack of firming up of India's domestic cricket structure and departure of a few sulking players from Bengal to other states including wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha looking for greener pastures.On and off the field, Sourav always had a set of admirers as a player and cricket administrator. But as an administrator, he also has his critics. Some of his former colleagues in the national team rate him highly for grooming and backing them to the hilt even in the toughest phases of their cricketing careers.In normal course, Sourav's exit would have passed off as a routine event. But what has made it non-routine is the questions why he did not get a second shot as BCCI president after his first tenure came to an end even though there was no legal bar. What had raised the expectations of Sourav supporters was that in September this year, the Supreme Court allowed a person to have two consecutive tenures as president and secretary, overturning to a considerable extent the 2018 recommendations of a judicial commission. Ironically, many had thought the apex court ruling would facilitate a fresh stint of Sourav as BCCI president.The question agitating a section of the pro-Sourav media as well as the public is while he did not get an extension, BCCI Secretary Jay Shah, son of senior BJP leader and Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, got it. The comparison would not have found traction had it been anyone other than Jay. This has not only polarised the Indian media but also entered the political minefield in West Bengal where the BJP has been accused by ruling Trinamool Congress and opposition Congress and CPI(M) of ""humiliating"" the popular ""Prince of Calcutta"". The common refrain of TMC, Congress and CPI(M) is that the BJP is cut up with Sourav after failing to make him join the saffron party. TMC spokesman Kunal Ghosh claimed that it is an example of ""political vendetta"" that Amit Shah's son would continue as BCCI secretary, but not Sourav as its president.However, Ghosh was evasive when asked about his comments on Sourav hosting Amit Shah and other BJP leaders to a dinner at his south Kolkata residence in May this year. That event had no doubt left TMC squirming for a response.Sourav, for his part, has so far done a delicate balancing act when it comes to politics. If he hosted Shah to a dinner, the very next day he also shared dais with TMC leaders, including Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Mayor Firhad Hakim, at separate public events. He has so far refrained from joining any political party. Now that he is going to be out of the BCCI, will he exercise his political options? When Sourav had become CAB president for the first time in September 2015 following the death of Jagmohan Dalmiya, it was thought he had the backing of Mamata who however went on record to reject any suggestion of interference in a sporting body. It remains to be seen how the coming CAB presidential race pans out.The question is: why would political parties fall over each other to woo Sourav who has no standing as a political heavyweight and is not known for articulation or giving fiery speeches. Given his popularity as a cricketer, Sourav's only value addition could be to the electoral plank of Bengali sub-nationalism which TMC had used so successfully in 2021. It is a different matter that TMC had later tried to live down a bit of that sub-nationalism post-Bengal assembly poll by inducting a number of non-Bengali politicians from other states as it had unsuccessfully tried to be a national party by contesting assembly elections in Goa, and prior to that, in Tripura municipal polls. It certainly did not help TMC which put up a disastrous show in Goa and Tripura.True, Mamata herself is TMC's biggest vote-catcher in Bengal. But the party has built up a formidable grassroot machinery and mobilisation across the state, which BJP cannot match. On the other hand, BJP's main electoral mascot is Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is in this perspective that one has to see Sourav's relevance in Bengal politics and how much value addition he can bring to any party he decides to join. For BJP, the induction of Sourav cannot make up for its lack of adequate ground-level presence in Bengal to counter TMC. Sourav must carefully assess his political relevance, if any.Pallab Bhattacharya is a special correspondent for The Daily Star. He writes from New Delhi, India.",2022-10-16
/opinion/views/news/the-ecs-main-job-conduct-elections-not-suspend-them-3144266,"The EC’s main job is to conduct elections, not suspend them","For its latest feat, our Election Commission (EC) deserves to be commended on a number of counts. First, for perhaps the first time in Bangladesh's history, the EC stepped up and halted the by-election to Gaibandha-5 constituency amid widespread irregularities. Second, the commission seems to have finally realised its constitutional obligation of ensuring free and fair elections. Finally, it has also exercised its power – power to suspend an ongoing election, to dismiss the results of an election, and to decide that a re-election is required.The EC has provided its justification for why the Gaibandha-5 by-poll was suspended, while the ruling party claims that the EC is biased and that the election was conducted in a free and fair manner.The EC has, in the past, always been indifferent to accusations of electoral irregularities and has always declared elections to have been conducted fairly. However, this time around, the commission has been curiously diligent about ensuring that all polling stations are monitored via CCTV cameras. Whether there are any connections between the EC's determination to prove it is going to ensure corruption-free elections and the ruling party's vehemence in proving the EC is partial against them remains to be seen.However, conversations over the last few days have given way to some crucial questions. Why is the EC so hell-bent on trying to convince us that election irregularities only occur due to law enforcers not fulfilling their duty, while also trying to establish the ""legitimacy"" of electronic voting machines (EVMs)? Why are CCTV cameras being posed as the only solution to ensuring free and fair elections?One of the main reasons for a lack of public trust towards the EC is how adamant the commission has been about using EVMs in elections. It was in late August that the EC declared its decision to use EVMs in up to 150 parliamentary seats in the next general election. And this was done despite major opposition political parties' clear expression of distrust towards the voting machines. It has been widely discussed by opposition party politicians, political experts, and members of the public how fickle a machine an EVM is and how it can easily be manipulated by the EC itself and by those whom the commission has recruited to oversee polling stations. But the EC has paid no heed to these concerns. It has, in turn, only said that EVMs cannot be manipulated by any ""outside"" entities. But the concern that EVMs could be manipulated by presiding officers (PO), besides the fact that the machines are also prone to not recognising the biometric fingerprints of voters, have consistently been dismissed by the EC. Who is to say that the PO who can unlock an EVM using their fingerprint cannot also manipulate the votes? Moreover, there is no Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) when it comes to EVMs. And even if the voting is done digitally, the votes across polling stations and centres will still be accumulated manually.Instead of constructively addressing each of these concerns, the EC has decided to create an ""invisible,"" outside enemy when it is the commission itself whose role in the use of EVMs the people are worried about.The events of the Gaibandha-5 by-poll carry some lessons for us all. This was only a by-poll, wherein a transfer of power is not much of an issue. But even here, a section of people belonging to the ruling party have tried to manipulate the results of the election, even going so far as entering voting booths. So what happens in a year or so, when the parliamentary election will be held, and there will be 300 constituencies across the country to keep safe from such influence and manipulation? Given that it would be the biggest-scale election the country would have, it is only realistic to expect attempts of tampering with its outcome. How will the EC prevent this from happening? Is it trying to imply that it can prevent irregularities by simply installing thousands of CCTV cameras across all the booths in the country? Will they be diligently monitoring all those thousands of voting booths at all times? Is this not highly unrealistic?Bangladesh has so far had 11 general elections, four of which were conducted under an impartial caretaker government and were also largely acceptable to observers here and abroad. And the parties elected during those four elections were also ousted. The remaining seven elections were conducted under ruling parties, two of which were one-sided. Those two cannot really be considered elections at all. An election can never be without contest or competition. The rest of the five elections did not see the existing ruling party be ousted from power and were therefore wrapped in controversy.The Gaibandha-5 by-poll is no outlier, as our own election history tells us that elections conducted under ruling parties can never be free and fair, and are always met with scrutiny.In order to make the next general election an acceptable one, the EC must evolve beyond the use of CCTV cameras. It must be acknowledged that EVMs can be tampered with by those overseeing the polling centres themselves.While it would be difficult for the Election Commission to fulfil its constitutional mandate of ensuring impartial elections, it must exercise its power to suspend elections mired in controversy due to corrupt law enforcers and administrative workers. Now is the time for the EC to emphasise for all parties, especially the ruling party, to help it to conduct free and fair elections. Whether the EC can duly punish the law enforcers, influentials, and other workers who caused irregularities during the Gaibandha-5 by-poll will serve as a crucial test for them.Transcribed and translated by Afia Jahin.

Rifat died at Barishal Medical College Hospital later that day.A video clip of the barbaric attack, believed to be captured on a mobile phone, went viral on social media and triggered public outrage, with many condemning bystanders for not coming forward to save Rifat.Minni, who was seen in the video clip screaming while desperately trying to stop the two men from attacking her husband with sharp weapons, was made the first witness in the case.Citing the bail petition of Minni, her lawyer Jamiul Hoque Faisal told The Daily Star that they have examined the trial court verdict of Rifat Sharif murder case and found that there are some errors in the verdict.The HC is yet to fix any date for hearing the bail petition, he added.    On November 4, 2020, the HC admitted for hearing the appeal filed by Ayesha Siddika Minni challenging the Barguna court verdict that convicted and sentenced her to death in the sensational murder case.The HC also stayed the trial court order that fined her Tk 50,000 in the case.A Barguna court on September 30, 2020 sentenced six people including Minni to death in Rifat Sharif murder case. ",2022-10-16

/opinion/views/news/can-indias-oldest-party-reinvent-itself-3144236,Can India’s Oldest Party Reinvent Itself?,"This month, for the first time in nearly 25 years, the Indian National Congress, India's main opposition party, will elect a president who is not a member of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The family, whose history is inextricably linked to India's ""grand old party,"" has decided not to enter the leadership race, thus providing Congress a unique opportunity to revitalise itself ahead of the crucial 2024 general election.I am one of the two candidates, along with Congress veteran Mallikarjun Kharge.The Nehru-Gandhi family's decision to step aside, together with the potential implications for the 2024 election, has revived public interest in Congress. It has also provided a welcome distraction from the party's infighting and latest electoral defeats. As the 9,000 party delegates cast their ballots, former Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is leading marches from Kanyakumari to Kashmir as part of the party's 150-day ""national unity march"" (Bharat Jodo Yatra).The 136-year-old Congress has a storied history, but it finds itself at a crossroads following several successive election defeats at the national and state levels. True, the party has bounced back from similar setbacks, such as the electoral routs of 1977, 1989, and 1996. The tragic assassinations of leaders Indira Gandhi in 1984 and Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 were immediately followed by general-election victories. But the 2019 general election loss and Rahul Gandhi's subsequent resignation as party president have resulted in a three-year-long leadership crisis.How can Congress overcome its current challenges? In addition to electing a new president, it should hold elections for the Congress Working Committee, the party's principal executive body. Allowing the party's rank-and-file members to choose who will lead this powerful body would help legitimise the party's incoming leaders, giving them a clear mandate for a much-needed renewal.A new leadership would also galvanise voters. After the members of the UK Conservative Party picked Boris Johnson to succeed Theresa May as party leader and prime minister in 2019, for example, the Tories won their biggest parliamentary majority since 1987.Whatever the outcome of the current contest for Congress leadership, I believe it can revive the party and contribute to the defence of Indian democracy. While the party's presidential election is an internal exercise, it also offers Congress a chance to energise its political base and generate wider public interest.The Gandhi family's decision to step aside is the key to this potential renewal. Two candidates putting forward their visions for the party and the nation, and submitting themselves to a democratic vote, ends the talk of ""dynasty politics."" Moreover, it highlights the fact that no other Indian political party has a comparable process to determine its future leadership. By adhering to its constitution, Congress may inspire other political parties to step into the sunlight of internal democracy.But for Congress to return to power, the party's new elected leader will have to find a way to increase the party's appeal beyond its die-hard supporters. The party received only 19 percent of the vote in the 2014 and 2019 general elections, losing voters to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). To win them back, Congress requires youthful energy and fresh ideas that can challenge the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-chauvinist ideology. This requires a party leader who understands the aspirations of young Indians and firmly believes that Congress can put the country on a better path.To help India seize the opportunities the 21st century offers, Congress must articulate a positive and aspirational vision for the country's future. But first, it must fix the organisational and structural deficiencies that have impeded the party's recent election campaigns. Its next president must combine effective leadership with organisational reforms. Delegating powers to state leaders, for example, would free the new Congress leader from onerous administrative tasks and help create the strong local leadership that in previous decades undergirded the party's national appeal.None of this will be easy. But throughout its history, Congress has shown an immense capacity to weather changes and adapt to shifting political circumstances. The people of India are tired of the BJP's domineering and increasingly divisive governance style. To unite the country and reinvent itself, Congress must use the national unity march and the upcoming presidential election to position itself as a clear ideological alternative. India deserves no less. Shashi Tharoor, a former UN under-secretary-general, is an MP for the Indian National Congress.

/daily-star-books/news/hulus-rosaline-witty-predictable-parody-romeo-and-juliet-3145106,"Hulu’s ‘Rosaline’ is a witty, predictable parody of ‘Romeo and Juliet’ ","Romeo and Juliet (1597) remains to this day one of William Shakespeare's most well-known plays. Director Karen Maine's Rosaline, released on Hulu on October 14, 2022, offers new insight into the beloved tragedy by reimagining it as a romantic comedy. The movie tells the classic love story from the perspective of Juliet's cousin Rosaline (Kaitlyn Dever), who happens to be Romeo's recent ex-girlfriend. Crushed when Romeo (Kyle Allen) meets Juliet (Isabela Merced) and begins to pursue her, Rosaline schemes to foil the famous romance and reclaim her man.In the early years of the Renaissance, Italy was divided into several smaller city-states which often warred with one another. Rome was mostly in ruins—but Padua and Verona came under Venetian control, and cities like Florence and Milan flourished under early financial innovations spearheaded by the Medici clan of bankers and politicians. In the cities, politically powerful wealthy elites became patrons of the arts and a luxury class emerged quickly—but social inequality throughout the majority of the country was profound, and most of Italy belonged to the peasant class. Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, but the play knowingly wags its finger at the warring Capulets and Montagues, wealthy families who can't look past their own insularity and haughty self-importance to be good to one another, or to allow their children the chance at real love. Shakespeare drew on many poems, novels, and myths in the construction of Romeo and Juliet, but it also may very well have been a critique of Renaissance-era social inequality and the trivial concerns of the upwardly mobile elite. In the world of Romeo and Juliet, love is connected through word and action with violence, and Romeo and Juliet's deepest mutual expression of love occurs through their suicides. By connecting love with pain and ultimately with death, Shakespeare suggests that there is an inherent sense of violence in many of the physical and emotional facets of expressing love. In addition to being based on Shakespeare's original tale, Rosaline is also inspired by Rebecca Serle's 2012 novel When You Were Mine, which updates Romeo and Juliet to modern times in Southern California—with the inclusion of Rosaline as a main character. This leads to plenty of intentionally anachronistic choices, such as having Paris (Spencer Stevenson) talk about how Romeo is a ""tasty Montague,"" or including  a cover of Robyn's ""Dancing on My Own"". Incorporating modernity into a known piece of classic literature is not new territory at this point, but Rosaline has some amusing takes on the enduring love story. The movie takes the plot back to the past in Verona, with characters in period clothing. However, it throws out most of the Shakespearean language in hopes of reminding us that Romeo and Juliet at its heart is more accessible and hip than its old-fashioned text. The movie's take on love is far more light-hearted than that of the original tale. Romeo love bombs his way into Rosaline's affections, mostly by speaking in verse. He is a foolish and an impulsive romantic with a poor emotional attention span. Rosaline, comparatively, is an overthinking realist. She is especially entertaining when she playfully calls out the patriarchy of the Renaissance era—a time when she'd be nearly too old to marry and is looked down upon for speaking at the table or aspiring to be a cartographer. ""While you are off writing verse, I am off changing diapers?"" she asks Romeo, establishing her strong character. 
Yet, when Romeo starts pursuing Juliet, Rosaline spends most of her time trying to get him back, which involves sabotaging her sweet and trusting cousin and brushing off the advances of Dario (Sean Teale), a well-mannered soldier and potential suitor. In this light, the movie offers a fresh take, as Rosaline is the kind of underdog character we are curious to see move from the background to centre stage from the start.

While Rosaline starts out wanting to marry for love and be an independent woman in an era where such a thing was unheard of, the chemistry between her and Dario provides each of the two headstrong characters an equal opponent to face off with. The movie is surprisingly non-committal about whether their relationship is going to be forever or just for right now, which feels appropriate for them both. While Rosaline appreciates Romeo and Juliet's romance, she comments on the plot holes, the bizarre timing of events, and of course, the careless plan the star-crossed lovers come up with. That is what makes Rosaline work, though. It takes the premise of the famous play, and holds it up as the lofty idea that it is. Stripped of their romantic grandeur, Romeo and Juliet are kids who barely know each other and enact a convoluted, dangerous plan to be together. The movie is for anyone who loves to make fun of Romeo and Juliet just as much as they also love a love story.
It simultaneously points out the ridiculousness of Romeo and Juliet's situation, while not discrediting love as a concept. 








Of diverse princesses and demigods: Is racebending in fantasy adaptations enough? Read more
Fascinatingly, the film is the most enjoyable when Rosaline and Juliet team up, like when they pick up local men at a pub. It is, thus, frustrating to watch the two main female characters pitted against each other in a fight for a man who really is not worth the effort. This story element is at odds with the empowering tone the filmmakers were clearly aiming for. 
Nevertheless, the movie successfully demonstrates that although Rosaline initially takes her cousin under her wing as a means of getting her to break up with Romeo, the two develop a bond that leads Rosaline to feel guilty about her deceit. To be honest, I was more invested in the burgeoning friendship between the girls than I was in either of their romantic relationships. Most of the plot is also quite predictable, and the movie's hit-or-miss tone offers a way heavier dose of parody than heart.
Nitpicks and disappointments aside, Rosaline ultimately makes a case for telling the lost stories of characters that never got their due. A witty reimagining, it offers an entertaining riff on Shakespeare for both current teens and those who were that age in the 1990s.

US West Texas Intermediate crude was at $85.67 a barrel, up 6 cents, or 0.1 per cent, after a 7.6 per cent decline last week.China's central bank rolled over maturing medium-term policy loans on Monday while keeping the interest rate unchanged for a second month, in a signal that the central bank would continue to maintain loose monetary policy.Beijing would also greatly increase domestic energy supply capacity and step up risk controls in key commodities including coal, oil and gas, and electricity, a senior National Energy Administration official said on Monday.China will further increase reserve capacities for key commodities, another state official told a news conference in Beijing.Oil found support from a combination of factors, including Chinese President Xi Jinping's comments at the Party Congress that reassured accommodative policies for the economy, a positive sign for demand outlook, CMC Markets analyst Tina Teng said.China is expected to release trade and economic data this week, with third-quarter GDP growth possibly set to rebound from the previous quarter, but 2022 threatening to be China's worst performing year in almost half a century.Meanwhile, a strong US dollar and further interest rate increases from the US Federal Reserve limit price gains.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Friday inflation had become ""pernicious"" and difficult to arrest, and warranted continued ""frontloading"" through larger rate increases of three-quarters of a percentage point.Inflation in the United States remains stubborn and growth in European Union countries is due to weaken to half a percent, Gita Gopinath, a senior official at the International Monetary Fund said on Monday.Oil supply is due to remain tight after OPEC and allies like Russia pledged on Oct. 5 to cut output by 2 million barrels per day, as a war of words between OPEC's de facto leader Saudi Arabia and the United States could foreshadow more volatility.",2022-10-17

/opinion/editorial/news/no-breathing-space-the-poor-3144771,No breathing space for the poor,"Whoever said that poverty is ""violence with tacit consent"" couldn't be truer at the moment. And this violence – in the form of relentless assaults on the wallets of the poor – seems to be getting out of control in Bangladesh. According to a survey of the World Food Programme, 68 percent of the people are struggling to buy food. The sky-high prices of food – which 88 percent of the surveyed identified as a major challenge – are getting harder to deal with: 64 percent said they took loan, and 29 percent of families said they used their savings, to buy food in August.Evidently, things have reached a point where the extremely high living cost has created a dystopian reality for the ordinary people.  For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Evidently, things have reached a point where the extremely high living cost has created a dystopian reality for the ordinary people. With food and non-food inflation hovering near double digits, the poor could really use some breathing space. High inflation, according to experts, is affecting people's purchasing capacity, and thereby compromising their health and future. As revealed by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, food inflation reached 9.08 percent in September, after hitting 9.94 percent in August – the highest since FY 2012-13. Meanwhile, non-food inflation reached 9.13 percent in September. How will the poor survive in such a situation?They are being forced to spend less and less on food, as they can't cut spending on rent, utilities, healthcare and transportation, the costs of which have also jumped. While talking to this newspaper, some people described how they are struggling to pay for even the most basic food items. Rice, for example, is being sold at nearly record high prices. Prices of wheat, the second most consumed cereal in Bangladesh, reached ""new record levels in September, over 70 percent above their year-earlier levels"", according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The prices of most vegetables also remain generally high, while eggs, once considered a low-cost source of protein for the poor, are now out of reach for many.The government is apparently leaving no stone unturned to control the situation. For example, to increase the supply of rice and contain its prices, it has reduced import tariff and gave permission to 320 private firms to import 13.4 lakh tonnes of rice. The food directorate also signed contracts with India, Vietnam, Myanmar and Thailand to import 530,000 tonnes of rice under government-to-government arrangement. But continued inflation, unfriendly weather affecting domestic rice production, and the Russia-Ukraine war are proving to be too potent a combination to be contained with such measures. These are taking away for food gains made by Bangladesh.Evidently, things have reached a point where the extremely high living cost has created a dystopian reality for the ordinary people. While increasing food supply through ramped-up production and import is a priority, it is equally important to bring food prices within reach through greater market interventions. Also, as experts have suggested, it is important that the government creates a national relief fund, instead of separate food programmes and project-based initiatives, to provide long-term food assistance to low-income groups. True, some impediments like the Russia-Ukraine war and erratic weather will remain indefinitely. But their consequences can be minimised through implementing proper policies.",2022-10-17

An anti-aircraft rocket could be seen streaking into the morning sky, followed by an explosion and orange flames, as residents raced for shelter.A pregnant woman was among three people killed in the attack on the residential building, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Ukraine's Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi said there had been deaths in other cities but did not give a full toll.Black smoke poured out of the windows of the Kyiv apartment building and emergency service workers toiled to douse flames.""I have never been so afraid... It is murder, it is simply murder, there are no other words for it,"" said Vitalii Dushevskiy, 29, a food delivery courier who rents an apartment in the blasted building.His flatmate, who gave his name only as Nazar, said they had tried to leave their flat only to find the staircase ""all gone"".Nearby, Elena Mazur, 52, was searching for her mother, who had managed to call her to say she was buried under rubble.""She is not picking up the phone,"" Mazur said, hoping she had been rescued and taken to hospital.Ukraine said the attacks were carried out by Iran-made 'suicide drones', which fly to their target and detonate. Russia's defence ministry said it had carried out a ""massive"" attack on military targets and energy infrastructure across Ukraine using high-precision weapons.""All night and all morning the enemy terrorizes the civilian population. Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app.""The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us.

There was no immediate comment from Kyiv, which typically does not comment on incidents in Russia.Elsewhere on Monday, renewed Russian shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe's largest, caused it to be disconnected again from Ukraine's power grid, Ukrainian state energy firm Energoatom said.The plant, which has often been shelled during the war, is occupied by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff.""Such nuclear blackmail of a terrorist country should not go unanswered by the world community! Ukraine needs protection of the sky above its energy facilities!""

A new set of players are on the running to win the prestigious award this time.The Ballon D'Or is selected by a jury made of journalists from various nations who are instructed by France Football to judge players based on their individual performance, team performance and fair play.Mohamed Salah's PFA Player of the Year winning performance, golden boot winning campaign from likes of Mbappe and Lewandowski, Kevin De Bruyne's all-round performance that brought Manchester City the league title were all in the discussion about who should win the award.However, the one who seems to be on the verge of winning the award this time is the Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema. Various news portals are already claiming that he has been decided as the winner.The award is intended to be given to the best performer in a particular season. This is not decided by only looking at the statistics of a player. Performance in big games, impact in team's success also matter along with individual player's statistics.In this case, what gives Benzema the edge over others is that not only was he the top scorer in both La Liga (27 goals) and UEFA Champions League (15 goals), his contribution led to his team winning both the competition, making his performance the most impactful.There are often disagreements on who should be the winner between fans and pundits. But considering the trophies won, impact made for the team's success and the individual statistics, Karim Benzema should be winning the coveted Ballon D'Or this year unless something unexpected takes place.Tamjidul Hoque likes to talk about football and checks his emails from time to time, you can contact him at tamjidulh@gmail.comREFERENCES1. si.com (march 11,2022).

/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/russia-launches-major-attack-ukrainian-infrastructure-3-killed-3145081,"Russia launches major attack on Ukrainian infrastructure, 3 killed","Waves of explosive-laden suicide drones struck Ukraine's capital Monday, setting buildings ablaze and sending people scurrying for shelter or attempting to shoot down the kamikazes — a week after Russia unleashed its most widespread strikes against the country in months.Air attacks in central Kyiv had become a rarity in recent months, and the concentrated use of drones, their blasts echoing across the city, sowed terror and frayed nerves. One of the drones slammed into a residential building, killing three people, said the deputy head of the president's office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko. Energy facilities were also among the targets.Drones used in the attack appeared to include Iranian-made Shaheds. Previous Russian airstrikes on Kyiv were mostly with missiles. Intense, sustained bursts of gunfire rang out Monday as the drones hummed overhead, apparently soldiers trying to shoot them down. Others headed for shelter — though city life quickly resumed in a country that has become grimly accustomed to attacks.In what many fear could become more common occurrences in urban centers nearly eight months into the war, the barrage came in successive waves of 28 drones, Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Five of them plunged into Kyiv itself, said Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.In the Kyiv region, 13 or more were shot down, all of them as they flew in from the south, said a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yurii Ihnat.One strike appeared to target the city's heating network, hitting an operations center. Another slammed into a four-story residential building, ripping a large hole in it and collapsing at least three apartments on top of each other. In addition to the three people killed there, Tymoshenko said 19 were rescued from the rubble, four of them wounded. Rescue workers searching for victims scrambled over the debris from which gray smoke billowed.An Associated Press photographer who was out shooting morning scenes of Kyiv caught one of the drones on camera, its triangle-shaped wing and pointed warhead clearly visible against the blue sky.""The whole night, and the whole morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post. ""Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine.""""The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us,"" he wrote.The Iranian-made Shaheds, which Russia has rebranded as Geran-2 drones, pack an explosive charge and can linger over targets before nosediving into them. They can be fired one after the other.Andrii Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, confirmed in a social media post that Shahed drones were among those used in the strike. Iran has previously denied providing Russia with weapons, although its Revolutionary Guard chief has boasted about providing arms to the world's top powers, without elaborating.The drones have also been repeatedly used by Russia elsewhere in Ukraine in recent weeks to target urban centers and infrastructure, including power stations. They are comparatively cheap, costing in the region of US$20,000.Their use in swarms presents a challenge to Ukrainian air defenses, said Ihnat, the Air Force spokesman. Western nations have promised to bolster Ukrainian air defenses with systems that can shoot down drones but much of that weaponry has yet to arrive and, in some cases, may be months away.""The challenges are serious because the air defense forces and means are the same as they were at the beginning of the war,"" Ihnat said. Some air defense weaponry supplied by Western nations can only be used during daylight hours when targets are visible, he added.After months during which strikes in central Kyiv were rare, early morning strikes last week put Kyiv as well as the rest of the country back on edge.Russian President Vladimir Putin said those strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of a bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland. Putin blames Ukraine for masterminding the blast, which suspended traffic over the bridge and curtailed Moscow's ability to supply Russian troops in the occupied regions of southern Ukraine.The strike on Kyiv comes as fighting has intensified in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, as well as the continued Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Zelenskyy said in his Sunday evening address that there was heavy fighting around the cities of Bakhmut and Soledar in the Donetsk region.The Donetsk and Luhansk regions make up the industrial east known as the Donbas, and were two of four regions annexed by Russia in September in defiance of international law.On Sunday, the Russian-backed regime in the Donetsk region said Ukraine had shelled its central administrative building in a direct hit. No casualties were reported.",2022-10-17

I am still in South Korea, at the after-party of the event. It has been exhilarating, to say the least. In 2019, I was a participant in the same event, and now I took the judge's seat – it is truly and honour. It is also very heartening to see the Bangladeshi contingent perform well here.
Who, among the Bangladeshi participants, did well?



Mir Maryam Ahmed reached the Top 10 of the 'Face of Asia' segment. Besides her, Hasnat Jami was also noticeable in the event.
Where is does the modeling industry in Bangladesh stand right now?
Despite our greatest efforts, there is a lot left to be desired in terms of events. For example, we used to have the Bangladesh Fashion week, which does not take place any more. Whatever achievements that we have in this field, it is the result of earnest efforts from a very limited number of people in this sector.



 








On that note, I would really like to thank Azra Mahmood for her constant mentorship and support for this programme.
You have achieved a lot at this young age. Do you feel like you could mentor some up-and-coming models in the future?
I cannot even think about mentoring someone, as so many seniors whom I idolize are still in their prime. I just mentioned Azra Mahmood, and there are many other talented individuals, who deserve the title of a 'mentor'. I am just happy to be able to represent Bangladesh.

Even though Ayub Bachchu had a legendary career with both LRB and as a solo artiste, he continued his never-ending journey towards making even more memorable classics.In June of 2018, The Daily Star sat down with the legendary Ayub Bachchu for what would be one of his last full-length interviews.It seems like you have added a new guitar to your already majestic collection. Tell us about it.I was just practicing with this one; it is a 'Rusty Cooley' signature guitar from Dean. Rusty Cooley is a guitarist I have grown to admire a lot in recent years. His technique is immaculate, and he is one of the fastest shredders in the world today.  Every guitar I own is like a friend of mine, and they listen to what I want to articulate through my tunes.Do you listen to music from the newer bands in the industry?
Of course. I think the kids are doing some amazing work, and I love all of them. I will not take any particular names of musicians that I like, because that will be unfair to the others who are doing so well. They will go very far if they stay humble and passionate towards their craft.
Could you tell us about some of the new music you are working on at the moment?
I will be doing some new songs that will connect to the audience like none before them. The songs will bring back the feelings one could perhaps derive from ""Cholo Bodley Jai"" or ""Keu Shukhi Noy"". I am never the one to think that I have done enough, because I know that a musician's journey is endless. And from my side, the best is yet to come.



A lot of people have complained that the access to the internet and social media has made a negative impact on music as a whole, due to the 'viral' culture that has emerged. What are your thoughts on this?
Before putting the blame on something or someone, we have to look at what we ourselves are doing. The industry will always keep changing, we have to accept that and adapt to it. When you walked in to take this interview, you saw that I was practicing music, and getting ready for the next show. A musician should not think about what is going on around him; he should just be true to himself and keep on making music that he likes. In fact, I will request all the bands in the country to never stop believing in yourself, your day will come.

Do you have any message for your fans?
I want to request everyone to have respect for all artistes. Never share negativity regarding a particular musician or genre even if you do not like them. We badly need unity in the industry, and mutual respect is important not only among musicians, but their followers as well.
Of course. I think the kids are doing some amazing work, and I love all of them. I will not take any particular names of musicians that I like, because that will be unfair to the others who are doing so well. They will go very far if they stay humble and passionate towards their craft.Could you tell us about some of the new music you are working on at the moment?I will be doing some new songs that will connect to the audience like none before them. The songs will bring back the feelings one could perhaps derive from ""Cholo Bodley Jai"" or ""Keu Shukhi Noy"". I am never the one to think that I have done enough, because I know that a musician's journey is endless. And from my side, the best is yet to come.A lot of people have complained that the access to the internet and social media has made a negative impact on music as a whole, due to the 'viral' culture that has emerged.

The talented actor is currently busy promoting Raihan Rafi's football-based film, ""Damal"", which will hit theatres on October 28.The audience will once again get the chance to witness Razz's crackling chemistry alongside Bidya Sinha Mim, in this film. ""Damal"" also stars Siam Ahmed, Rashed Mamun Apu, and Sumit, among many others.In a candid conversation with The Daily Star, Sariful Razz opened up about his love for football, his role in ""Damal"" and much more.It seems like football has truly become your trusty 'best friend'.  We don't see you anywhere without your football nowadays.
Honestly speaking, I don't go anywhere without my trusty football. My whole life revolves around it now, and I am always taking pictures with it.



Which international football team do you support?
I am a huge fan of Brazil and my all-time favourite player is Ronaldinho
How did you perform the iconic 'bicycle kick' in ""Damal""?



 








I had zero knowledge about how to do a bicycle kick. Thus, when the director told me that I had to perform the bicycle kick in a scene, I had major doubts about whether I would be able to execute it to perfection. I spent 3-4 months getting into the skin of my character in the film. So, I tried my best to make sure that scene was perfect, and I am really pleased with how it was shown in the trailer. The cinematographer truly captured the scene brilliantly in the film.
In the film, it feels as if football is more important than your wife? Why did it look like your wife was angry at you?

Unfortunately, in the film, my wedding date and football match fell on the same day. Time was ticking and the Kazi was taking a lot of time. So, I had to stop him in the middle by shouting 'Alhamdulillah Kobul', before running off towards the field. When I returned after the match, my wife had locked the door and refused to let me enter. To know what happens next, the audiences will have to wait till October 28.

""Damal"" is inspired by the Shadhin Bangla Football Team, which was formed in 1971 during the Liberation War. In the movie, I play the captain of that team. When they go to the theatres, the audience will get to see my love for football in this film.
Both your films, ""Hawa"" and ""Poran"", are still playing in theatres. ""Damal"" will also be released soon. What are your expectations from this upcoming film?
I am really happy that both my movies ""Poran"" and ""Hawa"" are doing exceptionally well at theatres. ""Damal"" will also be released next week and thus I am hopeful that the audience will shower their love on this movie as well.

However, it has been learned that the amount is 86 thousand US dollars.Replying to a query from The Daily Star, Day said, ""Yes, BFF will have to pay as FIFA have awarded me the payment but there isn't much to say on it just yet.""Previously in 2016, FIFA had before instructed the BFF to clear the due wages of sacked Dutch coach Rene Koster, which amounted to 80 thousand euros, including the interest accrued over the unpaid period. Back then, the BFF was also ordered to pay 8000 Swiss francs to FIFA and Koster as proceedings of the case. Ultimately, the BFF took more than a year to transfer payments to the Dutch coach.Meanwhile, in a video statement, BFF general secretary Abu Nayeem Shohag said today, ""Former coach Jamie Day appealed to FIFA about his unpaid wages and FIFA has asked us to give away the compensation to Jamie. Our legal department is now working on it to appeal the matter to FIFA.""Day further informed that he had been in constant touch with the BFF to recover his unpaid wages, as per his contract.

/shout/news/has-the-medias-obsession-shakib-khan-gone-too-far-3147066,Has the media's obsession with Shakib Khan gone too far?,"Some psychologists suggest that gossip is the ""glue that binds social groups together"".While we can justify our unquenchable thirst to absorb and distribute personal, and often clandestine, information about celebrities using psychology, the same cannot be said for media organisations that impede into the personal lives of celebrities to provide coverage.Recently, there has been a surge in coverage of the actor Shakib Khan and his relationship with film actress and news anchor Shobnom Bubly. Many of the articles published cover and extend on pre-existing rumors about their divorce, and speculations of their current relationship since they uploaded a picture of their two-year old son. However, the coverage went just beyond that. From probing into their personal lives, contacting close family members, to solidifying rumors about Shakib's involvement with other female co-stars, the media stopped at nothing to pump out content.This harms our community in a multitude of ways, the first one being the most obvious one: not doing justice to the right to privacy of these celebrities. It is already difficult for celebrities, wherever they may be from, to keep their lives under the wraps from the public. It's easy for us to forget that they are just like the rest of us, and have the same inalienable rights to privacy and non-disclosure as us.In this wild goose-chase of Shakib Khan's history and his past and present involvement with co-stars, the personal lives of female artists like Apu Biswas, Puja Chery, and Shabnom Bubly herself were put in jeopardy.As much as the audience should try to deter from being obsessed with canards and tell-tales, media organisations also have the unique responsibility of protecting the actors involved in the drama, not to mention the children of Shakib Khan as well. This forced limelight that children face due to the lottery of being born to celebrities is absolutely damaging to their childhood. The moral responsibility of sparing them the flashes of the paparazzi rests solely on the shoulders of these newspapers, TV channels and news portals, something that they do not seem to pay heed to.There exists a fine line between providing news reports on currently sought-after topics and being invasive. And in our information hungry delusions we often don't realise that the line we have crossed is miles behind us.I sympathise with those who have the job of providing coverage on celebrities and their lives, but that sympathy is valid only up to the point where they are not stepping on civil liberties or harming the readers in doing so. Just because a market for this content exists does not mean it is justified for publications to go absurd lengths to acquire information that they know the public will devour.As a general rule, I think it is okay to report on celebrities' personal lives as long as the information being published comes from those celebrities themselves and are consensually disclosed by them only, where they are aware of the exposure that they're subjecting themselves to. When it comes to children, media organisations must be proactive in taking responsibility even if their celebrity parents aren't aware of the dangers that come with having a limelight at infancy.Following the scandal around Shakib Khan's marriage, our feeds and front doors got saturated with articles that are basically gossip written in formal language. It's all invasive, not only are they stepping on the civil liberties of these celebrities, but invading the lives of the general public as well. After a point these articles get harder and harder to avoid. Algorithms work their magic by pushing juicy articles to the top and suppressing genuine and informative journalism. The more likes and shares articles about Shakib Khan get, the more incentive media houses have to uncover never-seen-before information, and this deprave cycle continues.Koushin Unber wishes to fast-track winter in Dhaka.

/daily-star-books/news/graphic-novel-the-push-and-pull-friendships-3146991,A graphic novel on the push and pull of friendships,"The last decade has seen the graphic novel take off in mainstream literary circles, moulding the depth of emotive storytelling with gorgeous, picturesque artwork. Most graphic novels, save a few such as Will Eisner's A Contract with God, have rarely been a collection of short stories. It's Not What You Thought It Would Be (Fantagraphics, 2021) is one such graphic novel saturated with a plethora of short stories around themes of friendship—the lost ones, the transitory ones, and the recovering ones—alongside ideas about the formation of the self. How does one navigate expectations, and accept the terms of a relationship between one's desires and needs? The author-illustrator, Lizzy Stewart, who teaches illustration at Goldsmiths College, conjures up a series of short, lively, and uniquely heartwarming stories that make it hard to believe that this is her debut collection. Stewart places her strong female characters and stories in a myriad of different settings which serve as the background to a flow of the conversations taking place. Intensely relatable as the reader flips the pages, the stories occur in places deeply etched into many of our memories—from rooftops to buses to benches in the park to the digital world of emails and texts.Nine incredibly jarring and vibrantly beautiful stories wrapped into one book. The stories take place in line with the ebb and flows of seeking different truths and understanding friendships and relationships with a heartfelt intensity. Each story has a unique setting to it. The first story, ""Heavy Air"", deals with a group of friends making a shelter for an injured fox in a neglected estate that ends up getting wrecked by a torrent of rainfall. ""Blush"" deals with the annals of growing up ""embarrassed to get anything right and equally embarrass[ed] to get anything wrong"", ending with the positive message of self-growth.""Dog Walk"" is an exciting story with two teenage girls frolicking from the park to a nearby roof, hoping to meet someone new and exciting. Interesting stories that harken to a time we have known and relished. ""Walking Home"" is a short story without any dialogue whatsoever; it leaves the sepia-minded artwork to do the talking in the reader's mind. ""Quiet"" is about a voice artist struggling to juggle her own needs versus the demands of her followers. ""Kindness is a noise. I wanted to make people hear kindness"", the artist says in the story. Perhaps the most heartfelt stories in the collection are ""A Quick Catch Up"" and ""The Wedding Guests"", which deal with placements and changing courses of friendship, from deep trust to the mundane to distant ones, portrayed through both in-person conversations and in digital settings. The dialogues are emotive, beguiling, and relatable. The artwork in each of the stories is relatable. Muted with shades of black, white, grey and blue—except the last story, which is filled with colours as the two characters chart their journey from dreamy childhood to the confusing phase of adulthood. The pages change from water colour images of nature and spaces to blue-ink drawn landscapes of various settings and the inhabitants in them. This is a soft, reflective collection of storytelling that touches your nerves gently, proving the tenacity and importance of friendships in our daily lives. In a banal life filled with anxieties, It's Not What You Thought It Would Be proves how, at the end of the day, we both constitute and make our own stories.Israr Hasan is a Senior Research Assistant at BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health.

The foreign ministry said it had no comment to offer.Journalists in Kashmir have long been under the close scrutiny of local and national authorities, who also strictly control access for foreign reporters who want to travel there.The Himalayan region is claimed in full by both India and neighbouring Pakistan, but both countries only control parts of it.Reuters said it had not been provided any reason for blocking Mattoo's travel.""We are disappointed that Sanna Irshad Mattoo, a contributor to Reuters, has not been allowed to travel to the United States to receive her Pulitzer Prize in New York alongside her peers.""""We have not been offered an official explanation as to why she has not been allowed to leave the country, but we believe that journalists should be able to travel freely,"" Reuters said in a statement.Mattoo had said in a tweet in July that immigration officials in New Delhi also had barred her from flying to France, where she was scheduled to attend a book launch and photography exhibition.In Mattoo's tweet on Tuesday she said that despite reaching out to several officials after the July incident, she had not received a response.",2022-10-19
/environment/news/dhaka-list-20-most-unsustainable-megacities-3146661,Dhaka in list of 20 most unsustainable megacities,"Dhaka is one of the 20 most unsustainable megacities in the world, as per a new climate report.The report titled, ""Ecological Threat Report (ETR)"", released Wednesday (October 19, 2022) found that South Asia is home to eight of the world's 20 most unsustainable megacities, with half of them in India alone.Produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), featuring exclusive research from the Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll, the Ecological Threat Report tracks the links between climate-change, ecological threats, and violent conflict or forced migration each year.Dhaka, Lahore, Kolkata, Delhi, Karachi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad are eight of the 20 cities facing the highest population growth and worst vulnerability to ecological threats.Bangladesh has seen 254 natural disasters respectively since 1981, according to the report.Many South Asian countries and cities exemplify the challenge of managing growing populations and ecological threats.For example, Dhaka, a city of 22.6 million people, is affected by ecological changes in several ways. It floods regularly, it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, and the city struggles to deal with waste, said the Ecological Threat Report.As per the report, Delhi suffered the highest air pollution of these cities. Air pollution was responsible for economic losses totalling USD 8.1 trillion, or 6.1 per cent of global economic output. While India is the world's third largest polluter, only 38.8% of its population consider climate change to be a serious threat.At least 56% countries and territories (127 out of 228) monitored by the ETR are facing catastrophic ecological threats. Europe is predicted to see high levels of water stress over next 20 years, with increased water stress predicted in Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Portugal and the Netherlands, amongst others.The countries most vulnerable to ecological threat are clustered in the three least peaceful regions: sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East & North Africa (MENA), and South Asia.In 2021, almost 92% of the world's undernourished people lived in low to very low peace countries, said the report. Megacities in low peace countries, like Kinshasa and Nairobi, have the highest population growth rates, low coping capacities, and will struggle to manage ecological threats. The world's 40 least peaceful countries will increase their population by 1.3 billion by 2050, representing 49% of the world's population.Forty-one countries are currently facing severe food insecurity, impacting economic development, public health, and social harmony, with 830 million people at risk, with 89% residing in sub-Saharan-Africa, followed by MENA with 49 million. Food insecurity is connected to water stress, defined as ""when more than 20% of the population do not have access to clean drinking water"".At least 23 out of 27 hotspot countries facing climate catastrophes with extremely low societal resilience are clustered in sub-Saharan Africa, said the report.The report's main overall finding is that the degradation of resources leads to violence and violence leads to the degradation of resources, according to the press release.",2022-10-19

Hence, there is no alternative to SME development to keep the economic pace afloat, the FBCCI president added.He also urged the banks to come forward to disburse more loans to SMEs.He also recommended implementing a ""one district, one product"" campaign and developing clusters based on raw materials available in the districts.Senior Adviser of the Foundation of MSME Cluster (FMC) in India Dr Tamal Sarkar came up with a power point presentation highlighting the development of Indian SMEs.Echoing the event's Bangladeshi speakers, he said both India and Bangladesh share the common nature of SMEs, market demand and culture as well.Therefore, Indian experience may appear to be effective to improve the Bangladeshi SME scenario.Former general manager of Small Industry Development Bank of India (SIDBL) and FMC India's consultant Surendra Srivastava and CII director Amit Kumar also spoke at the meeting.FBCCI Senior Vice President Mostofa Azad Chowdhury Babu, Vice-Presidents Md Amin Helaly, Md Habib Ullah Dawn, Directors and Secretary General Mohammad Mahfuzul Hoque were also present in the meeting.",2022-10-19

/life-living/travel/news/top-5-places-visit-sitakunda-3146841,Top 5 places to visit in Sitakunda ,"Well known for its natural beauty, Sitakunda has always been one of the major tourist spots in Bangladesh. Sitakunda is an upazila in Chattogram district hosting the first eco-park of the country. The name of the place itself — Sitakunda is rather intriguing and there are multiple myths behind the origin of the name, but that's another story!
For now, let's discuss the top 5 places you should visit if you are in Sitakunda.  Arguably the most popular place in Sitakunda and had to be number one on the list, Chandranath Hill is well known for its verdant and scenic view. More than a thousand feet in height, the top of the hill takes about an hour and half to reach and once you get there, you will find the temple. With the enchanting view of the sea on one side and the hills on the other, this is a view to savour as one of the most cherished memories. There are two ways to climb the hill and you should choose carefully and prepare before you start trekking.Sitakunda Eco-park is to the south of Sitakunda Bazar and only a few kilometres away. It is the first eco-park of Bangladesh and plays host to a wide number of flora and fauna. Hundreds of different types of flowers and trees are nursed here and as always, the vegetation will rejuvenate you with its soothing green touch. The park also offers home to a number of wild animals such as monkeys, rabbits, chimpanzees, etc. that only adds to the natural elements.Waterfalls such as 'Sohosrodhara' and 'Shuptodhara' are part of the park and if you come during rainy season, you can observe the true beauty of them.Also known as Muradpur Beach, it is one of the most attractive sea beaches in Bangladesh. Only 5 kilometres away from Sitakunda Bazar, the Muradpur Beach is a place that will make you feel things that are just indescribable. With the sea on one side, the Keora Forest on the other and the grass spread like a canvas under your feet, this place offers a view that we see in paintings. The breathing roots of the Keora trees are visible sometimes, adding a flavour to this already picture-perfect landscape.The name of this place is pretty accurate. 'Moha' (great) 'Maya' (enthralling) is the only way to describe the effects of this place. Mohamaya Lake is the second largest artificial lake in Bangladesh with an area of 11 square kilometres. Hills, rubber dam, fountains and crystal-clear water — all this together in a cocktail of absolute bliss and to top it off, you can camp and Kayak here.With the Komoldoho Waterfall as the hero of the trail, there are at least five more different waterfalls on this trail. The Komoldoho Waterfall itself is rather dangerous during rainy season because of its nature and therefore should be visited following the departure of the rainy season. Being one of the most challenging and risky trails in Sitakunda, this place makes up for it with the cathartic feeling it offers once you finish the trail.The Jhorjhori trail should not be missed and it offers a challenging route just like Komoldoho. Kumira Ghat will offer you a soothing view of the sea and a perfect place to witness the sunset in all it's glory. Horinmara trail is as interesting as the name itself. Sagolkanda Waterfall or Kamalak Jharna is getting more and more popular amongst travellers lately.
We suggest that instead of trying to fit everything in a tight schedule, slow down a bit and take your time in this place. Prepare for trekking with proper gears and supplies and try to enjoy the adventure rather than making it a chore to be finished in time.The easiest way to get to Sitakunda is by bus. There are plenty of buses departing from Dhaka to Chittagong every few minutes. Pick any transport service you are comfortable with and board a bus of Dhaka-Chittagong route. Easy as that.One might also get there by train if that is more convenient for you. Get down at Feni Railway Station. Then get to Mohipal bus station in any sort of transport and from there you can get on buses headed for Sitakunda.",2022-10-19

/news/world/uk/news/truss-tries-reassert-authority-rebellion-grows-replace-her-3147016,Truss tries to reassert authority as rebellion grows to replace her,"British Prime Minister Liz Truss sought to reassert authority over her fraught party on Wednesday with Conservative enforcers telling lawmakers they had to support her fracking policy as a vote treated as a test of confidence in the government.Truss is trying to shore up support from within her party after she was forced to scrap her vast tax-cutting plan, leading some Conservative lawmakers to call for her to be replaced as leader just weeks after she took office.She has admitted her radical economic plans had gone ""too far and too fast"" after investors dumped the pound and government bonds.However, with mortgage rates soaring and official figures showing inflation back to a 40-year high, Truss, who was elected by Conservative members on a promise of tax cuts and maintaining public spending, faces a struggle to convince the public and her party she could address the cost of living crisis.Polls indicate Conservatives are some 30 points behind the opposition Labour Party, and her own ratings are calamitous.""What I'm not convinced by ... is that going through another leadership campaign, defenestrating another prime minister, will either convince the British people that we're thinking about them rather than ourselves or convince the markets to stay calm,"" foreign minister James Cleverly told Sky News.But, speculation about the prime minister's future continues to grow, with media reporting that rebellious Conservatives are weighing up who should replace her, not if she should go.""I think her position is becoming increasingly untenable,"" Conservative lawmaker Steve Double told Times radio. ""We've seen a complete reversal of just about everything she stood for in her leadership election campaign. I think many of us are asking exactly what does Liz Truss now believe and stand for?""Truss will face parliament later on Wednesday for her usual weekly question and answer session, and later the main opposition Labour Party will seek to hold a vote on an outright ban on fracking, after the government last month lifted a moratorium in England that had been in place since 2019.Conservative 'whips', responsible for enforcing discipline among members of parliament, sent a message to their lawmakers saying the vote would be treated as a ""confidence motion in the government"".",2022-10-19

/news/bangladesh/transport/news/vehicles-seeking-fitness-clearance-drops-7-year-low-3147071,Vehicles seeking fitness clearance drops to a 7-year low,"Despite a sharp rise in vehicle registration in the last fiscal year, the number of vehicles seeking fitness clearance has dropped to a seven-year low during this period, raising serious concerns over road safety.As a result, the number of vehicles without fitness clearances hit a record high. A total of 5.42 lakh registered vehicles, which were supposed to go through fitness tests, did not take the mandatory fitness clearance certificates and are operating on the roads, allegedly due to poor monitoring by the authorities.A huge rise in advance income tax (AIT) amount from July 1, 2021 and decision to give fitness clearance to three types of private vehicles biennially from January 2020, instead of annually, are the major reasons behind the poor number, officials said.Apart from vehicles that have been registered but did not take fitness clearance, thousands of unregistered vehicles are running without undergoing any fitness tests. Unfit vehicles, one of the major concerns about road safety, are claiming more lives, making it major worry for the authorities.A total of 3,186 people died and 3,500 were injured in 3,776 road accidents in first eight month of this year, according to police report, which is much lower than the estimate of other non-government organisations.Till June this year, 52.92 lakh vehicles, mostly motorbikes, got registered with Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), of which 5.23 lakh got registered in the last fiscal year. The number of vehicles registered in 2020-21 fiscal were 4.24 lakh.All vehicles, except for motorcycles, need to take fitness clearance, however, new cars, SUVs and microbuses are not required to have it in the first five years and after that period, they have to get fitness clearance once every two years.Only 5.64 lakh vehicles took fitness clearance in last fiscal year, which is the lowest number since 2014-15 fiscal year, shows BRTA data.

He is also former president of Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE) based in Boston, New England. He hails from Kattali village under Pahartali Police Station of Chattogram district.Judge Thomas Drechsler of the Superior Court of Salem City, Massachusetts on Friday, October 14, revoked Babu's bail on serious charges including rape and strangulation and arrested him pending sentencing before sending him to jail.Following the week-long judicial process, he was ordered to be remanded in custody. According to court sources, Asif Babu will be given the final sentence in the case on November 8.The incident of rape allegedly took place in September 2020.The victim, who has been living in the emergency shelter on Federal Street in Salem with her then 9-year-old daughter after she lost her job due to the pandemic and was unable to pay her rent, testified under questioning by prosecutor Kate MacDougall.While staying there, she searched for a place to live in Medford so her daughter could return to the school she was attending before the eviction, the woman testified, adding that she responded to an ad on Facebook Marketplace for a single room, placed by Chowdhury, and planned to take the room.Several days later, on September 17, 2020, Asif Babu visited the woman in Salem so she could sign a rental agreement. During that meeting is when the assault took place, the woman testified.The woman's daughter told jurors that she was awoken by the sounds of ""a lot of chaos"" and peeked out of the bedroom to see a man standing over her mother. ""She couldn't get up at all,"" the girl told jurors. She backed into the bedroom and called 911 emergency hotline.Salem Police Officer Jonathan Springer was the first to arrive at the shelter and found Asif Babu struggling with the woman near the door. He separated the two.Officer Keegan Stokes then arrived and spoke with the woman, who he said was crying hysterically. Stokes told jurors that he noticed that the kitchen of the shelter apartment was in disarray and found Asif Babu's glasses on the floor.Defense lawyers Syrie Fried and Benjamin Brooks sought to highlight inconsistencies in the woman's account to police, her testimony to a grand jury and her testimony at the trial, and pressed her with questions about Facebook Messenger exchanges in which Babu used heart emojis and paid her compliments.They also suggested the woman started the fight during a dispute over the amount of rent she would pay. ""You became angry and hit him,"" Fried suggested in a question. ""No,"" the woman responded.Fried showed the woman a photo of Asif Babu with scratches on his neck, and the ripped shirt he wore that night.""I was trying to get him off of me,"" the victim responded.Earlier, on November 9, 2019, during the biennial election of the Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE) in Boston, Asif Babu, a candidate for the president from one panel, and his associates beat up a candidate from a rival panel, leaving him seriously injured. When the help of the police was sought to control the situation, the police reached the spot and stopped the polling. Based on the said incident, Khoka-Nabi-Sami Parishad sports secretary candidate SM Sajjad Hossain filed a case against Asif Babu with the local police. A few weeks later, the case was settled with the intervention of some alleged community leaders in Boston.Despite allegations of widespread irregularities in that election, Asif Babu was elected president of the Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE) for a two-year term. This year, he appointed his wife Parvin Chowdhury as the president of BANE. Noman Sabit is a freelance journalist based in New York, US",2022-10-20

/environment/natural-resources/energy/news/the-russian-problem-new-us-nuclear-power-industry-3147926,The Russian problem of new US nuclear power industry,"US firms developing a new generation of small nuclear power plants to help cut carbon emissions have a big problem: only one company sells the fuel they need, and it's Russian.That's why the US government is urgently looking to use some of its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium to help fuel the new advanced reactors and kick-start an industry it sees as crucial for countries to meet global net-zero emissions goals.""Production of HALEU is a critical mission and all efforts to increase its production are being evaluated,"" a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said.The energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine has renewed interest in nuclear power. Backers of smaller, next-generation reactors say they are more efficient, quicker to build, and could turbocharge the shift away from fossil fuels.But without a reliable source of the high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) the reactors need, developers worry they won't receive orders for their plants. And without orders, potential producers of the fuel are unlikely to get commercial supply chains up and running to replace the Russian uranium.""We understand the need for urgent action to incentivize the establishment of a sustainable, market-driven supply of HALEU,"" the DOE spokesperson said.The US government is in the final stages of evaluating how much of its inventory of 585.6 tonnes of highly enriched uranium to allocate to reactors, the spokesperson said.The fact that Russia has a monopoly on HALEU has long been a concern for Washington but the war in Ukraine has changed the game, as neither the government nor the companies developing the new advanced reactors want to rely on Moscow.HALEU is enriched to levels of up to 20%, rather than around 5% for the uranium that powers most nuclear plants. But only TENEX, which is part of Russian state-owned nuclear energy company Rosatom, sells HALEU commercially at the moment.While no Western countries have sanctioned Rosatom over Ukraine, mainly because of its importance to the global nuclear industry, US power plant developers such as X-energy and TerraPower don't want to be dependent on a Russian supply chain.""We didn't have a fuel problem until a few months ago,"" said Jeff Navin, director of external affairs at TerraPower, whose chairman is billionaire Bill Gates. ""After the invasion of Ukraine, we were not comfortable doing business with Russia.""Nuclear power currently generates about 10% of the world's electricity and many countries are now exploring new nuclear projects to improve their energy supply and energy security, as well as to help meet goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.But with large-scale projects still challenging for reasons including huge up-front costs, project delays, cost overruns and competition from cheaper energy sources such as wind, several developers have proposed so-called small modular reactors (SMR).While the SMRs on offer from companies such as EDF (EDF.PA) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) use existing technology and the same fuel as traditional reactors, nine out of 10 of the advanced reactors funded by Washington are designed to use HALEU.Proponents say these advanced plants need less frequent refuelling and are three times as efficient as traditional models. Some analysts say this means they will ultimately overtake conventional nuclear technology, though the designs have yet to be tested on a commercial scale.The average levelised cost of electricity - the price needed for advanced projects to break even - is $60 per megawatt-hour compared with $97 for conventional plants, according to data from research group the Energy Innovation Reform Project.Some analysts say the price difference might be narrower at the moment, because the smaller advanced reactors using HALEU don't yet have economies of scale from mass production.Companies in the United States and Europe have plans to produce HALEU on a commercial scale but even in the most optimistic scenarios, they say it would take at least five years from the point they decide to proceed.And this chicken and egg conundrum is complicating the smooth development of HALEU supply.""Nobody wants to order 10 reactors without a fuel source, and nobody wants to invest in a fuel source without 10 reactor orders,"" said Daniel Poneman, chief executive of US nuclear fuel supplier Centrus Energy Corp (LEU.A).For firms interested in new advanced reactors, such as Washington state's public utility Energy Northwest, fuel supplies are certainly an issue in the decision making process.""A reliable HALEU supply is one of many factors under consideration,"" the company said in an emailed statement.The US government recognised years ago that Russia's monopoly on HALEU could hamper the development of the advanced reactors it hopes will provide low-carbon energy at home and also be exported to markets in Europe and Asia.The government awarded a shared-cost contract in 2019 to Centrus, the only company outside Russia which currently has a licence to make HALEU, to build a demonstration facility.While the facility was due to start making HALEU this year, production has been put back to 2023, partly because of delays in getting hold of storage containers due to supply chain issues during the global pandemic, Centrus said.Once the facility gets up and running, it will take five years before Centrus can start producing 13 tonnes of HALEU a year. But that's only a third of the amount the DOE projects will be needed for US reactors by 2030.TerraPower, for example, said it will need 15 tonnes of HALEU for the first fuel load of its advanced reactor.Other potential HALEU producers are further behind.French state-owned uranium mining and enrichment company Orano says it could start producing HALEU in five to eight years, but will only apply for a production licence once it has customers with long-term contracts.In a response to a DOE request for information about how to establish a programme to support HALEU production, Orano said it would be down to the US government to kick-start the industry.""Orano's assessment shows that the single most important factor enabling success is the DOE guaranteeing a certain volume of demand,"" the company said in a statement on its website.European uranium enrichment company Urenco, meanwhile, says it is considering sites in the United States and Britain for HALEU production but has yet to apply for licences.For TerraPower and X-energy, which have projects planned in the U.S. states of Wyoming and Washington respectively, the clock is ticking.Washington awarded them contracts to build two demonstration rectors by 2028 and shared the costs. But without Russian fuel, that deadline will fall well before any alternative commercial suppliers would be up and running.While the 20% enrichment levels for HALEU are well below the roughly 90% level needed for weapons, companies need special licences to produce it. Additional security and certification requirements are also required for production sites, packaging and transportation of the fuel.To speed up the process and break the deadlock, the US government is looking to ""downblend"" weapons-grade highly enriched uranium sitting in its stockpile, though that will also take time.The US government said in 2016 it had downblended 7.1 tonnes between Sept. 30, 2013 and March 31, 2016. Asked this month whether the process had become any faster, the DOE said: ""Downblending rates are consistently evaluated for acceleration opportunities.""The Inflation Reduction Act US President Joe Biden signed in August contained $700 million to secure HALEU supplies from the government and a consortium partnered with the DOE for use in advanced reactors and research.In September, the White House asked Congress for another $1.5 billion in a temporary government funding bill to boost domestic supply of low enriched uranium and HALEU, to address potential difficulties in accessing Russian fuel.Lawmakers took the measure out of the bill over concerns about costs, though it remains a priority for some Biden officials, including Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.Last year, nuclear power stations in the United States imported about 14% of their uranium from Russia, along with 28% of their enrichment services, according to the US Energy Information Administration.",2022-10-20

Other sellers, however good their offers might be, are effectively shut out.An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement: This claim is without merit and were confident that will become clear through the legal process.The lawsuit is expected to be filed at the CAT by the end of this month and will have to be certified by the tribunal before it can proceed.It is being brought on an opt-out basis, meaning that any potential claimants will be included in the claim unless they choose to opt out.The case follows the announcement by Britain's antitrust watchdog in July that it is investigating Amazon over suspected breaches of competition law, including how it selects which products are placed within the Buy Box feature.Amazon has faced similar probes elsewhere, recently making an offer to the European Commission to avert possible hefty EU antitrust fines.The platform has also declined to describe its product-search system to an Australian competition regulator which has heard complaints of large marketplace platforms giving preference to in-house wares.The CAT authorised an estimated US $1.1 billion (920 million-pound) damages claim against Google in July and approved another case worth up to 1.7 billion pounds against Apple in May.The tribunal is also due to decide in January whether to give the go-ahead to a claim valued at up to 2.2 billion pounds against Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, over alleged anti-competitive behaviour.Google and Apple deny the allegations against them, according to court filings, and Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.",2022-10-20

Overall, the premises looked cosy but conventional at the same time; enumerating a picturesque view for both formal office lunches or just a casual hang out with friends.""The initial response really surprised us. We were optimistic but did not expect such overwhelmingly positive feedback; that too, without involving influencer marketing or anything of that sort. I guess that is because satisfying quality and customer service is what everyone seeks at the end of the day, it is the best form of marketing,"" shared Tanjir Rahman Arnob, the owner of the restaurant.Arnob is an MBA graduate from North South University who began his journey with Yatai (a word for shop stand in Japanese) in Rajshahi. He chose the distant area of Rajshahi instead of the bustling Dhaka city then, as he identified the market gap for many job holders who reside there but are not accommodated with the right place to dine in. Over time, Yatai emerged victorious there and finally made itself a new home in the capital.Our feast began with the serving of colourful Maki Rolls as appetizers: Volcano, California, Fried Prawns, Chicken Teriyaki and much more — all prepared in front of our eyes in the live kitchen. The rolls tasted delish, given that the chefs tried to incorporate a hint of local taste in the dish; delivering a perfect blend of spices, sweet and savoury. Next was the tummy-filling Classic Bento Box — consisting of all items that a bento usually offers. Starting from rice, chicken nanban, tempuras, katsu chicken, etc. accompanied by flavourful honey mustard and soya sauce — all arranged together. Although the tempuras seemed a little under-fried as per our taste, the other items provided in the bento box were top notch; both in times of quality and quantity. Also, the menu exhibited other varieties of soup, dumplings and bento boxes too:  seafood, supreme and Yatai special that we have plans of endeavouring in our next visits. ""I realized the Bangladeshi youth is versatile. They will try to adapt to anything new that we offer them at affordable prices,"" added Arnob.Next, the bill came in with the pre-ordered seasonal fresh fruit juices, energizing our bloated tummies to a great extent. Indeed, what Arnob said was true. The youth is actually happy to try new food at reasonable prices, as the total bill amounted to around Tk 1800-2000 for a fulfilling meal for two, including palatable sushi items (which are usually so pricey elsewhere in the capital).Finally, as we were done with our shares of the aesthetic photo session, we stood up to leave. Just then, a voice echoed behind our backs.""Ma'am, please wait. Here's a complimentary dessert for you! A gesture for our loyal customers, as we hope for you to be.""We felt like happy children on cloud nine as we devoured the creamy, smoking brownie topped with vanilla ice-cream as a finish to our amazing experience at Yatai.",2022-10-20

/shout/news/experiencing-architecture-around-us-3147426,Experiencing architecture around us,"A space is more than a vicinity that shelters us. It morphs our emotions, helps our thoughts take shape, carves out a pathway to meet like-minded people, and creates communities. We spend a large fraction of our lives indoors, which impacts us in ways we don't even realise. Such is the pedigree of a discipline that is forged by culture and society. The application of architecture isn't merely to keep track of our physical footprints, it is a practice that is also meant to address our needs. By building on existing values and having them interweave with the contemporary, architecture, in turn, also shapes culture and society.Whether to represent royalty, protect from harsh climates, or spark awe, architecture has always been emblematic of its time, location, and climate. Igloos are built with ice due to their low thermal conductivity and accessibility in the region. Japanese and Chinese architectural identities overlap due to their connection to Buddhism. The Taj Mahal utilises concepts of symmetry as well as rational and strict geometry to perpetuate the notion that Mughal leadership is flawless. A closer look at Dhaka and the parallels between the city and the livelihood of its people float to the surface. An urban jungle, lined with grey cement blocks as far as the eye can see. No corner is spared. Does it all stand to represent that people are trying to just get by? As morbid as this outlook might be, I am certain I am not the only one who bears it.Nuren Iftekhar, a Dhaka University graduate currently working as a teacher abroad, shares his views. ""Dhaka often feels like a canvas that different artists tried to paint on at the same time. A canvas that then got painted over by an amateur mason,"" he says. ""Functionality has far outpaced the sense of beauty or cohesion. A walk through my area only shows apartments whose sole purpose is to hold as many people as the zoning board approves. Wide stretched balconies have been replaced by tiny alcoves with the sole purpose of drying clothes.""Rashed H. Chowdhury, the principal architect at Dehsarworks, highlights the significance of architecture on the zeitgeist. ""A built environment is the result of all our collective effort and thoughts. While architects are the ones designing the spaces, they are responding to the needs of society. The projects also affect our conscious minds. The cause and effect go hand-in-hand.""""The primary identifier of any nation is its architectural landmarks, and I believe it is a visible envelope of our society,"" he said.A building, even with its ornamental exterior and grand scale, is only as good as the amenities of the interior. If the space inside fails to fulfil its function, then by no means does it qualify as good design. By carefully curating the right forms, colours, shapes, light, and proportions, designers can influence how an occupant might feel.""If anyone is stuck in a room that isn't exposed to natural light, has the same temperature throughout the day, and boasts no tangible change in the interior, it creates fatigue amongst its occupants,"" asserts Rashed.Iftekhar recalls what stood out to him about the design of Curzon Hall, where he attended classes in university. ""Perhaps the most noticeable aspect of Curzon hall was the uniformity. From the old halls to the newly established buildings, it is present everywhere. Even the Zoology building, with its separate colour scheme, felt like an extension of the original architectural vision. Any deviation from it feels jarring which is evident in the newer buildings. Despite having better accommodation, they never evoked the same feeling that Curzon hall did,"" he said.   Subah Shaheen, Manager at Robi Axiata Limited, discusses the use of symbolism in her workplace, ""Our workplace has a great interior. There are words and icons dispersed throughout the walls on each floor, representing the core values, visions and objectives of the company. This not only reinforces what we hear in meetings and townhalls but is a constant reminder throughout the day about what we are trying to achieve and why.""There is evidence that using certain elements in the interior will evoke a specific kind of ambience and mood. Furthermore, a building serves a wide variety of needs of many different people. Even then, the space must serve more than one purpose for each individual Therefore, it really isn't feasible to predict how one might respond to their environment.Iftekhar comments on how the architecture of Dhaka University and Curzon Hall makes him feel. ""The first thing that Curzon hall evoked in my mind as I first stepped foot there as a freshman was grandeur. As cliched as it sounds, the wide hallway, the old arches and the red bricks gave it a sense of timelessness.""""Having a common space in every floor creates an opportunity for social interaction within the office. The space enables employees to have important discussions, enjoy a game of foosball, and does wonders to help relax during the day. It also helps us save time as you don't have to get out of the office to unwind,"" said Subah about her workplace.New spaces must be designed to meet various needs. However, what appears to have taken precedence are economic benefits. Allowing capitalistic interests to dictate urban planning causes efficiency to trump empathy for the people. In the process, citizens are left stuck with a lack of open spaces, poorly designed footpaths, and a monotonous cityscape. Urban planners and policymakers must instil changes that account for the welfare of the people.In a write-up for The Grudging Urbanist titled ""There is just one way to save Dhaka"", Adnan Zillur Morshed, renowned architect, architectural historian, and urbanist, attributed the capital's rampant traffic crisis to a lack of land-use planning. ""We allowed the city to become an untenable urban juggernaut, an infernal urban agglomeration, paying little attention to how the city's land could be developed with a logical sequence of use and zoning,"" he says.He urges that Dhaka undertake land-use planning – a system that opts for areas to facilitate schools, grocery shops, malls and other venues for recreation within walking distance of the residents. As a result, it will eliminate the need to travel long distances and reduce congestion within the city.""I think what can really help the capital embrace openness is to first improve public transport. Discouraging the use of personal vehicles and harbouring collective commute is vital. It bunches people up and frees up space. The prospect of being a part of a community should be cherished and design should enable that. The fabric of the city should be people-centric,"" remarked Rashed.Nonetheless, what plagues much of Dhaka is the invasion of open spaces. Footpaths are occupied, fields are a parading ground for local politicians, seasonal melas, or construction sites, and due to the steep climb in the rate of urbanisation, water bodies are at risk because of housing accommodations.While it will generate employment in the tertiary sector, create new forms of income, and help the economy, this approach is myopic. Natural resources are compromised and historical landmarks are destroyed all for the sake of ""development"". What gets overlooked, as a result, are other problems that will have to be tackled in the future. If the correct measures are not taken now, the benefits of the present will merely be consolation.An architect can let all the principles of design guide them but a design that is not centred around people is a design that will inevitably fail. Spaces are social spheres, grounds for igniting important conversations and inspiring change. A city that breeds unhappiness is a place that is waiting to fall apart. To nourish it is to let its inhabitants thrive. It is time we let consciousness spearhead architecture and design.   Rashed Chowdhury is hopeful about the future of architecture. He believes what allows it to thrive and makes it a promising field is the vastness, scope of innovation, geopolitical nature of Bangladesh and the spirit of youth.""Unlike anywhere else in the world, Bangladeshi architecture incorporates a lot of diversity. Due to the reform having grey area, we are allowed to venture out and explore,"" he concludes.Abir Hossain is a sub-editor at SHOUT, The Daily Star. Reach him at abir.hossain@thedailystar.net

/opinion/project-syndicate/news/wars-arent-won-peacetime-economies-3147846,Wars aren’t won with peacetime economies,"Politically, the G7 and like-minded countries around the world have adopted a war footing to stop Russian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin violated the most fundamental principle of international law by launching an attack on another member of the United Nations – an institution created explicitly to prevent such aggression. The dangers of appeasement should be obvious. Even a little empathy should make us shudder in horror at the prospect of having to live under Putin's rule. It is a peculiar war. While Putin has described his project as a confrontation with the entire West, Ukrainians alone are doing all the fighting and bearing the full brunt of Russian attacks. Meanwhile, Europe and America have provided economic and military assistance, and the rest of the world has been dealing with the war's fallout, including higher energy and food prices.But it is a mistake to think that the war can be won with a peacetime economy. No country has ever prevailed in a serious war by leaving markets alone. Markets simply move too slowly for the kind of major structural changes that are required. Wars inevitably cause shortages and generate windfall gains for some at the expense of others. Historically, war profiteers have typically been executed. But today, they include many energy producers and traders who, rather than being marched to the gallows, should be subjected to a windfall profits tax. The European Union has proposed such a measure, but it would come too late, and it is too weak and too narrow for the challenge at hand. Similarly, while several members of the US Congress have put forward bills to tax Big Oil's superprofits, the Biden administration has so far failed to move on the issue. That is understandable, given that US President Joe Biden has been busy enlisting support for signal achievements like the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. Moreover, in seeking the private sector's cooperation in limiting price increases, he has been at pains not to appear ""anti-business."" But taxing windfall profits and using the proceeds to finance the necessary war spending and support for those hurt by high prices is not anti-business; it is responsible wartime governance, which is necessary to maintain popular support for the war effort. Even more comprehensive measures are needed in Europe, where today's electricity market was not designed to deal with wartime conditions. Instead, it follows the principle of marginal-cost pricing. That means the electricity price reflects the highest-cost source of production needed to meet current demand. As fuel prices have soared, marginal costs have risen far above average costs. The cost of renewable energy has, for instance, changed little. As such, many sellers of low-cost electricity are making a killing, as are the traders who bought energy at the lower pre-war prices. While these market players reap billions of euros in profits, consumers' electricity bills are soaring. Electricity prices in energy-rich Norway, with its enormous gas and oil reserves and hydro capacity, have increased nearly tenfold. Meanwhile, households and small businesses are being pushed to the brink, and even some big companies have already gone bankrupt. The European principle of ""no state aid"" has been thrown aside, mainly because European leaders moved too slowly in changing a market structure that was not designed for war. Economists love marginal-cost pricing because it provides appropriate incentives, and because its distributive consequences tend to be small and easily manageable in normal times. But now, the system's incentive effects are small and its distributive effects are enormous. In the short run, consumers and small businesses will have to turn down their thermostat in the winter and turn it up in the summer, but comprehensive energy-saving investments take time to plan and implement. Fortunately, there is a simpler system that would retain most of marginal-cost pricing's incentive effects without the distributive effects. Under a non-linear pricing framework, households and firms could be allowed to purchase 90 percent of their previous year's supply at the previous year's price, and 91-110 percent of supply at, say, 150 percent of the previous year's price, before the marginal-cost price kicks in. While non-linear pricing can't be used in many markets – owing to the possibility of ""arbitrage"" (buying a good at a low price and immediately reselling it at a much higher price) – electricity is not one of them. That is why some economists have long advocated its use in cases where large market failures are having important distributive effects. It is a powerful tool that governments can and should use, especially when confronting wartime conditions. Such changes have become imperative. As the Vietnamese understood, wars are won as much on the political front as on the battlefield. The purpose of the 1968 Tet Offensive was not to gain territory but to change the political calculus of the war, and it worked. Defeating Russia obviously will require more help for Ukraine. But it will also require a better economic response on the part of the West more broadly. That starts with sharing more of the burden through windfall profit taxes, controlling key prices – such as those for electricity and food – and encouraging government interventions where necessary to alleviate critical shortages. Neoliberalism, based on simplistic ideas about how markets should operate that fail to comprehend how they actually operate, didn't work even in peacetime. It must not be allowed to stop us from winning this war. Joseph E Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics, is professor at Columbia University and a member of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation.",2022-10-20

/shout/news/why-are-so-many-genres-dying-out-3148681,Why are so many genres dying out?,"Rom-coms, chick flicks and teen movies from the 1990's and 2000's are still considered to be some of the best ones made of those genres. Films such as The Notebook, Clueless, Legally Blonde and many others are cult classics that people still reference even to this day. While some not all of them have aged very well, they are well loved and taken the form of comfort watches for many people even after all this time, and will continue to be for the years to come.But most of the movies of this genre that have been released in recent years don't garner the same love. Very few of the recent releases are actually well-received by critics or audiences, and a lot of the views come from people who hate-watch it just to see how bad it can be. So, what is the reason for this drop in quality?It starts with the fall of DVDs and rise of streaming services. Previously, films would be first released in the box office, and then a few months later, it would be available for rent or purchase. This meant they could earn more and over a longer period of time. Since DVDs have completely been replaced by streaming services, this secondary source of income no longer exists.Standalone movies with frivolous plots were hardly ever box office hits, and would rely on DVD sales to turn a profit, but now they have to wait to be licensed by a streaming service to be their primary source of income.If something isn't automatically popular, then the chances of them being picked up by streaming services become very low, so they're just not guaranteed to be profitable anymore.Nowadays, the only films that give its makers any kind of gains now are either sequels of existing franchises for being easy box office hits, or art films that at least bag a few nominations at major award shows. Because of this, big-name production houses, talented writers and A-listers exclusively focus on these two types of movies.After all, why should they bother with a silly movie that brings them nothing in the near future when they can work on something that can at least give them a decent paycheque or some exposure in the form of awards? Movies like Mean Girls that were made with love, and starred actors that could pull off the script don't exist anymore, because no one knows when they'll make a profit or at least gain a cult following. So, they are considered not worth the hassle.There is still some demand for these movies, and now they're mostly produced by streaming services or low-budget production houses, so they don't generally have the same level of attention given to them. Most of their screenplays now are adapted from Wattpad novels-turned-published books like After, or just have questionable scripts like Tall Girl. The actors they employ aren't usually charming enough to pull it off either, and so what could be a campy, mindless watch just becomes plain unbearable.This doesn't mean that all movies of this type are bad. Netflix's Do Revenge was relatively well-received, and are leading some to believe that maybe there might be a resurgence of these movies again. Hopefully, we don't have to rely on films released 20-30 years ago for some feel-good vibes.Namreen is sick and tired. Send a reminder that life goes on at: namreen.shaiyaz@gmail.com

""Boris Johnson can win the next general election.""But Johnson, who left office comparing himself to a Roman dictator twice brought into power to fight crises, might not reach the 100 nomination threshold after his three-year premiership was blighted by scandals and allegations of misconduct.The Financial Times said a Boris comeback would be ""farcical"".One of his former advisers, who no longer speaks to Johnson and requested not to be identified, said he was unlikely to reach the target, having alienated dozens of Conservative lawmakers.Will Walden, who also once worked for Johnson, said the former leader was returning from holiday and taking soundings.Business minister Jacob Rees-Mogg tweeted his support, using the hashtag ""#Borisorbust"".Defence Secretary Ben Wallace ruled himself out of the running and said he was leaning towards backing Johnson, who led the party to a large majority at a 2019 national election.Sunak, the former Goldman Sachs analyst who became finance minister just as the Covid-19 pandemic arrived in Europe and was runner-up to Truss in the summer's leadership contest, is the favourite with bookmakers, followed by Johnson.Third-placed is Penny Mordaunt, a former defence minister popular with party members who came third last time. None have formally declared their candidacy.A Reuters tally of Conservative lawmakers who have made public declarations of support put Sunak on 54 backers, Johnson on 29 and Mordaunt on 16.Britain's shortest-serving prime minister, Truss quit after her economic plans were rejected by investors, hitting the pound and pushing up borrowing costs, forcing a U-turn under a new finance minister after she sacked her closest political ally.The sight on Thursday of yet another unpopular prime minister making a resignation speech in Downing Street - and the start of a new leadership race - underscored how volatile British politics has become since the 2016 Brexit vote.Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said Brexit had brought instability to Britain.""I hope that they will soon be stable because even if they are not a family member anymore they are a friend and a neighbour. We need them and they need us too,"" he told reporters on arrival for an EU summit in Brussels.The Conservative Party has a big majority in parliament and can ignore calls for an election, but opposition parties, some newspapers and even a few of its own lawmakers have said voters should now be given a say.""The Tories (Conservatives) cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,"" Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said.""They do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment.""Some Conservative lawmakers have urged colleagues to coalesce around one candidate to minimise the bruising.Sunak, who had warned that Truss's fiscal plan threatened the economy, remains unpopular with some party members after he helped to trigger the rebellion against Johnson.Mordaunt is seen as a fresh face, largely untainted by earlier administrations but is also untested.The next leader will inherit an economy heading for recession, with rising interest rates and inflation over 10% leaving millions facing a cost-of-living squeeze.Surveys on Friday showed British shoppers have reined in their spending sharply and put their confidence levels near record lows, while worse-than-expected public borrowing figures underscored the economic challenges ahead.Truss's spokeswoman said work was continuing on a fiscal plan due to be set out on October 31 but that it would be for her successor to decide whether to proceed with it.Whoever takes over also has a mountain to climb to restore the party's own reputation.""Whether or not a change of leader is going to be sufficient to make the Conservatives actually electorally credible is certainly highly debatable,"" political scientist John Curtice told LBC.",2022-10-21

Police later arrested examinee Shafiqul Islam, room invigilators Kabir Iqbal and Ahmed Zibril and peon Zahurul Islam.Pirganj Upazila Social Service Officer Md Rafiqul Islam filed a case with Thakurgaon Police Station against eight persons including the four arrestees in this connection. Mentionable, the recruitment test for the post of Grade III social worker for the 16th batch across the country was held today.At least 10,788 job seekers have applied from Thakurgaon.

/opinion/views/news/will-earth-remain-inhabitable-after-2050-3148491,Will Earth remain inhabitable after 2050?,"It is quite a dicey time for our planet. In the last 100 years or so, because of our unrestrained use of fossil fuels and systematic overexploitation of the natural resources, we have pushed the planet towards climatological catastrophe. Simply put, we dug ourselves into a deep hole, yet we have not stopped digging.To pull us out of the hole, world leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris Accords to keep the ""global temperature increase in this century to two degrees Celsius while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees."" In order to achieve this goal, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) wants us to halve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 and attain net zero emissions by 2050.With that in mind, our leaders are going to meet for the 27th time, from November 6-18, in Sharm el-Sheikh, a resort town in Egypt, to discuss an array of issues related to climate change and renew for the sixth time their commitment to deliver on the Paris Agreement.Realistically speaking, at the current pace of GHG emissions that is even faster than what was predicted in the early 21st century, and, more importantly, our leaders back-pedalling on the pledges made at the Paris conference, the blueprint for net zero emissions seems like a pipe dream. Under these circumstances, the state of our planet in 2050 seems frightening.In Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, as well as Europe and North America, summer will arrive months earlier, and with vengeance, as it did in 2021 and 2022. Persistent heat waves will afflict much of the population, resulting in hundreds of thousands of heat-related deaths. Furthermore, it is highly likely that the wet-bulb temperature will oftentimes surpass 35 degrees Celsius, which is the upper limit of human adaptability to heat and humidity. Extremely hot summers will mean more frequent, intense and wide-ranging forest fires burning more trees that will release more carbon dioxide, driving global temperatures even higher. The smog-filled filthy air will kill countless people living nearby. In addition to dirtier air, warmer weather will act as a catalyst for chemical reactions, producing many toxic pollutants, including ground-level ozone which, when inhaled, will aggravate respiratory conditions like asthma and emphysema.As the world warms, rainfalls in Bangladesh during monsoon will become more erratic, less predictable, frightfully dangerous, and immeasurably devastating. The recent cataclysmic floods in Bangladesh's Sylhet and Pakistan due to record monsoon rains and melting glaciers in the Himalayas indicate that by 2050, villages will become small islands in an inland sea. Besides floods, heavy and incessant rainfalls will trigger landslides that have already demolished many homes and claimed hundreds of lives in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and high mountain regions in Asia and elsewhere. In sum, the changing pattern of monsoon will put millions of people in peril.Augmented by rising sea levels, cyclonic storms will cause the coastal cliffs in Bangladesh, that act as natural barriers against high tides, to collapse. As a consequence, people living in low-lying coastal areas will experience incursions of seawater more often during storm surges, where freshwater supplies will be contaminated and undrinkable, agricultural land will be damaged because of increased salinity, and waterborne diseases will become increasingly common. Additionally, along with many coastal cities and island nations, a large portion of Bangladesh will be underwater.Massive build-up of heat will turn the high latitude regions of the northern hemisphere – within and outside the Arctic Circle – into wastelands. Inland glaciers, a major source of freshwater, will become a thing of the past. A hotter climate in the Arctic belt will impact the global climate system as a whole through the enhanced release of greenhouse gases, especially the highly potent methane, from thawed permafrost.According to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, global warming will turn more than 25 percent of the Earth into desert. The Sahara Desert will extend to parts of southern Europe. A warmer Earth will exacerbate droughts, mainly outside of the tropics, with far-reaching consequences. They will be drawn-out, leading to acute shortages of water and mass starvation in many parts of the world. Droughts will also drastically raise the number of climate refugees.The UN's International Office of Migration (IOM) speculates that by 2050, over a billion people will be displaced globally due to climate change. The number of people living in cities will likely triple. People in Dhaka, currently 22.5 million, can expect to rub their shoulders with an additional 13–15 million climate refugees.Food insecurity, dearth of water and energy, together with depleted resources, will provide the spark that will push otherwise peaceful nations into war. Moreover, famine, poverty, unstable governments, vast inequalities within societies, and control for life-sustaining resources will incite riots and civil wars.This is just a small glimpse into what our planet may look like in 2050. To keep our planet inhabitable beyond 2050, we need courageous, visionary leaders with new ideas. Arguably, most of the leaders of the major GHG-emitting nations lack these traits.So, what is the endgame? In January 2016, British-born American astronaut and climate scientist Piers Sellers wrote in The New York Times on his perspectives on climate change, ""There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks. History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots. The winners tended to be realistic, pragmatic, and flexible; the losers were often in denial of the threat.""Sellers' optimistic take on confronting climate change gives us hope for the future. Hence, the doom and gloom picture painted here is not the endgame, nor is it an inevitable future. However, because climate change cannot be curbed through established political systems controlled by the ""losers,"" concerned citizens have to shape the agenda through grassroots work. Otherwise, our planet will be thrown off its axis, plunging into an irreversible feedback loop of ever-hotter, ever-deadlier conditions. And by 2050, uninhabitability of the Earth may become a harsh reality.Dr Quamrul Haider is a professor of physics at Fordham University in New York, US.

/news/bangladesh/news/it-was-eyewash-3148286,"Stakeholders’ consultation mostly ignored in final draft of social media, OTT regulation","Even though Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) had invited feedback on the draft of its new social media regulation, the finalised version shows that little or no heed was paid to the major stakeholders.Last Wednesday, BTRC gave the High Court the meeting minutes of the last three sessions held by the Regulation Formation Committee when finalising the draft of the regulation. The minutes portray that crucial feedback given by stakeholders was not even discussed, let alone adopted.The finalised ""BTRC Regulation for Digital, Social Media and OTT Platforms"" was submitted to the High Court on the same day.The final draft allows the government to order individuals to take down content, empowers it to order social media companies to block content, and grants it indemnity for its actions under the law.Over the months, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), Bangladesh Legal Aid Services Trust (BLAST), Global Network Initiatives and others sent feedback ringing alarm bells about the government constricting the space for free expression.BLAST, in its recommendations, had told BTRC that ""imposing restrictions on the creation and dissemination of online content will create a chilling effect on freedom of expression concerning issues of rights and justice, including by and about marginalised communities, and will inhibit democratic debate and discourse.""""The grounds on which social media intermediaries are required to take down content are similar to certain Digital Security Act provisions that have already been identified by commentators as arbitrarily restricting freedom of speech and expression,"" read the recommendations by BLAST.The grounds on which social media intermediaries are required to take down content are similar to certain Digital Security Act provisions that have already been identified by commentators as arbitrarily restricting freedom of speech and expression. BLAST, in its recommendations on the regulation
This includes content that threatens the ""unity, integrity, defence, security, or sovereignty of Bangladesh, [and its] friendly relations with foreign states"" or ""is against the Liberation War of Bangladesh, the spirit of the Liberation War, the Father of the Nation, the national anthem, or the national flag"", ""threatens the secrecy of the government"" or ""creates unrest or disorder or deteriorates the law and order situation"" or ""threatens public order"".
TIB had pointed out that requiring all social media intermediaries, tech companies, internet service providers, OTT platforms and online news publishers to get locally registered, and empowering BTRC to cancel the registration if their activities go against the regulation will put them in a bodysuit.
It said it puts foreign companies at risk of surveillance and disincentivises them from operating in Bangladesh.
These concerns -- among many others -- were not addressed and the finalised draft still retains these provisions.
The BTRC submission to the HC reads, ""It was agreed that the Regulation shall be finalised after necessary consideration and/or evaluation of the feedback/input from several concerned stakeholders in this regard.""
Yet this commitment to evaluate feedback from stakeholders is not reflected in the meeting minutes.
During the eleventh session, held on September 4, the committee reviewed the definitions of terms like ""content"", ""digital device"", ""intermediary"" and ""curated content"".
Two weeks later, on September 18, the committee met again for their twelfth session. They discussed and decided that companies that are already registered, do not need to register again. However, it did not speak of doing away with the requirement.
During this meeting, they decided to adopt one feedback made by Global Network Initiatives (GNI), a collective whose members include Meta, Microsoft, Uber, Zoom, Telenor Group, Yahoo, Google, Nokia, Vodafone, Verizon, Human Rights Watch, Wikimedia, Committee to Protect Journalists and others.
GNI had expressed alarm at the fact that the draft regulation features excessive penalties for violations, including fines of up to Tk 3 billion and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years and targets company personnel.
During the 12th meeting, the committee decided to scrap criminal liability, and include corporate liability instead. The latest draft kept intact provisions for fines if the regulations were violated but removed the ceilings that were mentioned in the previous drafts. Instead, it just added that the ""fine should not be excessive"".
In addition, during the 12th meeting, the committee dropped the section in the previous draft that forced companies to circumvent end-to-end encryption and identify ""first originators"" of any content or message sent.
Ten days later, the committee met for the 13th time, and finalised the draft, leaving key concerns up in the air.
Ashish Kumar Kundu, the director-general (legal and licensing division), who signed the meeting minutes, told this newspaper that many stakeholders were consulted and met with before this draft was finalised.
The commissioner of the division was contacted several times over the phone, but this newspaper was unable to reach him.

/opinion/views/news/space-the-final-frontier-superpower-rivalry-3148591,Is space the final frontier of superpower rivalry?,"The Hollywood film The Martian (2015, 20th Century Fox) is an inspiring story of how collaboration in space can help everyone. A crewed mission to Mars leaves the planet in a hurry to avoid an imminent storm, mistakenly leaving behind one of their astronauts Mark Watney. Back on earth, mission control considers him dead, only to find that Watney has survived by sheer ingenuity. NASA plans to detour another mission to rescue Watney. But it is too risky, and time is running out. The Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA) scientists are also watching the situation. Their till then classified booster rocket can help bring Watney back and they offer to do so. After a highly complex manoeuvre and intense happy-ending drama à la Hollywood, Watney returns.But such collaborations between the two space powers can happen only in movies because Americans enacted a law in 2011 to stop just that. Republican Congressman Frank Wolf introduced a bill to bar NASA and all other American agencies from working with Chinese organisations. The bill, known as the Wolf Amendment, practically blocks all avenues of collaboration between the two most active space players. The battle for economic, technological, and geopolitical superiority has thus gone to space. In the International Space Station (ISS), Washington has deliberately excluded Beijing where hundreds of astronauts from 19 nations including Moscow have participated.However, instead of stalling, such exclusions have only persuaded Beijing to build its own space station, the Tiangong, which is scheduled for completion this year. The plan for ISS is decommissioning in 2024, and if the US and its partners do not extend its life, Tiangong may become the only crewed outpost in orbit. China has invited all nations to join it, but the Wolf Amendment will bar NASA astronauts from doing so even if they want to.China is a late entrant in the space race. It put the first satellite into orbit in 1970 after which there wasn't much progress for a long time. It has, however, caught up and in the past 10 years, launched more than two hundred crewed and uncrewed spaceships. In December 2020, it sent an uncrewed mission, Chang'e 5, to the Moon to collect rock samples from a site not visited by any other nation before. China's progress in space has so far been stunning, which General John Raymond, chief of space operations of the US Space Force has summarised as ""from zero to 60 really quick."" China also completed its own satellite navigation system BeiDou in 2020, offering complete global navigation service like America's GPS, Europe's Galileo, and Russia's GNSS. On January 2, 2019, China landed a space probe on the dark side of the moon, which no other nation has done yet. In July, China's first successful interplanetary mission completed mapping the Red Planet a little over a year after its arrival.China's fast-progressing space technology has raised concerns that it can be used as a weapon against enemy satellites. Space technology is inherently dual-purpose and can power low-end reversible jammers, direct energy weapons such as lasers, and direct-ascent kinetic missiles which can destroy any satellite in orbit. Judging from the developments so far, it is quite likely that China already owns such weapons for use in a conflict. Fuelling such speculations further, China destroyed a defunct weather satellite with a missile in 2007 producing a large amount of space debris. Last year, its researchers successfully tested an anti-satellite robotic device, which can produce a time-controlled, steady explosion with little or no debris.All these unmissably point to how China's space technology is leapfrogging and may soon catch up with the Americans, though not all experts agree. Until now the USA is ahead of China in the space race and is likely to remain so in the coming years. Despite China sending more rockets in 2021, America's total number of satellites and payload capacities in orbit far exceeds those of China. The other advantage Washington enjoys over Beijing is the active role played by a thriving commercial space industry, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin (SpaceX provides internet to Ukraine's forces and Iranian protesters).These facts are, however, of little comfort to Washington as it, along with its allies, is trying to stall or at least slowdown Beijing's progress in every possible way. In 2020, SSC Space Australia (a subsidiary of Swedish Space Corporation) declared that it won't extend the contract for China to use its space tracking station in Western Australia. Beijing, however, has already made alternative arrangements with another such station in Kiribati.The most recent battle in the space war is being fought on the moon, as both nations plan to set up lunar bases for long-term settlements and resource exploitation. In August, NASA's Artemis 3 and CNSA'a Chang'e-7 missions released their lists of potential landing sites only to find that some of them overlap. How they come to an agreement on this issue is yet to be seen.Will it be possible for Washington to stall Beijing's progress in space technology? Is cooperation a more pragmatic choice than competition? Will Washington remove the legal bars that prevent cooperation? Given the successive American administrations' policies towards China (Obama's China containment policy, Trump's trade war, and Biden's chip war), presently that seems unlikely. Meanwhile, China continues its space odyssey as Tiangong's final module is ready to blast off.Dr Sayeed Ahmed is a consulting engineer and the CEO of Bayside Analytix, a technology-focused strategy and management consulting organisation.",2022-10-21

/news/bangladesh/news/housing-secretaries-luxury-the-time-austerity-3148146,Housing for secretaries: Luxury in the time of austerity,"The recent decision to build ""luxurious residences"" at the cost of Tk 42.85 crore for the cabinet and principal secretaries by the housing and public works ministry has drawn flak from different quarters.The widespread criticism comes at a time when people are repeatedly being advised to practise austerity to overcome the current economic crises.Experts say when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina herself has been repeatedly calling for cost cutting and restraint in public expenditure, such an atrociously expensive project funded by taxpayers' money is highly questionable.Former cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, ""I worked as [both] cabinet and principal secretaries, but I never felt the need for swimming pools or these many televisions [which are in the project proposal]. I never felt like I was in a sorry statewithout these.""In the Development Project Proposal (DPP), the Public Works Department, which is the implementing agency, claimed the project will create ""temporary employment opportunities"" during the implementation phase, which will ""help eradicate poverty to some extent"".Meanwhile, people from different quarters took to social media over the last couple of days to blast the initiative.Project documents indicatethe estimated cost of the two three-storey buildings is Tk 18.88 crore. Another Tk 22.5 crore will be spent on the interior and exterior designs and a service building.The Planning Commission, meanwhile, has decided to send the project proposal back to the housing and public works ministry, as it did not follow proper procedure, officials said.The ministry had directly sent the DPP to the physical planning, water supply and housing wing of the commission for approval, whereas it was supposed to be sent to the programming division, said an official, preferring anonymity.""It [the DPP] will now be sent back to the ministry.""According to the proper procedure, the proposal is first supposed to be sent to the programming division, which will then list it as an ""unapproved project"".It will then be sent to physical planning, water supply and housing wing, who will present it before the Project Evaluation Committee.""If the project then gets a nod and the cost is shown to be below Tk 50 crore, it is then presented to the planning minister for approval,"" the official said.Ali Imam Majumder suggested renovating existing residences and earmarking thoseas the homes of the cabinet and principal secretaries.""In terms of improvement, the sky is the limit. But this is not the right time. If their existing residences do not have enough facilities, these can be renovated at a reasonable cost,"" he said, adding that the project should be halted right away.According to the DPP, each of the three-storey building will be built on 18,000 square feetand will cost Tk 21.5 crore.There will be two swimming pools in each, which would cost another estimated Tk 5.1 crore.In the project description, the ministry said there were no permanent residences for the cabinet and principal secretaries.The cabinet secretary currently lives in the official residence in the capital's Minto Road, while the principal secretary's official residence is in Gulshan.A total of 14 LED televisions will be purchased at Tk 900,000 for the proposed homes.As many as 32 CCTV systems will be bought for those at the cost of Tk 600,000, while Tk 1.75 crore will be spent for the fire extinguishing systems.The cost of the 1,000 kg lifts (European Standard) is estimated at Tk 1.55 crore.Moreover, Tk 18 lakh will be spent to conserve rainwater.For official purposes, meeting with diplomats and overall security, there will be separate buildings.Shafiqul Islam, additional chief engineer of the public works department, said, ""They are the top government officials. If they don't deserve such facilities, thenwho does?""It [the project] will not be implemented right now. By the timeit will be, the economic situation will become normal.""Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh, said if the government is respectful to its commitment to transparent and accountable governance, it will be impossible to justifythe project to the public.""The approval of the project will send a message to the people that the government itself is ridiculing the pledges of austerity, and it has no qualms in spending public money to fund the disproportionately luxurious lifestyle of public officials, whose salaries and benefits are borne by the already overburdened common people.""Asked about the logic behind the project at a time like this, an additional secretary of the housing ministry said, ""We don't do anything on our own. We only execute plans that come from the top level.""",2022-10-21

/news/bangladesh/news/energy-economic-crises-they-may-extend-beyond-year-3148066,"Energy, economic crises may drag on beyond a year: CPD","The economic and energy crises that Bangladesh is facing may extend beyond a year, the Centre for Policy Dialogue said yesterday.The measures the government has taken to ride out these crises -- dollar crunch, energy shortfall, food insecurity, and soaring inflation -- are mostly on the right path. But they are inadequate and short-term in nature while the problems are likely to persist for the medium term, it noted.To overcome the crises, the independent think-tank recommended cost-effective production and employment-oriented measures, and also called for focusing on spending in areas that will benefit the poor.It suggested the government form a committee to monitor the key economic indicators and come up with policy advice and actions to tackle the growing crises.The committee will be comprised of representatives from the Prime Minister's Office, the ministries of finance, planning, commerce, power and energy, food, and agriculture as well as civil society members.The CPD yesterday unveiled its review on the challenges the country's economy is facing amid a global economic slowdown.""We are not going to get rid of the problems even in 2023. One cannot expect we will be free from these crises within the next one year,"" CPD Executive Director Fahmida Khatun told a press briefing at its office in the city.The nature of the current crises is global, and the world economy is adversely impacted by the challenges stemming from inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Covid pandemic.Mentioning that some domestic problems aggravated the crises in Bangladesh, she noted that the country's internal policies and plans should be strong, corruption removed and good governance ensured.All countries are facing the heat of the current global crisis but the ones whose internal policies are strong will fare better, she said.Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the CPD, said, ""The government has taken some steps to overcome the crises, considering them as short-term. We, however, are facing medium and long-term crises… if the problems are not addressed properly, they may lead to a job crisis and then to a political crisis.""Replying to a query, he said the government can take long-term loans from the International Monetary Fund or abroad to expand the fiscal space. The use of funds, however, should be proper.If funds are misused and capital is siphoned off abroad, the country will face even deeper problems, he pointed out.Had the government taken reform measures when the economy was in a better shape, it could have got more fiscal space and been in a better position to handle the situation.""But it [the government] spent over Tk 26,000 crore in the name of capacity charge for power companies in the last fiscal year… Many of the owners of those companies became rich but the government's fiscal space shrank.""Answering a question on food security, Moazzem said the food-importing countries will be in trouble if they face dollar shortage.Moreover, the government should focus on increasing food production and storage capacity, as food is now becoming a ""political commodity"" globally.""Agricultural subsidies should rise,"" he added.About the recent price hike, the CPD said the poor and low-income earners are facing increased hardship, as the living cost has been soaring since the spread of Covid in early 2020.These people continue to struggle because the burden of rising prices weighs more heavily on their meagre incomes.It is urgent to revisit and revise the minimum wages of workers in all industries immediately, according to the CPD.Private companies should consider a higher salary increment for all their employees to help them maintain their living standards.About the energy crisis, the think-tank said the power and energy sector is suffering the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war and the pandemic. Factories are not getting enough gas and electricity to carry on production as usual.The industries, especially gas-dependent textile, ceramics, glass, and steel factories, are struggling to meet the production targets.Recently, oil-exporting countries decided to cut oil production, which may put more pressure on Bangladesh since it is heavily dependent on imported petroleum.Based on a calculation, the CPD said Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation has been making profits since August.The BPC should revise down the fuel prices to help reduce inflationary pressure on the domestic market, the think-tank said, adding that Bangladesh took mitigation and adaptation measures to reduce energy use but hasn't given enough attention to renewables-based power generation.Falling forex reserves continue to be a cause for concern as it depleted to $36.3 billion as of October 12 due to high import bills and slow growth in remittance earnings. It was $41.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2021-22, the CPD said.It recommended ensuring market-based floating exchange rate to help improve the situation.",2022-10-21
