/nrb/news/bangladeshi-expat-found-dead-malaysia-11-days-after-abduction-3137411,Bangladeshi expat found dead  in Malaysia 11 days after abduction,"The decomposed body of Sohel Mia, a Bangladeshi expatriate in Malaysia, was recovered yesterday 11 days after his abduction.Sohel's body was found from the forest behind a factory on Road Number 10 of Taming Jaya Industry Park, Selangor state, 30 km from the capital Kuala Lumpur yesterday (October 6, 2022).Bangladesh High Commission in Malaysia and expatriate relatives of Sohel confirmed the development.Sohel (39), son of late Ahmed Miah of South Dhalapara village in Ghatail upazila of Tangail, had been living in Malaysia for 15 years. He used to work in a factory in Malaysia.""The body was partially decomposed and the victim's hands and face were tied with tape,"" said Mohammad Zaid Hasan, assistant commissioner of Kajang's OCPD.Sohel's body was recovered based on confessional statements given by four expatriate Bangladeshis, who were arrested in connection with the abduction, he said.Kajang police launched the operation after a complaint was lodged by Sohel's maternal uncle Mizan.Mizan identified Sohel after the body was brought to Sardang Hospital this (October 7, 2022) morning. The body has been kept at the hospital for autopsy.Around 9pm (local time) on September 25, Sohel Mia was abducted from his home in Tamiljaya area of Kuala Lumpur. On September 27, his family sent Tk 500,000 to the abductors as ransom through a bank branch in Barishal, Bangladesh, as the abductors ""threatened to kill"" him.Sohel's family filed two cases in Malaysia and one in Bangladesh as he was not released.According to Kajang police, two Bangladeshis were arrested from Beranong area on October 5 and two more from Semenihe area the next day on suspicion of involvement in the incident.The names of Mamun Shikder and Alamgir have been revealed, but the police did not reveal the names of the remaining two for the sake of investigation.On October 4, Rapid action battalion arrested a man named Nasir Uddin (38) from Barguna with ransom money after a kidnapping case was filed by Sohel's relative Billal Hossain with Ghatail Police Station in Tangail. On October 5, a Tangail court court sent Nasir to jail.Bangladesh High Commissioner to Malaysia Md Golam Sarwar expressed regret over the incident and said arrangements will be made to bring all involved in the abduction and murder of Sohel Mia, to book. ."

We were talking in my office, when he noticed Nurul and asked if he is 'Nurul Afsar',"" he described.""When Nurul answered in the affirmative, the man said he was actually from the law enforcement agency and that there was a case against Nurul in Banshkhali and he was here to detain him.""The man did not show any identification, but soon another man wearing a black polo shirt and an ID card, with 'Rab' written on it, sashayed into my office.""In one CCTV footage, the man can be seen entering the office and walking up the stairs at 2:48pm.It further shows that he has a short beard and slightly long hair, and wore black pants. Another man in a grey polo shirt kept guard under the staircase while others climbed up the stairs.The man walking up the stairs was accompanied by another in a grey polo shirt.According to the footage, they were preceded by three more men wearing grey, blue and black chequered shirts.Footage from another camera, which was facing the gate, shows six men entering the compound around 2:47pm.Nurul was brought out of the office at 2:55pm, flanked by men in grey polos. The man in the black shirt followed.There was also another bearded man in a black polo shirt and light blue jeans in the footage.As Nurul was taken away, footage from 2:56pm shows the older man, who initially identified himself as a client, walking out with Khairul, and another staffer of the real estate office called Tareq.The man shook Khairul's and Tareq's hands, and bid them farewell before the group left in a grey microbus and a black Pajero.  ""When leaving, he [the man in black] said 'we have been saved from a big misfortune',"" said Khairul.""We asked where Nurul was being taken. We were in turn asked to ask questions at court in a day.""Since then, there has been no trace of Nurul.Around 8:00pm that day, another team claiming to be from Rab-1, visited the office.This time they went to collect all the footages and corresponding devices.""They showed ID cards but did not give us enough time to read the names. [I saw] One card had 'Rab' written on it. They took away our entire security system, saying we would get it back. We have not yet,"" said Khairul.Lablu, nephew of Nurul, said his uncle had spent seven years in Malaysia before returning to Bangladesh around one and a half years ago.""His father, who is my grandfather, had developed Leukaemia. His mother had died when he was abroad, so he did not want to take a risk this time [and came back to the country].""Nurul's family lives in Satkhira's Ashashuni and he is unmarried.The family said they visited the Turag Police Station on September 26 to file a case, but was told by the duty officer that they could not do so because he was picked up by men identifying themselves as law enforcers.""The duty officers said Nurul must have been taken for some investigation and will be returned once that is done.""Khandaker Al Moin, media wing director of Rab, said that no one by the name of Nurul Afsar was taken into custody to his knowledge.Nurul's brother Abul Kashem Hawladar, in a statement to journalists in Satkhira, said, ""If he [Nurul] has committed any crime, arrest him according to the law. Do not force him into disappearance.""In a similar incident, one Dilwar Hossain was picked up from Bosila on September 19 and shown arrested on September 27. He was then charged with terrorism."

Turning to the bilateral relationship, Momen noted that the high-level visits of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to Thailand in 2013 and the visits to Bangladesh of Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhom in 2011 and 2018 made significant contributions toward further cementing the friendship between the two nations.""We look forward to maintaining the momentum in our bilateral relations through more such high-level engagements in the coming days,"" Momen said.He urged the private sectors to create stronger synergies in order to tap into the unutilized potentials for the mutual benefit of our two robust economies.Since establishment of diplomatic ties, the bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Thailand have flourished steadily.""The solid foundations of our bilateral relations today have truly paved the way for our centenary celebrations and beyond in future,"" Momen said.He prayed for the continued peace, progress and prosperity of the friendly peoples of Bangladesh and Thailand.The foreign minister said Bangladesh-Thailand relations are rooted in strong civilizational, cultural, linguistic and spiritual bonds.The two countries have extensive people-to-people contacts as people travel often for tourism, medical treatment, business and education purposes.""As a close neighbour and BIMSTEC partner, Bangladesh attaches special importance to her relations with Thailand,"" Momen said.He also said Bangladesh considers Thailand an inspiration for socioeconomic development.""We look forward to Thailand's continued cooperation and collaboration for our transformation to a knowledge-based developed economy under Vision- 2041,"" Momen said.He added, ""Both of our countries have significant potentials to evolve as facilitators of greater connectivity between South Asia and South East Asia.""Diplomats stationed in Dhaka, political leaders, business leaders, journalists, civil society members were present."
/sports/cricket/news/tigers-begin-bangla-wash-t20i-tri-nation-series-defeat-3137311,Tigers begin ‘Bangla Wash T20I Tri-nation Series’ with defeat,"Bangladesh's fragile batting lineup was once again exposed as the Tigers failed to chase a challenging total, suffering a 21-run defeat against Pakistan in the 'Bangla Wash T20I Tri-nation Series' opener at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Friday. A 50-run third-wicket stand between Liton Das and Afif Hossain and some lusty blows at the death from Yasir Ali were the highlights in batting for the Tigers. Despite Yasir's unbeaten 21-ball 42, Bangladesh were restricted to 146 for eight while in chase of a challenging 168-run target.   Chasing a challenging total, the Tigers lost both their openers Mehedi Hasan Miraz and Sabbir Rahman inside the Powerplay. The makeshift opening duo could amount to just 25 runs. Miraz was the first one to fall, holing out to the fielder at deep square leg off a Mohammad Wasim delivery in the fifth over. Sabbir followed suit, departing in the very next over to leave the Tigers at a precarious 37 for two after 5.5 overs. Afif and Liton showed intent as they scored some valuable runs in the middle. Liton, in particular, looked to be in good touch, smashing a total of four boundaries and a beautifully timed straight six off leggie Shadab Khan during his 26-ball 35-run knock. Things went downhill for the Tigers once Liton departed to a Mohammad Nawaz delivery in the 13th over. Mosaddek Hossain was trapped in front by Nawaz the very next ball as Bangladesh found themselves at 87 for four after 12.4 overs. With the required rate going above 11 an over, Bangladesh could never bounce back as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Yasir's five boundaries and two maximums at the death on way to his career-best T20I score only helped Bangladesh reduce the margin of defeat.  Earlier, Mohammad Rizwan continued his excellent form with the willow as he struck an unbeaten 78 to help Pakistan post a challenging 167 for five.

/tech-startup/news/beginners-guide-graphics-cards-3137076,A beginner’s guide to graphics cards,"We often hear the term 'graphics cards' being thrown around. If you're into high-spec gaming, you should be well-versed with the concept, but those who aren't into building pc or graphics-related work might not be as familiar. If you were ever curious about understanding the ins and outs of graphics cards, here are some key components to keep in mind.A graphics card, sometimes also called a video card, is a piece of computer hardware that is used to process graphics-related data. Processing this kind of data allows a clear display of images and videos with attention to detail. Computer motherboards generally come with this ability but the added graphics card allows more focus and clarity on the processed visual output. Graphics cards provide designated Random Access Memory (RAM) and a processor to process video and graphics-related data. As a result, the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the regular RAM do not take up a load of processing intense amounts of graphical data. Similar to the CPU, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is integrated within the graphics card body and does all the graphical data processing. After processing the data it makes an image clearer to see details, especially allowing the viewing of 3D images with a higher pixel ratio and helping with colour accuracy. This also makes rasterizing images faster, i.e. converting the data of an image into pixels to be shown on the screen. In short, the GPU provides an output closest to reality. A regular graphics card can process data up to a speed of Megahertz (MHz). For example, a 2.5 MHz GPU can reach up to 25,00,000 cycles per second.  But the current generation dwells in Gigahertz (GHz).  This means a 1.5 GHz GPU can reach up to 150,00,00,000 cycles per second. This measurement in cycles means the components can process data back and forth, as the input to output process constitutes a cycle. This is commonly understood as clock speed. Graphics cards also tend to have their dedicated RAM, called video RAM (VRAM). The amount of VRAM in a graphics card indicates how much space it has to process an amount of data. For example, a graphics card with a 1.6 GHz GPU and 12 GB VRAM can easily process 6 GB of graphical data without hassle. Video games and graphics software usually come with a VRAM requirement. Video games requiring 8 GB VRAM means that to operate smoothly, the graphics card needs 8 GB VRAM dedicated to that game when running.The Basic Input Output System (BIOS) determines how fast the hardware initialises when started. The video BIOS is the same. When loading a video game or rendering an image, how fast the hardware initialises or responds is determined by the video BIOS. Currently, graphics cards come with Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) BIOS extension, allowing faster initialisation that is more precise than regular BIOS.As for output ports, graphics cards come with multiple High Definition Multimedia Interfaces (HDMI) ports, display ports and Digital Visual Interface (DVI) ports. The ports support HDMI, DVI and regular display cables. Being a graphical processing unit, graphics cards tend to get heated - thus requiring a dedicated cooling system. Older generations used to come with heat sinks. Usually, a graphics card comes with at least two fans for cooling. But in a powerful graphics card, two fans are not enough. For example, if a two-fan graphics card were to have a 1.6 GHz GPU and 12 GB VRAM, it would overheat and fry up, due to the graphics card processing 10 GB of graphical data per second. This amount of oscillations or cycles would generate intense heat, resulting in insufficient cooling. So, for something with a 1.65 GHz GPU and 12 GB VRAM, a triple fan setup is a must. In some instances, modifying it with a liquid cooling system works quite well too.While all graphics cards may seem the same at first, closer inspection will reveal that different types serve different purposes, especially when catered toward gaming and/or professional work. For gaming graphics, cards are made more robust, with cloud gaming requiring specific builds. Ones meant for video editing or 3D modelling are more performance-oriented. Gaming cards are high-end versions of graphics cards. They are mostly performance intensive and their focus is on the output, meaning they will have more clock speed in comparison to VRAM. These graphics cards will have a GPU of 1.5 to 1.8 GHz but a VRAM of 8 GB, which is usually the minimum requirement for gaming. More clock speed is needed to run games at full potential, as video games are more output oriented. For example, to run a video game at 4k resolution and 60 FPS (frames per second), a graphics card would need about 1.8 GHz GPU and 10 GB VRAM. The 1.8GHz GPU is powerful enough to process the 4K graphics at 60 FPs. Some video game-specific graphics card line-ups are GeForce GTX, GeForce RTX Nvidia, Titan Radeon and HD Radeon RX.Workstation graphics cards serve the opposite function of gaming ones. Because workstations need storage, graphics cards that are focused on processing graphical data like video editing, photo editing and 3D modelling will have more VRAM than clock speed. In this case, a graphics card can get away with 2.6 MHz GPU and 16 GB VRAM, creating a video whose final output will be 250 MB and will have a raw file of 1 GB. This is because that file will work with multiple raw footage of 150 MB each, with animation summing up to 60 MB. So when working with this amount of data, more space is needed over power, as the amount to process is more than the power required to process data. As such, these graphics cards are more focused on VRAM. Some workstation-specific graphics card series are Nvidia Quadro, AMD FirePro, Radeon Pro, Cloud Workstation, Nvidia Tesla and AMD FireStream."

His 41-ball blitz also included 10 boundaries.Glenn Maxwell was run out for one but David's whirlwind cameo ensured there was no respite for the tourists.Singapore-born David smashed Obed McCoy for two sixes and two fours before missing the fifth ball, a full toss, to be lbw in the eventful 17th over.West Indies applied the brake in the last three overs, conceding only 21 runs, but still fell short of the target.Beginning on Sunday, Australia play three T20 matches against England before beginning their World Cup campaign versus New Zealand on Oct. 22.

But the law enforcers, instead of giving them the support they sought, brutally tortured them.The allegations were made by the family of Godadhar Malo, a 68-year-old farmer of Majhipara area of Dhaka's Dhamrai upazila.He filed a case with Dhamrai Police Station on June 18, accusing five to six unnamed individuals of entering his house and taking away cash, gold jewellery, and other valuables.About a month later, the Detective Branch of police got the charge to investigate the case, and on September 6, the officers asked Godadhar's daughter-in-law Shyamoli Haldar Rupa and her 14-year-old son Diganta Halder to go to the office of Dhaka District (north) DB in Savar.Rupa, 35, alleged that when she and her eighth grader son went there, the officers tortured her for three days in custody and her son for one day.""The DB officers beat me mercilessly and forced me to say I was involved in the robbery,"" the mother of two told The Daily Star on September 14 when she was still being treated at Manikganj Sadar Hospital for what she said were the injuries she received in the DB office.""An officer with a long beard and a female officer hit me more times than anyone else did.

So I said whatever they wanted me to say,"" she told this correspondent.She was later able to identify the bearded officer as Inspector Yasin Munshi.She added that her family members had to give the DB officers Tk 1.50 lakh in bribes for her release on September 9.Godadhar, who filed the robbery case, yesterday said, ""My daughter-in-law and grandson were detained and brutally tortured at the DB office for no reason. I want justice for this.""Contacted, Dhaka district (north) DB Sub-Inspector Sheikh Farid, who is investigating the robbery case, and Inspector Yasin Munshi refuted all the allegations.""Rupa is staging a drama. She coordinated the robbery due to a family feud,"" Farid said.After the robbery case was filed on June 18, Arafat Uddin, sub-inspector of Dhamrai Police Station, was assigned to investigate the case.Police then detained a local man as a possible suspect and released him two days later, said Arafat, who was transferred to Dhaka's Keraniganj Model Police Station recently.Godadhar's younger son Shyamol Halder said he, Rupa, Diganta and a relative named Kirton Halder, went to the DB office on September 6.Sub-Inspector Farid, Inspector Kamal Hossain, a woman officer, and another cop then started interrogating Rupa. ""They physically and mentally tortured Rupa Boudi [sister-in-law] for almost 12 hours straight.""We were sitting right outside the room. We heard the DB officers continuously hurling abuse at her. They threatened to beat Diganta if she did not say that she was involved in the robbery. Boudi was screaming loudly.""Around midnight, the DB officers put Rupa and Diganta on a white microbus and left the premises.""Boudi could not even walk to the vehicle without help because of the severe torture,"" said Shyamol.A few hours later, the microbus returned with them, along with two schoolboys from Dhamrai's Boronalai village, he said.""Then, the DB officers took Boudi and Diganta to the interrogation room again and tortured them.""He added that the DB released Diganta and the two boys in the afternoon on September 7 and kept Rupa and Kirton in detention.""We could not get them released despite repeated attempts throughout the night of September 7,"" said Shyamol.On September 8, Shyamol and several other family members met Md Asaduzzaman, the superintendent of Dhaka district police, and told him what was happening, he said.Advised by Asaduzzaman, the family then met Mobashera Habib Khan, additional SP (DB) of Dhaka district.""Mobashera asked the DB officers to appear at her office with Rupa. When they did, Mobashera scolded the DB officers for torturing Boudi.""But Mobashera later asked Rupa not to withdraw her confessional statement, saying that she could only be released if she did so, Shyamol said.Later that night, DB officers raided Rupa's in-law's home in Dhamrai and her father's home in Manikganj's Singair in the name of recovering the valuables the robbers took away.""But they found nothing,"" said Shyamol, adding that the DB team arrested Rupa's relative Jibon during the raid.On September 9, Shyamol along with his father Godadhar and Rupa's husband Kamol Halder went to Savar DB office. The DB officers took signatures from all of them on blank papers, he alleged.Then, the DB officers forced all of them to say that Rupa was not tortured in custody and filmed their statements, alleged Shyamol.Around midday, Rupa was released from the DB office. The family had to take her to the Manikganj Sadar Hospital for treatment, he said.But Kirton and Jibon were sent to jail on September 10, said Shyamol. ""Kirton was also tortured in custody,"" he said, adding that Kirton was released on bail on October 4.DB Inspector Kamal Hossain said Kirton and Jibon confessed to a court that Rupa masterminded the robbery.""Rupa and her son were just interrogated. No one tortured them,"" he claimed.Dhaka district SP Md Asaduzzaman also refuted the allegations of torture.Police interrogated Rupa after two accused in their confessions mentioned that she was involved in the robbery, he said.""There is no question of torturing her. I do not know why she is making the allegations of torture so late,"" he said.""She could have come to me. If her allegations were true, I would have taken necessary actions,"" Asaduzzaman said.Additional SP Mobashera Habib Khan did not respond to calls and messages."

/business/economy/news/loan-write-declines-3137086,Loan write-off declines,"Loans written off by banks in Bangladesh declined in the first half of 2022 despite the upward trend of default loans. As per the rules, banks have to keep 100 per cent provisioning against delinquent assets and the coverage has to come from operating profits.So, many banks show reluctance in writing off loans, which goes on to explain why the volume of sour loans has not fallen substantially.The outstanding amount of write-off loans stood at Tk 43,360 crore in June this year in contrast to Tk 44,083 crore six months ago, data from the Bangladesh Bank showed. It amounted to Tk 43,543 crore in June last year.Usually, loans are written off when they are entirely covered by cash and there is no realistic prospect of recovering them. These assets are shifted to off-balance sheet records.But banks are not cleaning up their balance sheets despite the escalation in non-performing loans (NPLs): defaulted loans hit an all-time high of Tk 125,257 crore in June, an increase of 26.3 per cent from Tk 99,205 crore a year prior.NPLs accounted for 8.96 per cent of the total outstanding loans of Tk 13,98,592 crore as of June.One of the reasons many banks ignore tidying up their balance sheets by writing off loans is to enjoy a higher net profit, a central bank official explains.A majority of banks managed a hefty profit in the January to June half this year thanks to the recent rebound of businesses from the coronavirus pandemic and the fluctuation of the exchange rate of the taka against the US dollar. Still, many showed unwillingness to remove the bad loans from the balance sheets.Lenders are allowed to show 50 per cent of the collateral as provisions against default loans. This means banks can avoid keeping the 100 per cent mandatory cash provision against NPLs.As per BB regulations, banks have to maintain provisioning of 0.25 per cent to 5 per cent for unclassified loans. It is 20 per cent for the default loans of the substandard category, 50 per cent for the doubtful category, and 100 per cent for the bad or loss category.Banks have to keep a full amount in cash in provision for the NPLs that are written off.Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, says the banks that enjoy sound financial health usually write off NPLs.""Although writing off bad debts helps them clean up their balance sheets, maintaining a 100 per cent cash provision is difficult for many banks.""Banks recovered Tk 565 crore through writing off loans between January and June compared to Tk 225 crore in the identical first half of 2021, bringing down the outstanding amount of write-off loans.Since the facility was introduced in Bangladesh in 2003, a total of Tk 60,402 crore has been written off. Of the sum, Tk 43,360 crore has remained unrealised.The amount of funds that was recovered through the process increased substantially in the first half of 2022, which Rahman described as a positive development for the banking sector.The enhanced recovery has helped reduce the outstanding amount of the write-off loans as well.Although the provision base has expanded to some extent, there is still a large provisioning shortfall in the banking sector of Bangladesh.The provision deficit stood at Tk 13,219 crore in June in contrast to Tk 14,007 crore six months earlier.Mohammad Ali, additional managing director of Pubali Bank, also said keeping 100 per cent provisioning is difficult for the weak banks. ""The capacity of writing off loans is not the same for every bank.""Shah Md Ahsan Habib, a professor of the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management, said writing off bad loans is not always bad.""It also shows how much of soured loans a bank can absorb. It is a matter of decision as well.""""We need to check and analyse data before concluding on the association between increasing NPLs and decreasing loans write-off,"" he added.Anis A Khan, a veteran banker, sees the fall of the write-off loans as a good sign.""This means that banks' efforts to recover bad loans have paid off to some extent.""    "

Some members of senior group rebuked members of the junior groups including Ramzan for smoking in front of them which led to the attack on Rakib."
/opinion/views/interviews/news/energy-prices-should-be-consciously-regulated-the-government-3137126,Energy prices should be consciously regulated by the government,"Dr MM Akash, professor at the Department of Economics of Dhaka University, talks to Eresh Omar Jamal of The Daily Star about the ongoing inflation in the country, as well as the role of the government and trade syndicates in it.Despite the global rise in energy prices, Bangladesh has at times seen disproportionately higher prices in comparison. But when global prices dropped, we did not see the energy prices here go down. Why is that?Most of the markets are not regulated by the government directly, but the price for energy, since it is a strategic commodity like, let's say, food products, is actually politically sensitive and therefore must be consciously regulated and/or monitored by any government. For example, in Bangladesh, energy prices should be determined by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) through a transparent tripartite meeting of all stakeholders, after conducting detailed public hearings about the real cost of energy supply, including the international buying price, freight charges, tariff, and internal transportation cost, taking into consideration a reasonable profit margin, etc. But this institutional price mechanism has been violated and the Consumer Association of Bangladesh (CAB) has lodged a legal suit against the ministry and BERC in the recent past.So, prices – of LNG, electricity, petroleum, gas, diesel, etc – have become subjected to a ""cat and mouse"" game that has been going on among BERC, CAB, and the concerned ministry. Sometimes, BERC yields to vested interests, other times CAB goes to court, and sometimes, using the indemnity ordinance for the energy sector or for so-called ""urgent reasons,"" the ministry determines and announces the prices through an administrative order.People have been experiencing tremendous inflationary pressure for some time now. Has the government done enough over the past couple of years to support them? How could it have been done better?
One measure taken for controlling essential commodity prices by the government in urban areas is the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) outlets that were selling necessities at lower prices. The long lines and the fact that even middle-class people are now standing in them prove that what the TCB supplied was not enough, and that it was just a temporary measure.
The popular demand is for rationing or cash expenditure support to target people who cannot afford what they need to consume. But some privileged groups enjoy rations and other indirect advantages. In rural areas, vulnerable groups also have access to such facilities. But the system should be made universal. A rational system will have to be built to ensure minimum food security (rice, lentil, sugar, cooking oil, etc) for low-income groups – that may then show and prove the goodwill of the government in this regard.
On the one hand, we see farmers struggling to earn enough from farming. On the other hand, we see prices of agricultural products increasing. Why do we see such discrepancies, and who is benefitting from them?



The markets for our agricultural products at the producer level are highly competitive and there are numerous sellers of surplus products. They do not have staying power, modern marketing connections or storage facilities. So they greatly depend on middlemen to connect them to the retail market at the consumer end. It is the middlemen that are benefitting.

Trade syndicates artificially pushing prices up has plagued our country for years.

In the case of imported products, the syndicate of sellers is very strong and it controls wholesale prices. As you have noted correctly, trade syndicates artificially pushing prices up has continued to plague our country for years. The issue is whether the government has been able to identify those syndicates, and if it did really take effective measures to break them up by applying competition laws against them.

However, the Bangladesh Competition Commission has filed numerous cases against many large companies. I think we must wait and see whether this time any real punishment or fine or tax is charged against their monopoly to make super profits.

But for a permanent solution, the TCB must have an adequate, say, one-third of the total supply as a buffer stock for all selected necessary items – imported or locally-produced.
TCB also must have an attached network of small suppliers all over the country, so that price intervention through open market sale (OMS) can be resorted to at any time and in any place, whenever the strong syndicates try to raise prices by creating an artificial supply deficit or import crisis.
This long-term solution was preached in the taskforce reports of Prof Rehman Sobhan in the 1990s, when politicians were still not following the so-called ""mukto bazaar orthoniti"" (free market economics) – when business syndicates were not as strong as they are now, and when bureaucrats and politicians still had a pro-people vision or manifesto before them.

/opinion/letters/news/plug-the-brain-drain-3137416,Plug the brain drain,"As a developing country, Bangladesh is a victim of brain drain. Generally, this issue is more prevalent among students who have access to higher education abroad. Although a large number of students migrate abroad for higher studies every year, the rate of return is declining alarmingly. According to UNESCO's ""Global Flow of Tertiary-Level Students"" report, 60,390 Bangladeshi students were pursuing higher studies abroad in 2017. This number is increasing at the rate of 10 percent every year. Most of them are settling permanently in those countries after completing their studies.In our country, the idea of living abroad permanently is viewed as something prestigious. The potential of Bangladesh becoming an incompetent nation is not visible to most people. Besides high salaries, developed countries ensure a more secure life. These facilities are still inadequate in our country.The inconsistency of the education system in Bangladesh and the inability to ensure world-class education is one of the reasons behind brain drain. When a research enthusiast realises that his/her lifelong dream cannot be fulfilled in their own country, he/she will naturally want to go abroad. According to the annual report of the University Grants Commission (UGC), 125 public and private universities of the country altogether spent only Tk 153 crore on research activities in 2019, which is only one percent of their total expenditure.Rich nations are also indirectly luring talented people from less-developed and developing countries to contribute to their own development. But it would be foolish to view Bangladesh's brain drain only through the few reasons mentioned above. Firstly, we must understand exactly which factors are discouraging a highly educated person from settling permanently in their homeland.State policymakers need to think about issues related to quality of life, employment opportunities, social structure, financial security, development, gender equality, and freedom of all walks of life. After all, a state can only become full of opportunities with the contribution of its most skilled people.Syed Rifat, Jagannath University

/opinion/editorial/news/it-still-accident-if-death-caused-systemic-negligence-3137306,Is it still an accident if death is caused by systemic negligence? ,"That residents of any modern capital city could be exposed to accidents related to septic tanks or uncleaned sewerage lines is quite unthinkable. Yet, this is what the residents of Dhaka are being exposed to everyday. On November 11, a 40-year-old woman, who worked as a cleaner at a car showroom, lost one of her legs when, while returning from work, three slabs of a manhole suddenly blew up around 15 to 16 feet high and fell on her. Needless to say, her life, since then, has been an overwhelming struggle.In the last several years, a number of such events have hogged the headlines. For example, on March 27, 2018, a septic tank blast in the capital's Pallabi area led to the death of a three-year-old while also leaving four others critically injured. On November 30, 2015, at least five members of a family sustained burn injuries in a septic tank blast in Dakkhinkhan's Faridabad area.According to experts, residents of Dhaka are being exposed to such risks because many of the city's sewerage lines are not maintained properly, and some were not even constructed following proper designs. Adding to its long list of failures, the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) has also failed to bring the whole city under one sewerage network. Thus, residents in many areas were either forced to set up septic tanks or connect their sewage lines with storm water drains.As of last year, 71 percent of household latrines in the city were directly or indirectly open to drains, eventually discharging wastes into the city's lakes and canals. Meanwhile, Dhaka's septic tank soak pits have also not been working properly because of their low capacity for soil infiltration. The culmination of all these and other factors has led to a situation where people are constantly exposed to such freak accidents. However, can such incidents really be called ""accidents"" when it is the apathy of the authorities that causes them? According to a report by this newspaper, Wasa prepared a 15-year sewerage master plan in 2015 to bring 100 percent of its areas under the sewerage network. However, only one among the proposed five sewerage treatment plants is now near completion.How long will people have to wait for Wasa to get such a basic service done right? How many more people will have to lose their limbs or lives before Wasa officials are held accountable for failing to properly maintain sewerage lines? It is embarrassing to hear our government officials constantly boast about our development achievements when our sewerage system – the most basic element of any liveable city – is in such shambles.We call on the government to urgently hold relevant officials accountable for these failures. It is unacceptable for anyone to be at constant risk of injury or death simply because of the negligence of Wasa."

He has a little problem with his calf but he will be back to training on Sunday,"" Galtier told a news conference on Friday.There are more injury woes for PSG as fullback Nuno Mendes will be out of action for three weeks with a muscle injury while Kylian Mbappe is suffering from a throat infection.The France forward, however, is expected to be included in the squad, Galtier said, though he could be on the bench, allowing 20-year-old Hugo Ekitike to be handed another start.Unbeaten PSG lead the standings with 25 points from nine games, two ahead of second-placed Olympique de Marseille, who host bottom side AC Ajaccio on Saturday.Galtier said he would stick to the usual defensive system when asked if he would change his three-man central defence to a steadier four-man backline in light of injuries to Mendes and Presnel Kimpembe, who is still out with a hamstring injury.""I'm not going to change the system, especially because we do not have much time to work, having come back from Lisbon yesterday morning at 6am,"" he explained.After coming under fire for their alleged excessive use of planes to travel to Ligue 1 games, PSG will this time travel by bus for the 150km journey to Reims, Galtier added.

/sports/cricket/news/wickets-the-middle-cost-us-3137351,‘Wickets in the middle cost us’,"Bangladesh stand-in skipper Nurul Hasan Sohan found the bowling department to be adequate but cautioned that they needed to improve following their 21-run loss to Pakistan today in the opening match of the tri-nation T20I series at Christchurch, also involving hosts New Zealand.Pakistan lost a few wickets following Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan's opening stand and the second-wicket partnership between Rizwan and Shan Masood but were able to score freely in the death overs against Mustafizur Rahman and Hasan Mahmud -- the duo conceding 90 runs between them in eight overs -- as Rizwan finished on an unbeaten 78 off 50 deliveries to take Pakistan to 167 for 5.Liton Das was batting well on 35 but then the Tigers lost four wickets in a hurry between the 13th and the 15th over as their chase fell away. Yasir Ali smashed an unbeaten 42 off 21 to take Tigers to 146 for 8.Despite the bowling performance that saw Pakistan put on a healthy score, Nurul was overall impressed.""We are disappointed. The wicket was good and the bowlers did well. We need to improve in a few areas though.""Wickets in the middle while batting cost us. Litton and Yasir batted well, but as I said, we need to improve there,"" Sohan, who captained the side as Shakib Al Hasan did not take the field after arriving yesterday in New Zealand, said during the post-match presentations.""Taskin bowled really well and we needed that but we should improve for the next match and World Cup as well,"" he added.Player of the match Rizwan, who anchored the Pakistan innings, said: ""We keep things simple. It was a good batting track, we thought we were 10-15 short despite playing well. Some of the boundaries are big here. But we are playing the ball on the merit. Without a plan, it becomes difficult.""Bangladesh will play New Zealand in their second game on Sunday, hoping their pace attack can bounce back while also expecting that Shakib can change their fortunes with a bit of inspiration in the next game."
