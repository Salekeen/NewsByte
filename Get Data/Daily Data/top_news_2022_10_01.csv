/weekend-read/news/discovery-may-save-bara-katra-3132221,A discovery that may save Bara Katra,"An exciting new discovery by researchers has raised the hope of saving one of the most important heritage sites of Dhaka – the Bara Katra, a Mughal-era palace built for a prince and later turned into an inn for travellers.The historic stone inscription discovered by Committee for Commissioning Books on Architecture (Dhakar Sthapotto Bishoyok Grontho Pronoyon Committee) is the only testament of ownership of Bara Katra, an ancient site that has been left in neglect and at the mercy of those occupying it.The organisation stumbled upon this precious artefact while researching ancient stone and copper inscriptions found in Dhaka. The stone inscription was found in Bangladesh National Museum and, after examining it, the researchers realised that it was the original stone inscription on the north gate of the palace.During the Mughal era, Bara Katra was used as the caravanserai for travellers and merchants. However, its occupants changed over time. Some of the subadars of the late Mughal era also resided in this palace. 


During the Mughal era, Bara Katra was used as the caravanserai for travellers and merchants. However, its occupants changed over time. Some of the subadars of the late Mughal era also resided in this palace. The inscription clearly declares Bara Katra and the 22 shops adjacent to the palace as 'waqf' property.Waqf property is an inalienable charitable endowment under Islamic law. Eminent architectural historian and president of Arch Asia, a representative body of Asian architects, Professor Dr Abu Sayeed M Ahmed said, ""According to the law, waqf property can never be owned by any individual. The stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra testifies that Bara Katra is in no way a private property.""However, the current occupants of Bara Katra are claiming that they are owners of this historic place.According to the Committee's research, renowned author, researcher and chronicler Hakim Habibur Rahman obtained the historic stone inscription at the end of the British Raj era. However, Rahman and his son never revealed anything about this precious collection before handing it over to the national museum.""The committee has identified the historic stone inscription as a part of its research work. The committee has further discovered four stone inscriptions about Dhaka currently stored in different museums which were also considered lost,"" Professor Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique, chairman of the committee and former vice chancellor of Dhaka University, told The Daily Star.A team of researchers led by Mawlana Muhammad Nuruddin Fatehpuri identified these lost artefacts and deciphered the Arabic, Persian and Urdu inscriptions.According to sources, two stone inscriptions were attached to Bara Katra's two main gates. The inscription on the southern gate stated the year of its construction and the northern gate's inscription was about the endowment of the property.While the northern gate has become dilapidated, the southern gate of Bara Katra remains comparatively intact.There is a 18-line poetry written in Nastaliq script in the stone inscription that mentions the construction year of the palace. The inscription was engraved in 18 different black stone tablets which were attached around the dome of the southern gate of the palace.The stone inscription of the northern gate of the palace was written in prose, in Tughra script. In this script, Abul Qashim Al Hussaini Attabatayi Assemani is named as the architect of the palace.The transliteration and translation of the stone inscription of the northern gate were first published in Charles D'Oyly's book 'Antiquities of Dhaka' in 1822.While the stone inscription was in the national museum, it was assumed that it was lost. The fragmented pieces of it were preserved in two wooden frames separately, preventing researchers from deciphering them. Renowned historian Syed Muhammed Taifoor published a book titled 'Glimpses of Old Dhaka' in 1956 where he stated that the stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra was lost. Other historians, referring to Taifoor have also confirmed that the inscription was lost.As part of discovering Dhaka's history, the committee studied many stone inscriptions preserved in the museums of Bangladesh and West Bengal. During their study, they reviewed the documents about stone inscriptions preserved in the Bangladesh National Museum and contacted the family members who had donated the inscriptions.In this process, they came to know that the stone inscription preserved in the museum was the actual stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra.According to Bangladesh National Museum records, Hakim Irtizar Rahman Khan, the eldest son of Hakim Habibur Rahman Khan donated the stone tablet with the inscription, to the museum on April 14, 1967. It was fragmented into 12 small pieces. Hakim Irtizar Rahman Khan died on July 30, 1980.""If the fragments of the stone tablet preserved in the museum can be arranged sequentially, then the inscription can be deciphered easily,"" Mawlana Muhammad Nuruddin Fatehpuri said while explaining why it took so long to find it.Renowned photographer Mahfuzur Rahman Khan, in a 2015 interview, told the committee that his grandfather Hakim Habibur Rahman Khan collected that stone inscription and his father, Hakim Irtizar got the inscription from his father. However, they could not give any information about how Hakim Habibur Rahman Khan obtained the stone inscription.The inscription, written in Persian, read, ""Sultan Shah Shuja dedicated himself to different types of charitable activities. Abul Qashim Al Hussaini Attabatayi Assimani endowed this holy place and 22 of its adjacent shops as Waqf. And, according to Islamic laws, he stated a specific condition-that the trustee of the property will spend all the earnings from the property and the adjacent shops for the maintenance of the building and for the welfare of the poor. If an impoverished person arrives here, the person shall be offered free accommodation and shall not be charged for any services so that the trustee will get the rewards on the Day of Judgement. If anyone violates this condition, the person will be held accountable on the Day of Judgement. The engraver of the inscription is Sa'duddin and the inscription was engraved in 1055 Mohammedan Year."" (Translated from Persian to Bengali by Muhammad Nuruddin Fatehpuri)
Hakim Habibur Rahman authored a number of books on Dhaka. However, none of them carries any reference to the stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra.
According to researcher Hashem Sufi, Hakim Habibur Rahman collected stone inscriptions from various places in Dhaka and donated them to museums.
During the Mughal era, Bara Katra was used as the caravanserai for travellers and merchants. However, its occupants changed over time. Some of the subadars of the late Mughal era also resided in this palace. Nawabs of Dhaka also used it as their residence before the construction of Nimtali palace. At one point, the palace became a shelter for homeless people.
At present, the southwest part of the palace is being used as a madrasa and the southeast part of the palace is occupied by local goons. They have built numerous shops, factories and warehouses and destroyed much of the original structure of the palace.
Recently, one of the current occupants started to demolish one of the remaining parts of the palace. Fortunately, on September 11, Rakhi Roy, regional director of the department of archaeology, and his team stopped them. Later, Barrister Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation paid a visit to Bara Katra and Chhoto Katra. Director General of the directorate of archaeology Ratan Chandra Pandit and architectural historian Professor Dr Abu Sayeed M Ahmed also accompanied him.

""Bara Katra must be preserved under government custody. It can be given to the custody of the city corporation or the district administration or even to the directorate of archaeology. But it cannot be handed over to any individual,"" the DSCC mayor said during the visit.
He acknowledged that negligence of government agencies has allowed the palace to be damaged and promised to preserve it.
Professor Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique welcomed the mayor's visit and commitment.
""Bara Katra and Chhoto Katra are two of our greatest heritages and archaeological assets of Dhaka. We should not change their original structure in the name of renovation and modernisation. Renovation works should be done under the supervision of an expert committee so that the original structure of the building can be maintained,"" he said.
Ratan Chandra Pandit, director general of the directorate of archaeology explained the challenges of preserving the structure to The Daily Star.
""The directorate of archaeology is responsible for the maintenance of Bara Katra. However, it is not the current owner of the land of Bara Katra. Whenever our officials go to renovate the structure, they face strong resistance from the current occupants. The archaeology department took an initiative to acquire the land of Bara Katra in 2009, but it failed. We will take another initiative to acquire the land. We have the expertise and resources to preserve and maintain Bara Katra but we need cooperation from the City Corporation, district administration, waqf administration and local people,"" he added.

/rohingya-influx/news/myanmar-conflicts-hurting-bangladesh-3132071,Myanmar conflicts hurting Bangladesh,"Conflicts in Myanmar intensified after the military coup on February 1 last year, as pro-democracy activists, the armed wing of National Unity Government and three dozen ethnic armed groups began fighting the junta.The Arakan Army, which was maintaining a ceasefire since November 2020, engaged in conflicts with the military from the middle of this year.The conflict has escalated to the point that there have been instances of mortar shells landing on Bangladesh's side of the border.Given that Bangladesh has been negotiating for repatriation of around one million Rohingya refugees, the conflict has serious implications on Bangladesh and beyond, analysts say.They observed that the Myanmar military is losing the public trust it enjoyed for decades. The junta has also become weaker while fighting the combines of the NUG's armed wing Peoples' Defence Force and ethnic armed groups that have been fighting for autonomy.Now, armed groups have become stronger and are stepping up their battle for full autonomy.The Arakan Army has been able to control administration in much of Rakhine State and is now desperate to take full control of the state, which is strategically important due to its proximity to the Bay of Bengal, they observed.Shahab Enam Khan, professor of international relations at Jahangirnagar University, said the junta also could not deliver on the five-point ASEAN consensus, including ending violence and restoring democracy. Also, the economy is suffering, and that is affecting Rakhine, already a cash-starved region.Harvard University Fellow Anu Anwar, an expert on Myanmar and China, said the Myanmar military had for decades been able to maintain territorial integrity despite being in a civil war with various armed groups.""What is new is the addition of new rebel groups, intensification of fighting in Arakan, and the emergence of NUG's armed wing. Most importantly, [there is] a tacit consensus among major armed groups on a common enemy -- military junta. Therefore, certainly this time the challenge is much greater.""Free Rohingya Coalition Co-founder Nay San Lwin, who is based in Germany, said the Burmese youths are much more united now against the Myanmar junta -- a reality that reflects the unity among the wider public of Myanmar. He thinks in the long run, the military will not last.Prof Shahab Anam said Myanmar is moving towards massive chaos as the military is failing to properly handle the situation. Eventually, chaos may lead to disintegration of Myanmar, he said.The intensified fighting will severely affect Myanmar's economy, which is already in a bad shape after the Covid-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions amid the Russia-Ukraine war. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the conflicts across Myanmar, while several thousands were killed.Prof Shahab said so far, mostly the Rohingyas have been the victims of conflicts in Rakhine State, but now Rakhine Buddhists are also becoming victims. Therefore, there is a real possibility of displacement of hundreds of thousands in Rakhine State.In that case, Bangladesh and Myanmar's other neighbours have reasons to worry.Anu Anwar said the intensified fighting certainly accelerated the possibility of disintegration.He said geo-strategically, Myanmar connects South and Southeast Asia with the Bay of Bengal. For economic, connectivity, and geopolitical reasons, regional powers such as Japan or India and superpowers like the US, China and Russia take a greater interest in Myanmar affairs.""A conflict in Myanmar will have multidimensional effects on the regional geopolitics…""Bangladesh, in particular, will be the primary victim of any conflict in and around Myanmar. A turmoil in Myanmar will not only increase the chances of a fresh influx of Rohingyas but also create the real possibility of an active conflict between two armed forces along the Naf River.""Anwar said there has never been any real hope of repatriation regardless of the regime in Naypyitaw. Not a single leader in Myanmar has ever taken meaningful initiative towards reparation.The only time Myanmar has taken the Rohingya issue seriously was in 1978, when the government of Bangladesh made a credible threat that unless Myanmar took back their people, Bangladesh would arm Rohingyas, and if necessary, Bangladesh's military would launch a pre-emptive strike against Burma. Since then, Bangladesh has pursued only diplomatic means, but that has produced no substantial results as the number of Rohingya refugees only increased, he said.""A fresh crackdown in Rakhine will not only tarnish the dying hope of repatriation but will generate a real possibility of a further influx of millions of Rohingyas into Bangladesh.""Shahab Enam Khan and Naw San Lwin said Rohingyas will not be willing to return to Myanmar when conflicts are escalating there.The experts said Myanmar's violation of territorial sovereignty and Rohingya repatriation are separate issues and should be dealt with separately.Anu Anwar said defending the land, air, and maritime boundary of a country is the duty of the armed forces.Shahab said Bangladesh should have deployed troops for deterrence and strongly raised Myanmar's violation of sovereignty with the UN.""Bangladesh needs to build a coalition of countries that support Bangladesh to mount pressure on Myanmar and work for Rohingya repatriation,"" he said, adding that bilateral negotiation is not working anymore.Nay San Lwin thought the same.Shahab Enam said Myanmar faced various sanctions because of the genocide against Rohingyas and military coup, mainly from western countries. Now, despite good relations, world powers like China and Russia, and even Japan, India and ASEAN are feeling uneasy about Myanmar.But it is likely that Myanmar's resources will still continue to attract them more than those of Bangladesh, he said.Anu Anwar said Beijing and Moscow provided cushion for the junta, which is nothing new. However, the new aspect is that world support for Bangladesh has increased in a dramatic fashion over the last few years.""Myanmar's isolation is a win for Bangladesh if Dhaka is able to seize the opportunity,"" he said."
/weekend-read/news/the-colourful-history-bara-katra-3132216,The colourful history of Bara Katra ,"""Katra"" is a Persian word that means caravanserai or roadside inn. Multiple katras were constructed during Mughal and Nawabi eras in Dhaka. Of them, Bara Katra and Chhoto Katra are mentionable.According to historians, Bara Katra was constructed in 1643-1644 CE/ 1053 AH by Abul Qashim who was ordered by the then subadar (Mughal provincial governor) prince Shah Shuja. Shuja constructed it for his official residence. However, the Mughal prince did not like the palace and donated it to Abul Qashim who converted it into a caravanserai. The palace was endowed for charitable purposes in 1645-46 CE/ 1055 AH.Bara Katra was located in between the Buriganga River and Chawk Bazaar. The river used to flow along the southern side of the palace even three centuries after its construction. The flow of the river was diverted due to the construction of an embankment to protect Dhaka from annual flooding. Later, human settlements mushroomed along the embankment and all around the palace. At present, the Bara Katra is located at Bara Katra Lane in Ward number 30 of Dhaka South City Corporation.Bara Katra is an ideal depiction of the Mughal architectural style. The two-stoey building was erected around an open rectangular courtyard. The palace overlooks the Buriganga River. There were two gates on the southern and northern corners of the palace and two small gateways on the western and eastern sides. "
/youth/education/news/teachers-public-univs-worktime-set-40-hours-week-3132066,Teachers at public univs: Worktime set at  40 hours a week,"A public university teacher will have to work 40 hours a week. Of this period, 13 hours must be spent on providing direct lessons to students on average.This has been stipulated by a policy, drawn up by the University Grants Commission in order to fix the teaching workload of all faculty members of the public universities.The policy titled ""Teaching load calculation policy for public university teachers"" has been prepared to keep teachers on the campus for a longer period and determine how many teachers are needed for a particular university for proper education and research.Under the policy, a professor's direct teaching hour will be 10 hours, an associate professor's 12 hours, an assistant professor's 14 hours and a lecturer's 16 hours, said UGC officials.Besides lecturing at classes, each teacher will have to conduct student counseling for one hour per week.UGC officials said once the policy comes into force next week, teachers' stay on the campus and their engagement with students will increase significantly.The policy will be sent to all public universities by next week.According to officials, there are allegations that many public university teachers do not spend enough time on the campus, and teach at private universities instead. Many even take classes at five-six private universities. Some of them spend time on consultancy jobs.""We hope that public university teachers will stay at the campus for a longer time following the implementation of the policy,"" said Ferdous Zaman, secretary of UGC.He said that a UGC meeting on Tuesday finalised the policy.Commission officials also said that sufficientnumber of teachers is essential for ensuing proper educational and research activities at public universities. The policy has been devised to ensure this. It will also be helpful in determining the number of teachers needed for any particular university.""Following the implementation of the policy, it will be easier to determine how many teachers will be required for the higher education institutions. In addition, this policy will play an important role in preparing organograms of different departments of universities. Renowned academicians have cooperated with the UGC in formulating this policy,"" said Prof Dil Afroza Begum, acting chairman of UGC.There are 15,500 teachers at 53 public universities. About 3.50 lakh students study at 50 of those universities.In the policy, a teacher's weekly 40 work hours has been divided into two parts -- Contact Hours and Non-Contact Hours. The 40 hours included five hours for prayers and lunch break.Under the Contact Hours, a teacher will have to deliver lectures at the classroom, give lessons at practical classes, hold tutorial classes, and supervise projects, internships or thesesof students for 13 hours per week.A teacher's Non-contact Hourswould cover preparation of course materials, conducting research, writing articles and books, preparing questions, evaluating exam answer scripts and attending academic and administrative meetings.The policy says that the Contact Hoursfor the head of a department and institution will be six hours.Universities will be able to apply to the UGC for having 20 percent additional teachers for a particular department or institute, if there is a possibility of disruption in educational activities due to study leave of a large number of teachers, it adds.Universities will file such applications based on teaching load calculation of a particular department or institution.According to the policy, if the number of teachers working in a particular department is found bigger after calculation of teaching load, the additional number of teachers will continue in their jobs till retirement.UGC Secretary Ferdous said there were serious problems regarding determining how many teachers were needed due to absence of a policy.""We have seen that 10 teachers were recruited against the requirement of five. In other cases, five teachers were appointed against the required 10,"" he said.UGC officials said a policy of workload of teachers at Indian universityis in place. A full-time teacher's working hours should not be less than 40 hours a week for 30 working weeks in an academic year, and the teacher must be available for at least five hours daily in the university/college.Under the policy, professors and associate professors need to give 14 hours of direct teaching per week, whereas for assistant professors the requirement is 16 hours.Prof Nizamul Hoque Bhuiyan, general secretary of the Federation of Bangladesh University Teachers Association, said they would be able to comment on whether the policy was bad or good only after it came into force.""We have to improve the quality of education and the international rankings of the universities. To achieve these goals, we will need to conduct innovative researches and introduce research-oriented education…if we can use the working hours positively, it will be good for us,"" said Nizamul, also the general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers Association."

/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/russia-annexes-four-regions-ukraine-3132076,Russia annexes four regions  of Ukraine,"""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever. We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means."" Russian President Vladimir Putin 
A defiant Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russia's annexation of a swathe of Ukraine in a pomp-filled Kremlin ceremony yesterday, promising Moscow would triumph in its ""special military operation"" against Kyiv even as some of his troops faced potential defeat. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Putin's proclamation of Russian rule over about 15 percent of Ukraine -- the biggest annexation in Europe since the second world war -- has been firmly rejected by Western countries and even many of Russia's close allies.
 








The declaration has been condemned by the West and prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to request fast-track Nato membership.



In one of the toughest anti-American speeches the Russian president has delivered in more than two decades in power, he signalled he was ready to continue a battle for a ""greater historical Russia"" using whatever tools he had at his disposal and slammed the West as neo-colonial and Satanist.
 







(L-R) The Moscow-appointed heads of the Kherson region Vladimir Saldo and Zaporizhzhia region Yevgeny Balitsky, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Donetsk separatist leader Denis Pushilin and Lugansk separatist leader Leonid Pasechnik join hands after signing treaties formally annexing four regions of Ukraine, at the Kremlin in Moscow, yesterday. Photo: AFP
Putin said the US had set a precedent when it had dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945, but stopped short of issuing new nuclear warnings against Ukraine himself, something he has done more than once in recent weeks.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had not yet seen Russia take any action that suggested it is contemplating the use of nuclear weapons, despite what he called Putin's ""loose talk.""



""Truth is on our side. Russia is with us!"" Putin told his country's political elite, who had gathered in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls to watch him sign documents annexing four Ukrainian regions.
The ceremony culminated in the 69-year-old leader chanting ""Russia Russia!"" as he clasped the hands of the four Russian-backed officials he wants to run the annexed regions, which Ukraine is fighting to win back.
""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever,"" said Putin, referring to the four Ukrainian regions which he said Russia was annexing.
""We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means,"" he said, calling on ""the Kyiv regime to immediately cease hostilities and return to the negotiation table"".
Zelensky, speaking in Kyiv, said he was ready for peace talks if and when Russia got a new president and announced that Ukraine was formally applying for fast-track membership of the Nato military alliance, something Moscow fiercely opposes.
Kyiv's move to join Nato was the pretext that Putin used for the offensive he launched on February 24.
""We have already proven our compatibility with (Nato) alliance standards,"" Zelensky said in a video posted by the Ukrainian presidency on social media.
""We are taking a decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to Nato,"" he added.
Zelensky and the West have condemned referendums that Moscow held in the four Ukrainian regions as illegal shams, while several dozen Ukrainians interviewed by Reuters in the last week said that only people they described as ""Russian collaborators"" had voted, with most people boycotting them.
US President Joe Biden condemned Russia's ""fraudulent"" declaration, vowing to keep backing Kyiv army.
""We will continue to support Ukraine's efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically,"" he said.
Washington yesterday announced new ""severe"" sanctions against Russian officials and the country's defence industry.
The latest sanctions come on top of sweeping measures already imposed by the US and allies this year that have already crippled Russia's international trading and local economy. But they stop short of Russia's energy industry, the country's largest source of hard currency.
Guidance from the US Treasury and Commerce departments warned that anyone outside Russia, including companies, that provide political, economic or material support to Moscow faced a heightened risk of sanctions.
The Treasury sanctions generally freeze any US assets of those designated and bar Americans from dealing with them.
Commerce added 57 entities in Russia and Crimea to bar exports.
Treasury said it imposed sanctions on 14 people in Russia's military-industrial complex, two leaders of the central bank, family members of top officials and 278 members of the legislature ""for enabling Russia's sham referenda and attempt to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory.""
Canada yesterday announced measures against dozens of oligarchs, financial elites and their family members, and 35 Russian-backed senior officials in the regions where the referendums took place.
Britain also put sanctions on the governor of the Russian central bank and imposed bans on new services and goods export.
Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said recent actions by Russia constitute the most serious escalation of the conflict since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February.
""This land grab is illegal and illegitimate. Nato allies do not and will not recognize any of this territory as part of Russia,"" Stoltenberg said.
""Putin has mobilised hundreds of thousands of more troops, engaged in irresponsible nuclear sabre-rattling and now illegally annexed more Ukrainian territory. Together, this represents the most serious escalation since the start of the war,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference.
However, he said the decision on Ukraine's Nato membership requires ""consensus"" of allies.
G7 and EU also said they would ""never recognise"" Russia's annexation of four more regions in Ukraine and pledged further sanctions against Moscow.
Despite warnings from Putin prior to the annexation that he could use nuclear weapons to defend the captured territories, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would ""continue liberating our land and our people"".
In central Moscow, at least 10,000 people convened for state-organised annexation celebrations, with huge banners emblazoned: ""Donetsk. Lugansk. Zaporizhzhia. Kherson. Russia!""
A concert in Red Square was replete with military and pomp and patriotic songs and throngs of Russians waving the national flag.
The four territories create a crucial land corridor between Russia and the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014.
The Kremlin said it ""needed to clarify"" the exact borders of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- neither fully controlled by Moscow's forces -- that it intends to annex.
Together, all five regions including Crimea, make up around 20 percent of Ukraine, whose forces in recent weeks have been clawing back wins as part of a counter-offensive.
The UN Security Council was scheduled to vote later yesterday on a resolution condemning the referendums, according to France, the council's current president, but it has no chance of passing due to Moscow's veto power.
""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever. We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means."" A defiant Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russia's annexation of a swathe of Ukraine in a pomp-filled Kremlin ceremony yesterday, promising Moscow would triumph in its ""special military operation"" against Kyiv even as some of his troops faced potential defeat.Putin's proclamation of Russian rule over about 15 percent of Ukraine -- the biggest annexation in Europe since the second world war -- has been firmly rejected by Western countries and even many of Russia's close allies.The declaration has been condemned by the West and prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to request fast-track Nato membership.In one of the toughest anti-American speeches the Russian president has delivered in more than two decades in power, he signalled he was ready to continue a battle for a ""greater historical Russia"" using whatever tools he had at his disposal and slammed the West as neo-colonial and Satanist.Putin said the US had set a precedent when it had dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945, but stopped short of issuing new nuclear warnings against Ukraine himself, something he has done more than once in recent weeks.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had not yet seen Russia take any action that suggested it is contemplating the use of nuclear weapons, despite what he called Putin's ""loose talk.""""Truth is on our side. Russia is with us!"" Putin told his country's political elite, who had gathered in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls to watch him sign documents annexing four Ukrainian regions.The ceremony culminated in the 69-year-old leader chanting ""Russia Russia!"" as he clasped the hands of the four Russian-backed officials he wants to run the annexed regions, which Ukraine is fighting to win back.""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever,"" said Putin, referring to the four Ukrainian regions which he said Russia was annexing.""We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means,"" he said, calling on ""the Kyiv regime to immediately cease hostilities and return to the negotiation table"".Zelensky, speaking in Kyiv, said he was ready for peace talks if and when Russia got a new president and announced that Ukraine was formally applying for fast-track membership of the Nato military alliance, something Moscow fiercely opposes.Kyiv's move to join Nato was the pretext that Putin used for the offensive he launched on February 24.""We have already proven our compatibility with (Nato) alliance standards,"" Zelensky said in a video posted by the Ukrainian presidency on social media.""We are taking a decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to Nato,"" he added.Zelensky and the West have condemned referendums that Moscow held in the four Ukrainian regions as illegal shams, while several dozen Ukrainians interviewed by Reuters in the last week said that only people they described as ""Russian collaborators"" had voted, with most people boycotting them.US President Joe Biden condemned Russia's ""fraudulent"" declaration, vowing to keep backing Kyiv army.""We will continue to support Ukraine's efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically,"" he said.Washington yesterday announced new ""severe"" sanctions against Russian officials and the country's defence industry.The latest sanctions come on top of sweeping measures already imposed by the US and allies this year that have already crippled Russia's international trading and local economy. But they stop short of Russia's energy industry, the country's largest source of hard currency.Guidance from the US Treasury and Commerce departments warned that anyone outside Russia, including companies, that provide political, economic or material support to Moscow faced a heightened risk of sanctions.The Treasury sanctions generally freeze any US assets of those designated and bar Americans from dealing with them.Commerce added 57 entities in Russia and Crimea to bar exports.Treasury said it imposed sanctions on 14 people in Russia's military-industrial complex, two leaders of the central bank, family members of top officials and 278 members of the legislature ""for enabling Russia's sham referenda and attempt to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory.""Canada yesterday announced measures against dozens of oligarchs, financial elites and their family members, and 35 Russian-backed senior officials in the regions where the referendums took place.Britain also put sanctions on the governor of the Russian central bank and imposed bans on new services and goods export.Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said recent actions by Russia constitute the most serious escalation of the conflict since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February.""This land grab is illegal and illegitimate. Nato allies do not and will not recognize any of this territory as part of Russia,"" Stoltenberg said.""Putin has mobilised hundreds of thousands of more troops, engaged in irresponsible nuclear sabre-rattling and now illegally annexed more Ukrainian territory.

/news/bangladesh/news/the-fight-save-their-field-3132146,The fight to save their field,"For decades, the residents of Mirpur-11 have made themselves well-acquainted with the only open space they have, the one located on Paris Road. Many grew up playing there every day after school, and many made lifelong friends and memories after spending hours on end in the field.Fourteen places had been earmarked as playgrounds, parks or fields in Mirpur. But they were turned into plots in 1994, as per the decision of then housing minister, violating the master plan and depriving local residents.This place was one of them.""This field on Paris Road was also turned into plots at that time. But we've been trying to protect the place since then,"" said Kazi Jahirul Islam Manik, ward-3 councillor of Dhaka North City Corporation.Manik said the three lakh residents of ward-3 do not have any field or park aside from this open space.And so, for a long time locals have been waging a fight, demanding the government protect their lone field, he added. Recently, after the new DAP was gazetted last month, their protest got momentum as the place has been designated as an open space there.Locals also organised a human chain and hunger strike to save the place, which was allotted to a section of people, violating the master plan of Dhaka Improvement Trust 1963.Currently the space remains abandoned, with piled up garbage  dumped there.""This land was earmarked as an open space in the 1963 master plan. It's also an open space in the new Detailed Area Plan,"" said Manik.Manik initiated a hunger strike on Thursday. A large number of people, including students, teachers, and guardians of 37 schools; former national football players; local clubs; and imams took part.The residents want the field to be handed over to the city corporation, no matter who the owner is. They wish for this place to turn into a proper field, he said.Sustainable Development Goals states that for every 12,500 people, a separate playground and park is a must. Going off that information, 24 such spaces are required for the ward. And yet, this is the lone playing field, Manik explained.In 2017, the prime minister issued a directive saying that this place will remain a playing field, he mentioned.The 1994 allotment is unethical and should be cancelled, Manik demanded.Ashrafun Nesa Parul, senior teacher of Jannat Academy High School, was brought up in the area. She said this field is crucial for the children's physical and mental development.""We want our children to lead a healthy life; every family here wants that,"" she added.Mohammad Anowar Hossain Ripon, principal of Mirpur Science College, said his institution has no playground or field, and locals have almost no place to play. So, the lone field is the only bastion for the youngsters. Elderly people also benefit, as they have a place for regular physical activities.Showing solidarity with the movement, DNCC Mayor Md Atiqul Islam requested the prime minister to allot the space as a playing field.The mayor, who visited the area on Thursday, said the area has over three lakh residents and around 60 educational institutes. But there is no field for them.The field is designated as an open space in the new DAP, but National Housing Authority has allotted it as plots. This is absolutely unacceptable, he said. ""We will protect this field with the support of locals.""Thirty percent of Dhaka city wards do not have any playground or park. This situation hinders the mental and physical growth of children, as they have no space to play and interact with friends, say experts.According to the DAP, 25 out of 75 wards under Dhaka South City Corporation and 10 out of 55 wards under DNCC do not have a single park or playground.About 20 million people live in the capital, and considering the population density, there should be over a dozen parks and play areas in each ward, said Adil Mohammad Khan, former general secretary of Bangladesh Institute of Planners.""But there's a dearth of open spaces, and the available places get too crowded. Ultimately, many children are discouraged to go to the few parks or playgrounds we have,"" he explained."

/sports/cricket/news/our-target-retain-the-trophy-3132196,‘Our target is to retain the trophy’,"The eighth edition of the Women's Asia Cup begins today with defending champions and hosts Bangladesh taking on Thailand at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium in Sylhet.The game is slated to begin at 9:00am before the opening day's second fixture sees India take on Sri Lanka from 1:30pm at the same venue.Fresh off an imperious campaign in the 2023 World Cup Qualifiers in the UAE, the Tigresses will aim to defend the trophy they won by beating India in a close contest in Kuala Lumpur in 2018. Captain Nigar Sultana Joty said they were not taking any added pressure as hosts, but would like to make the most of playing at their 'home venue'.""It's not a challenge [playing at home] to be playing at home. Our target is to go match by match. We are not going to nit-pick the opposition's strengths and weaknesses. If we can execute our plans, we don't have to worry about challenges,"" she said.Teams such as India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan will once again prove to be the main obstacles to Tigresses defending the trophy, but the skipper believes her team has improved as well.""Every team has improved and so have we. We just want to maintain and go forward with our plans.The women's [cricket team's] home venue is Sylhet, so of course we want to take advantage of that. Since the trophy belongs to us, we will try to defend it. The target is to retain the trophy,"" she said.Medium pacer Jahanara Alam is set to feature in the tournament, having missed the World Cup qualifiers due to a hand injury, and Joty believed the pacer's experience would come in handy.The weather at Sylhet has been pretty hot as teams gear up for the tournament, but Joty was not too concerned.""We are not thinking of the weather. Since we played in Abu Dhabi, the temperature being high there provided us with good preparation. The good news is that no one faced pulled any muscles in that weather or had any other concerns which is a sign that everyone is fit,"" she concluded."
/news/bangladesh/news/dhakas-canine-conundrum-3132141,Dhaka’s canine conundrum,"Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation have taken no visibly effective measures to control the urban dog population, and this has led to city residents treating neighbourhood dogs in a cruel, violent and inhumane manner.The High Court banned dog culling in 2020 on grounds of animal rights. Meanwhile, experts and animal-rights activists believe sterilisation is the appropriate measure to control the dog population.However, due to the lack of human resources, budget and planning, neither DNCC nor DSCC are unable to discharge their duties in this regard.According to Dhaka Infectious Disease Hospital, 45,477 people were treated for dog bite-related injuries in 2020, while the number rose to 52,012 in 2021.So far, around 38,000 people have received treatment from the hospital with similar injuries this year.Compared to these numbers, vaccination drives have proven to be insufficient.Communicable Disease Control (CDC) of DGHS stated that 42,935 dogs were vaccinated in areas under the two city corporations in 2019. As part of rabies eradication measures, 49,580 dogs were vaccinated in 2020.However, the drives stopped after one year and nine months.""There has been no activity for a year. Councillors have no opportunity to take any action in this regard. People in my area have killed three dogs in the last two weeks,'' said Saidul Islam, councillor of ward-57 under DSCC.Rubaiya Ahmed, chairperson of Obhoyaronno, said DNCC has provided some support to their operations, while DSCC has remained inactive since 2014.In 2020, after a petition was filed to stop transferring dogs from their territories, DSCC promised to implement a neutering and vaccination programme for neighbourhood dogs, Rubaiya said.""However, they continue to cull and relocate dogs at any given chance. They do not have any sustainable plan in this regard,"" she added.Rakibul Haq Emil, founder and chairperson of People for Animal Welfare (PAW) Foundation, said sterilisation operations are crucial from the July-to-September period, the peak season for dog breeding.""However, no such activities have been in place. People continue to grow more hostile to their neighbourhood dogs,"" said Emil.""Our organisation receives four to five reports of dog culling every month. The two city corporations cannot avoid their responsibility in this regard,"" he added.DNCC Public Health Officer Lutfar Rahman said there is no workforce or logistical support for controlling the dog population.""In the current economic situation, there is not enough budget for this work. Efforts are being made with limited workforce. A lack of awareness leads to people killing dogs,'' he said.DSCC Chief Health Officer Dr Fazle Shamsul Karim echoed the same. He said five veterinary doctors have joined DSCC's health department recently.Dr M Mujibur Rahaman, DGHS expert of mass dog vaccination programme, said due to excessive pollution in Dhaka city, lack of adequate waste management, and overcrowding, most dogs have some sort of sickness.""Bites and other untoward incidents are reduced when dogs are healthy and in controlled numbers,"" he said.""Coordination between the two city corporation authorities is required to conduct neutering programmes,"" he added.DNCC has been running such programmes for 10 years despite the lack of human resources. However, DSCC has not shown much zeal, he added.  "

This land grab is illegal and illegitimate.""NATO allies do not and will not recognise any of this territory as part of Russia,"" he added. ""We call on all states to reject Russia's blatant attempts at territorial conquest These lands are Ukraine.""He said NATO was not a party to the conflict, but it reaffirmed its ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and would continue to support the country in defending itself against Russia."
/sports/cricket/news/historic-female-inclusive-asia-cup-commences-today-3132046,Historic female-inclusive Asia Cup commences today,"The much-awaited Women's Asia Cup, played in the 20-over format since 2012, returns with its eighth edition in Sylhet as the curtain-raiser sees defending champions Bangladesh take on Thailand at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium Ground 2 (SICS Outer) today from Bangladesh Standard Time 9:00 am.The coronavirus pandemic had postponed the biennial event by a couple of years after the previous edition was played in 2018, where Bangladesh broke the complete monopoly India had over the regional competition. The final was a game to remember for everyone, a game which saw the Tigresses bag a three-wicket win with a last-ball thriller to seal their maiden Asia Cup triumph against the six-time winners. A competition that featured only two teams – India and Sri Lanka – in its augural edition in 2004 before Pakistan and Bangladesh began participating from the second and fourth edition onwards, respectively, this Asia Cup features as many as seven teams -- including hosts Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, and the UAE – aim to fight for the Asian supremacy over the span of two weeks.Bangladesh team led by Nigar Sultana Joty are well-balanced with a fine blend of youth and experience. ""As hosts, we will give 110 per cent to defend our title,"" said Joty after returning home from the UAE.


Bangladesh team led by Nigar Sultana Joty are well-balanced with a fine blend of youth and experience. ""As hosts, we will give 110 per cent to defend our title,"" said Joty after returning home from the UAE.""For the first time in history, 7 women's teams will be participating in a complete round robin format. The ACC is constantly striving toward being more inclusive,"" stated Jay Shah, president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).Record participants aside, as maiden hosts, Bangladesh would be part of a historic chapter as all of the two on-field umpires and the match referee are set to feature female figures, composed of the Sri Lankan trio of Dedunu De Silva, Nimali Perera, and Vanessa De Silva.  ""The 2022 edition of the Women's Asia Cup will therefore see more embedded female participation. For the first time ever, an ACC tournament will see an all-female presence on the playing field, with the women's tournament slated to have only female umpires and female match referees. As an organisation, we hope to continue to take steps to strengthen the sport by highlighting female talent in every avenue,"" further stated the ACC president.This Asia cup has a lot at stake, as ever, especially considering the top teams taking the tournament as a launching pad to get into the groove ahead of the upcoming T20 World Cup in 2023. Bangladesh have come a long way since debuting in the T20 international circuit in 2012 and would want to see their growth curve going upward following a string of impressive performances this year in the format.Even though the Tigresses missed out on a spot at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games as the result in the decider in January went into Sri Lanka's favour, but following that event, Bangladesh, however unsurprisingly, had sealed their spot in the upcoming T20 World Cup by becoming the unbeaten champions in the recently concluded Qualifiers, held in the UAE. Bangladesh team led by Nigar Sultana Joty are well-balanced with a fine blend of youth and experience. ""As hosts, we will give 110 per cent to defend our title,"" said Joty after returning home from the UAE.As far as tournament favourites are concerned, India remain the team to beat. The latest Commonwealth Games finalists are enjoying a good run of form and despite Jhulan Goswami calling it quits recently, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side appear well balanced without their star performer. Meanwhile, Pakistan are undergoing a rebuilding phase. Their Commonwealth Games journey in July was a disappointment as Pakistan lost all three of the games to remain as bottom dwellers in their group. How captain Bismah Maroof marshals her troops without the injured star pacer Fatima Sana will be a tough ask too, and Pakistan's first big obstacle will be in their second game against Bangladesh on October 03. Sri Lanka, too, would be eager to see their women go the distance after the men's cricket team sealed the bragging rights earlier in the Asia Cup, held last month. Among the seven teams, the UAE and Malaysia – who booked their Asia Cup berths on the virtue of reaching the final of the 10-team ACC Women's T20 Championship earlier in June – would want to display competitive cricket alongside Thailand. As far as the tournament format is concerned, it involves each side playing the other once in a round-robin format. Afterward, the top four sides progress to the semi-finals before the grand finale on October 15.With women's sports in Bangladesh gaining traction after the sustained and recent success of the country's cricket and football teams alike, the historic all-female on-field Asia Cup could provide a massive boost to the fast-evolving sector as the defending champions could draw crowds in numbers to Sylhet from all parts of Bangladesh.Experts may deem India as favourites on paper, but given the tournament features the shortest format, the games are prone to be more competitive. And that is why, when The Daily Star asked Bangladesh captain about her expectations in the Asia Cup and about the difference in quality between Bangladesh and other teams, Joty had replied: ""In T20 cricket, the difference in levels are very close. Whichever team makes fewer mistakes on a particular day has a higher chance to win the game."""
/opinion/views/news/were-working-very-hard-increase-bangladeshs-export-china-3132011,‘We’re working very hard to increase Bangladesh’s export to China’,"Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming shares his views on the depth and prospects of the bilateral relationship between Bangladesh and China in an exclusive interview with Porimol Palma of The Daily Star, on the occasion of China's 73rd founding anniversary on today.What are the achievements from the Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's recent visit to Bangladesh?China and Bangladesh are amicable neighbours and strategic partners of cooperation. Through the visit, China and Bangladesh renewed commitment to their traditional friendship, reiterated the One China principle, agreed to deepen strategic integration, and further enhanced practical cooperation, thereby jointly committing to maintain stability in the region and beyond amid an uneasy international environment.Bangladesh is going through economic challenges in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. How can China help Bangladesh in mitigating this immediate challenge?To meet the present challenges, I think Bangladesh can do the following together with China: first, join the Global Development Initiative (GDI) proposed by China; second, fully utilise and benefit from the zero-tariff treatment to 98 percent of Bangladeshi products exported to China; third, advance studies on Bangladesh-China FTA and enhance common development of Bangladesh-China economy; fourth, accelerate the promotion of the MoU on special assistance plan for disaster prevention and mitigation; and fifth, promote the work related to taka-renminbi currency swap and enhance Bangladesh's foreign exchange payment capacity.China has two new initiatives: Global Development Initiative (GDI) and Global Security Initiative (GSI). What implications do they have for Bangladesh?President Xi Jinping has put forward these initiatives in response to the urgent needs of developing countries as well as global development and world peace, following the guideline of policy coordination and practical cooperation, so as to help the developing countries maintain national stability, promote economic recovery, and advance the 2030 Agenda. I think these areas are also core concerns for Bangladesh; these solutions will surely assist Bangladesh in solving the present challenges and development difficulties if they can be effectively implemented. China is ready to work with Bangladesh to advance the implementation of GDI and GSI, step up coordination in international and regional affairs, safeguard the common interests of our two countries and other developing countries, jointly promote regional development and prosperity, and build a community with a shared future.China is willing to strengthen the alignment of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Bangladesh's Vision 2041. How will it be done?Bangladesh's Vision 2041 plan provides a roadmap for accelerating growth and lays down broad approaches for eradication of poverty, inequality and human deprivation. By implementing the plan, Bangladesh is expected to make rapid changes in agriculture, trade and industry, education, healthcare, transportation and communication, etc.The BRI is the right avenue for tangible and intangible outcomes pertinent to innovative, harmonised, green, open, high-quality and shared development, which protects and maintains peace and promotes people's well-being in the post-Covid-19 era. BRI is proposed by China, but not owned exclusively by China. Ever since its genesis, BRI has been aimed at integration into the development strategies of all parties interested. Bangladesh is one of the first countries to respond to the BRI and has become one of the countries with the most cooperation and fruitful results under the BRI framework.As strategic partners of cooperation, it is natural for Bangladesh and China to coordinate in terms of development strategies. We have established the Joint Economic and Trade Committee as an institutional arrangement for Bangladesh-China economic and trade cooperation. According to data from China, the bilateral trade between the countries increased significantly in 2021, exceeding USD 25 billion. The turnover of China's contracted projects to Bangladesh remained at the forefront of South Asian countries, and China's investment in Bangladesh increased by more than 290 percent year-on-year.To further enhance integration of development strategy, the two sides could work together in several areas. First, we need to further strengthen political mutual trust, consolidate the foundation for win-win results, enhance risk management and control, and secure the cooperation environment against a rapidly changing international situation. Second, we need to further enhance intergovernmental cooperation and promote implementation of major projects. Third, we need to fully utilise the high-quality projects and expand the volume of cooperation, such as Bangabandhu Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center, the zero-tariff treatment for 98 percent of Bangladeshi products exported to China, and the large-scale international exhibitions like the China International Import Exposition and the Canton Fair. Fourth, we need to explore new opportunities and cultivate new growth points. Specifically, we can promote PPP cooperation, advance studies on bilateral FTA, jointly respond to the pandemic and climate change, restore rivers, develop green and low-carbon energies, and work together on a digital economy.Bangladesh's export to China is less than USD 1 billion a year, though the bilateral trade is USD 25 billion. Why is the trade gap so wide?About one-third of Bangladesh's imports from China are textile fabrics, cotton yarn and thread, man-made filaments and staple fibres, which are all important raw materials for Bangladesh's RMG industry. Apart from the textile raw materials, another 27 percent of Bangladesh's imports from China are machinery and mechanical appliances, electrical machinery and equipment and parts, sound recorders and reproducers, which are important equipment for Bangladesh's various manufacturing industries and infrastructural projects.To put it in another way, although there is a trade deficit, the imported textile raw materials and mechanical equipment (that comprise most of the amount) are all of great necessity and are helping Bangladesh's RMG exports, manufacturing industry and development. So, we need a right perspective to view this temporary imbalance of trade, and we're working very hard to increase Bangladesh's export to China, to reduce trade deficit and maintain trade balances. The duty-free treatment of 98 percent tariff lines is granted by the Chinese government, precisely to increase Bangladesh's exports to China.Since September 1, China is giving duty-free access to 98 percent of Bangladeshi products, which has been increased by one percent. What products would be included in the additional percentage, and can it make any significant increase in export to China?Several kinds of basic leather products have been added, which is good news for Bangladeshi exporters in the leather industry, an industry with huge potential. Businessmen in the leather industry have already been focusing on the opportunity provided by the 98 percent duty-free treatment. Programmes such as ""Bangladesh leather and leather products promotion webinar"" are undergoing and helping Chinese leather product manufacturing enterprises to form business relations with leather exporters in Bangladesh.Dhaka and Beijing signed an agreement for 27 projects with an estimated cost of USD 20 billion. As of now, only eight projects have been undertaken and USD 3.8 billion has been disbursed. Why is that and how can this be sped up?Well, this may not be accurate enough. Bangladesh and China have been actively cooperating and working together to promote the progress of the MoU projects. As far as I know, most of the major projects have been progressing smoothly, more than eight are completed, and a good number of the others are expected to be completed by the end of 2024.Here, we have to make it clear that the MoU on Strengthening Investment and Production Capacity Cooperation, signed during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Bangladesh in 2016, is not a commitment of a basket of Government Concessional Loan (GCL) or Preferential Buyers Credit (PBC). The 27 projects attached to the MoU are only a list of projects to be considered for promotion by both sides, not a list of GCL or PBC projects. It should be stressed that only projects that have been evaluated and approved by both sides and for which loan agreements have been signed are the GCL and PBC projects, for which the Chinese side would commit to provide GCL or PBC loan support.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi proposed signing an MoU on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Cooperation Framework. How can signing this MoU help? Is the PPP model more efficient?It will help the governments to better play the regulatory role, select better quality enterprises to participate in the economic cooperation between Bangladesh and China, constantly improve the quality and efficiency of cooperation, and better avoid risks. At the same time, it will help Chinese companies better and more widely participate in Bangladesh's construction in the fields of energy, urban development, ports, rail transit, roads and bridges, airports, and so on. We believe that signing a G2G MoU on PPP is an ideal way of enhancing bilateral cooperation and will serve the interests of both sides.High costs of projects and their commercial feasibility are an issue of concern. This is much talked about in the case of Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port. Do you have any new policy in mind regarding cost efficiency in Chinese projects and funding?All Chinese projects have been evaluated and approved by the Bangladesh government and the Chinese government before implementation. Economic feasibility and cost efficiency of the projects have been fully demonstrated by professional institutions on both sides and recognised by both governments. Bangladesh and China will continue to strengthen cooperation and work together in this area. If anyone can name any single Chinese-funded project that is commercially or financially unfeasible, please tell me.How do you want to cooperate on environmental protection and climate change actions as Bangladesh is at the forefront of the challenges?Climate change and green development constitute one of the eight areas of GDI. Under this framework, China will carry out more extensive cooperation with Bangladesh in the fields of renewable resources and clean energy. We will encourage and guide Chinese enterprises to adopt more advanced technologies and equipment to invest in more environmentally friendly projects in Bangladesh.A common perception is that China is not doing enough in addressing the Rohingya crisis, given that you have strong influence in Myanmar. How do you respond to the criticism?China has been a facilitator between the two countries, and has always held that the issue should be resolved peacefully through bilateral negotiation and consultation. We have been providing support to both Bangladesh and Myanmar, aiming to improve the ground-level condition and to create a favourable environment for commencing repatriation. Because of the political change in Myanmar early last year, negotiations on the Rohingya issue were once suspended between Bangladesh and Myanmar. However, the intent to solve the problem propelled the two neighbours back on track for discussion, leading to re-engagement at various levels, including the Fifth Joint Working Group meeting held in June this year. We call upon all like-minded countries to do the same. The international community should play a constructive role in the process of finding a durable solution to the Rohingya issue."
/sports/football/news/gabriel-jesus-says-he-left-city-over-guardiola-style-3132356,Gabriel Jesus says he left City over Guardiola style,"Arsenal's Brazil striker Gabriel Jesus left Manchester City because he no longer wanted to play under Pep Guardiola, he said in an interview published by ESPN Brasil on Friday.The 25-year-old has made a sensational start at the Emirates since he was unveiled as Arsenal's marquee $50 million (45 million pounds) summer signing by manager Mikel Arteta, a former assistant to Guardiola at the Etihad.Jesus has been one of the stars of the early season with four goals and three assists in his first seven Premier League matches for the Gunners.""I was very happy at Manchester City, it's not that I was unhappy there,"" said Jesus.""But I also had to accept the way the team wanted me to play ... The issue was the way that he (Guardiola) understood football and what he wanted.""In this case, it's up to you to accept it or not. If you don't accept it, then 'thanks' and let's go for another challenge.""I accepted it for a while but then I got to the point when I said: 'I want something else for me'. I thanked him ... he understood and that's it.""The former Palmeiras forward had been unhappy with the amount of playing time he was given by Guardiola and left City as the Citizens signed Norway star Erling Haaland and young Argentine prospect Julian Alvarez.Haaland has made a sensational start with 11 goals in seven league games.Jesus spent five years in Manchester, winning the Premier League four times, the FA Cup once, the League Cup three times, and playing in the 2021 Champions League final.But he was unhappy at being mostly deployed by Guardiola on the flank rather than his preferred center forward role.""Here at Arsenal, it's different, the football is different, there are different players, different ways of playing,"" he said.""At City it was different, the forward didn't touch the ball much, you just have to watch the games to see.""I spoke a lot with Arteta about the style of play. He knows me, I know him, I understood what he wanted from me.""Arteta was a first team coach at City when Jesus joined in 2017, and left for the North Londoners two years later.""Here I'm free on the pitch, playing football with a smile on my face and always trying to give my best,"" said Jesus.After six wins from their seven matches, Arsenal are top of the Premier League ahead of Saturday's North London derby against third-placed Tottenham.Despite his great club form, Jesus was not called up by Brazil coach Tite for September's World Cup warm-up friendlies, a 3-0 win over Ghana and 5-1 thrashing of Tunisia."
/sports/football/news/bayern-fans-show-support-azmoun-and-iran-protesters-3132366,Bayern fans show support for Azmoun and Iran protesters,"Bayern Munich fans on Friday waited for Iranian striker Sardar Azmoun to take the field for opponents Bayer Leverkusen to unveil banners supporting the protests taking place in Iran.The fans revealed the banners in the 60th minute, when Azmoun - who has spoken out in favour of the protests online - came off the bench.One banner read 'women, life, freedom' in Farsi - a common chant heard in the Iranian protests - while another, in English, read 'solidarity with the feminist revolution in Iran'.Earlier this week, Iranian football bloggers took screenshots of an Instagram post from Azmoun saying that because of ""restrictive rules on the Team Melli (Iran), I could not say anything"".But he added that he could not stay silent due to the crackdown against the protests.""This will never be erased from our consciousness. Shame on you!"" he wrote. The post was deleted and the entire content of the Instagram account, followed by some five million people, disappeared for days.The protests, which have swept across the country and resulted in several deaths, are in response to the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman in police custody.Amini was arrested for allegedly breaching Iran's strict rules on religious clothing."
/news/asia/india/news/russias-illegal-referenda-ukraine-india-abstains-unsc-vote-3132371,"India, China abstain, as Russia vetoes UN resolution on Ukraine annexation","India abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution that would have declared Russia's annexation of four Ukrainian territories as invalid.The resolution tabled by the US and Albania, which would have condemned Moscow's ""illegal referenda,"" failed to get adopted on Friday as permanent UNSC member Russia vetoed it, reports our New Delhi correspondent.It was supported by 10 of the 15 members of the Council, while China, Gabon and Brazil also abstained.India cited the ""totality of the evolving situation"" as the reason for its abstention from voting.While abstaining on the resolution, India called for an immediate cessation of violence in Ukraine and stressed the need for a return to the negotiating table.The draft resolution had declared that Russia's ""unlawful actions"" with regards to the ""illegal so-called referenda"" taken between September 23 and 27 this year in parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya which are under Russia's temporary control can have ""no validity"" and cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine, including any ""purported annexation"" of any of these regions by Moscow.India had on multiple occasions in the past abstained from voting against Russia on the Ukraine issue.The only time India had voted against Russia was on August 24 this year during a ""procedural vote"" at the Security Council on Ukraine when the Council invited Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to address a meeting through a video tele-conference."
/law-our-rights/rights-advocacy/news/right-the-taxpayers-protect-personal-data-3132286,Right of the taxpayers to protect personal data,"Data protection and privacy are recognised as fundamental rights. An individual's 'private life' includes the protection of his or her personal data. Personal data, in principle, is information that identifies an individual, or is related to the individual. Most of the countries in the world includes a right of privacy in their Constitutions. In many countries, international instruments that recognise privacy rights such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights have been adopted into domestic law.The Finance Act 2022-23 makes compulsory submission of income tax return and obtaining of acknowledgement receipt having information of income, assets and total tax paid etc. for obtaining registration of co-operative society; obtaining or renewal of license or enlistment as a surveyor of general insurance; obtaining registration, by a resident, of the deed of transfer, obtaining or maintaining a credit card; obtaining or continuing the connection of electricity in a city corporation or cantonment board. The acknowledgement receipt form issued by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) is the proof of income tax return submission before a certificate is ready, and it reveals the taxpayer's gross wealth, taxable income and tax paid, inadvertently disclosing such confidential information to third parties. Experts opined that this is a violation of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1984 and the draft Income Tax Law 2021. This compulsion of disclosure of private information is against many laws of the country.The Constitution of Bangladesh under article 43 grants every citizen the right, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interests of the security of the state, public order, public morality, or public health, to the privacy of his/her correspondence and other means of communication. The Constitution does not expressly grant the fundamental right to privacy. There are many laws and rules for security of personal data of the citizens, and the government has drafted a Data Protection Law and asked for opinion of different stakeholders. This was recognised by the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in the State v Oli (2019), where the court observed that 'every citizen was entitled to the right to privacy under the Constitution'.Sections 7(h),(i),(j)and (r) of the Right to Information Act provide that any information which may offend the privacy of one's life, any information which may endanger life or physical safety of any person, any information given secretly to assist the law enforcing agencies, or any personal information protected by any law, are not subject to mandatory disclosure by government and certain private organisations. That means anybody cannot get any information regarding privacy or personal data.On the other hand, the information collected by Government is a resource of the citizen and managed on their behalf by Government. There is no general right for people to see the information held by government departments. People should be able to obtain access to these resources and to participate in government policy development and decision making.Freedom of information and privacy Act or Rule aims to ensure that the information collected about people by government agencies is accurate and not misused. People do not have any obligation to disclose their financial situation to even their close ones, but the new finance Act is compelling taxpayers to disclose such sensitive information to unauthorised third parties.The Income Tax Ordinance 1984, under section 163(1) restricts that all particulars or information contained in the following shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed, namely:-(a) any statement made, return furnished or accounts or documents produced under the provisions of this Ordinance; (b) any evidence given, or affidavit or deposition made, in the course of any proceedings under this Ordinance other than proceedings under Chapter XXI; (c) any record of any assessment proceedings or any proceeding relating to the recovery of demand under this Ordinance. Although the tax payer may disclose and sections 163-6 shall not be construed as prohibiting the voluntary disclosure of any particulars referred to in sub-section (1) by the person by whom the statement was made, return furnished, accounts or documents produced, evidence given or affidavit or deposition made, as the case may be.The draft Income Tax Law in chapter 19 and section 297(1) gives priority itself over other laws of the country and declares all the information related to income, expenditure and asset disclosure as prohibited. Even the court is not as such allowed to instruct for presentation of these information under the Evidence Act, 1872. Under section 297(3)(a), the court may requestfor that informationin accordance with the Penal Code, 1860 and the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947.Moreover, the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has launched a digital system to verify the authenticity of tax-return submissions and expedite service delivery by the authorities concerned. Its income-tax wing officially opened the 'tax return verification module' on August 21, 2022. Anyone from across the country can verify the authenticity of the return submission by inserting Taxpayers Identification Number (TIN) in the module, available on the NBR's website. Any other authorities may come into an arrangement with NBR to verify the acknowledgement receipt without disclosing the private data and abide by the different laws ensuring the right to private data of the citizens.It appears that the Finance Act 2022-23 is contradictory to Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and other laws, and this is why, the Finance Act should be amended to protect the private information of the taxpayers. The writer is Non-Government Adviser, Bangladesh Competition Commission."
