Hundreds of miles of coastline, stretching from Georgia to North Carolina, were under a hurricane warning.Police in the Isle of Palms yesterday posted a video showing dark skies above rough white-cap waves near the shoreline as gusty winds blew across the beach-front community on a barrier island in South Carolina.The extent of damage in Florida, where Ian first came ashore on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US mainland, became more apparent on Thursday as emergency crews began reaching stranded residents. The death toll remains uncertain."

/weekend-read/news/discovery-may-save-bara-katra-3132221,A discovery that may save Bara Katra,"An exciting new discovery by researchers has raised the hope of saving one of the most important heritage sites of Dhaka – the Bara Katra, a Mughal-era palace built for a prince and later turned into an inn for travellers.The historic stone inscription discovered by Committee for Commissioning Books on Architecture (Dhakar Sthapotto Bishoyok Grontho Pronoyon Committee) is the only testament of ownership of Bara Katra, an ancient site that has been left in neglect and at the mercy of those occupying it.The organisation stumbled upon this precious artefact while researching ancient stone and copper inscriptions found in Dhaka. The stone inscription was found in Bangladesh National Museum and, after examining it, the researchers realised that it was the original stone inscription on the north gate of the palace.During the Mughal era, Bara Katra was used as the caravanserai for travellers and merchants. However, its occupants changed over time. Some of the subadars of the late Mughal era also resided in this palace. 


During the Mughal era, Bara Katra was used as the caravanserai for travellers and merchants. However, its occupants changed over time. Some of the subadars of the late Mughal era also resided in this palace. The inscription clearly declares Bara Katra and the 22 shops adjacent to the palace as 'waqf' property.Waqf property is an inalienable charitable endowment under Islamic law. Eminent architectural historian and president of Arch Asia, a representative body of Asian architects, Professor Dr Abu Sayeed M Ahmed said, ""According to the law, waqf property can never be owned by any individual. The stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra testifies that Bara Katra is in no way a private property.""However, the current occupants of Bara Katra are claiming that they are owners of this historic place.According to the Committee's research, renowned author, researcher and chronicler Hakim Habibur Rahman obtained the historic stone inscription at the end of the British Raj era. However, Rahman and his son never revealed anything about this precious collection before handing it over to the national museum.""The committee has identified the historic stone inscription as a part of its research work. The committee has further discovered four stone inscriptions about Dhaka currently stored in different museums which were also considered lost,"" Professor Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique, chairman of the committee and former vice chancellor of Dhaka University, told The Daily Star.A team of researchers led by Mawlana Muhammad Nuruddin Fatehpuri identified these lost artefacts and deciphered the Arabic, Persian and Urdu inscriptions.According to sources, two stone inscriptions were attached to Bara Katra's two main gates. The inscription on the southern gate stated the year of its construction and the northern gate's inscription was about the endowment of the property.While the northern gate has become dilapidated, the southern gate of Bara Katra remains comparatively intact.There is a 18-line poetry written in Nastaliq script in the stone inscription that mentions the construction year of the palace. The inscription was engraved in 18 different black stone tablets which were attached around the dome of the southern gate of the palace.The stone inscription of the northern gate of the palace was written in prose, in Tughra script. In this script, Abul Qashim Al Hussaini Attabatayi Assemani is named as the architect of the palace.The transliteration and translation of the stone inscription of the northern gate were first published in Charles D'Oyly's book 'Antiquities of Dhaka' in 1822.While the stone inscription was in the national museum, it was assumed that it was lost. The fragmented pieces of it were preserved in two wooden frames separately, preventing researchers from deciphering them. Renowned historian Syed Muhammed Taifoor published a book titled 'Glimpses of Old Dhaka' in 1956 where he stated that the stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra was lost. Other historians, referring to Taifoor have also confirmed that the inscription was lost.As part of discovering Dhaka's history, the committee studied many stone inscriptions preserved in the museums of Bangladesh and West Bengal. During their study, they reviewed the documents about stone inscriptions preserved in the Bangladesh National Museum and contacted the family members who had donated the inscriptions.In this process, they came to know that the stone inscription preserved in the museum was the actual stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra.According to Bangladesh National Museum records, Hakim Irtizar Rahman Khan, the eldest son of Hakim Habibur Rahman Khan donated the stone tablet with the inscription, to the museum on April 14, 1967. It was fragmented into 12 small pieces. Hakim Irtizar Rahman Khan died on July 30, 1980.""If the fragments of the stone tablet preserved in the museum can be arranged sequentially, then the inscription can be deciphered easily,"" Mawlana Muhammad Nuruddin Fatehpuri said while explaining why it took so long to find it.Renowned photographer Mahfuzur Rahman Khan, in a 2015 interview, told the committee that his grandfather Hakim Habibur Rahman Khan collected that stone inscription and his father, Hakim Irtizar got the inscription from his father. However, they could not give any information about how Hakim Habibur Rahman Khan obtained the stone inscription.The inscription, written in Persian, read, ""Sultan Shah Shuja dedicated himself to different types of charitable activities. Abul Qashim Al Hussaini Attabatayi Assimani endowed this holy place and 22 of its adjacent shops as Waqf. And, according to Islamic laws, he stated a specific condition-that the trustee of the property will spend all the earnings from the property and the adjacent shops for the maintenance of the building and for the welfare of the poor. If an impoverished person arrives here, the person shall be offered free accommodation and shall not be charged for any services so that the trustee will get the rewards on the Day of Judgement. If anyone violates this condition, the person will be held accountable on the Day of Judgement. The engraver of the inscription is Sa'duddin and the inscription was engraved in 1055 Mohammedan Year."" (Translated from Persian to Bengali by Muhammad Nuruddin Fatehpuri)
Hakim Habibur Rahman authored a number of books on Dhaka. However, none of them carries any reference to the stone inscription of the northern gate of Bara Katra.
According to researcher Hashem Sufi, Hakim Habibur Rahman collected stone inscriptions from various places in Dhaka and donated them to museums.
During the Mughal era, Bara Katra was used as the caravanserai for travellers and merchants. However, its occupants changed over time. Some of the subadars of the late Mughal era also resided in this palace. Nawabs of Dhaka also used it as their residence before the construction of Nimtali palace. At one point, the palace became a shelter for homeless people.
At present, the southwest part of the palace is being used as a madrasa and the southeast part of the palace is occupied by local goons. They have built numerous shops, factories and warehouses and destroyed much of the original structure of the palace.
Recently, one of the current occupants started to demolish one of the remaining parts of the palace. Fortunately, on September 11, Rakhi Roy, regional director of the department of archaeology, and his team stopped them. Later, Barrister Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation paid a visit to Bara Katra and Chhoto Katra. Director General of the directorate of archaeology Ratan Chandra Pandit and architectural historian Professor Dr Abu Sayeed M Ahmed also accompanied him.

""Bara Katra must be preserved under government custody. It can be given to the custody of the city corporation or the district administration or even to the directorate of archaeology. But it cannot be handed over to any individual,"" the DSCC mayor said during the visit.
He acknowledged that negligence of government agencies has allowed the palace to be damaged and promised to preserve it.
Professor Dr AAMS Arefin Siddique welcomed the mayor's visit and commitment.
""Bara Katra and Chhoto Katra are two of our greatest heritages and archaeological assets of Dhaka. We should not change their original structure in the name of renovation and modernisation. Renovation works should be done under the supervision of an expert committee so that the original structure of the building can be maintained,"" he said.
Ratan Chandra Pandit, director general of the directorate of archaeology explained the challenges of preserving the structure to The Daily Star.
""The directorate of archaeology is responsible for the maintenance of Bara Katra. However, it is not the current owner of the land of Bara Katra. Whenever our officials go to renovate the structure, they face strong resistance from the current occupants. The archaeology department took an initiative to acquire the land of Bara Katra in 2009, but it failed. We will take another initiative to acquire the land. We have the expertise and resources to preserve and maintain Bara Katra but we need cooperation from the City Corporation, district administration, waqf administration and local people,"" he added.

/satireday/news/bcb-chief-angry-team-failed-prepare-fail-3132201,"B,CB chief angry as team failed to prepare to fail","The chief of Board, Cricket Board (B,CB) was reportedly livid after the national team went to the Middle East and won both matches against lower-ranked opposition.  The Team beat United Dictatorships of Sandyland (UDS) in two T20Is that were supposed to be preparation for this month's T20 World Cup in Australia.""Listen, I believe in preparing properly. I said earlier that they [the Team] would go to Australia as part of a study tour, to get learnings for the next T20 World Cup,"" B,CB President Kamrul Kaman Phappa told reporters during a press conference in his bedroom.""You have heard of the old adage, 'You learn more from defeats than you do from victories'. I have a long-term vision. Our team will lose so much, day in day out, home and abroad, in Tests, ODIs and T20Is, that one day they will become the most wisdomous cricket team in the world.""Then, you will see, this team will be world champions. That is also what Jamshed Mahmud Hahaha meant when he said we can be world champions,"" Phapa said.The Team went to UDS and almost succeeded in losing their first match against a team that rarely plays top-class opposition. UDS's lack of exposure to non-top-class opposition continued with the series against the Team.But in the second match, the Team beat UDS by a handy margin, and this is what infuriated Phappa.""We sent them there for a confidence boost, so that they learn that no matter how inexperienced the opposition, they can still lose. But okhantay, they ended up winning 2-0. What is the use in sending them business class to a country if they are only going to win. I admit that they tried hard to fail in the first match. But it was a shameful display in the second game.""I have worked so hard to not work hard, so that the Team can gain valuable knowledge from losing. I have instructed groundsmen to prepare poor pitches, I have ensured that there is absolutely no development in domestic cricket, and this mostly works. The Team loses most of the time.""If there is one thing I can't stand, it is winning. It gives me sleepless nights,"" Phappa said, switched off the bedside lamp and went to sleep to the white noise of the hum of cameras and murmurs of reporters."
/rohingya-influx/news/myanmar-conflicts-hurting-bangladesh-3132071,Myanmar conflicts hurting Bangladesh,"Conflicts in Myanmar intensified after the military coup on February 1 last year, as pro-democracy activists, the armed wing of National Unity Government and three dozen ethnic armed groups began fighting the junta.The Arakan Army, which was maintaining a ceasefire since November 2020, engaged in conflicts with the military from the middle of this year.The conflict has escalated to the point that there have been instances of mortar shells landing on Bangladesh's side of the border.Given that Bangladesh has been negotiating for repatriation of around one million Rohingya refugees, the conflict has serious implications on Bangladesh and beyond, analysts say.They observed that the Myanmar military is losing the public trust it enjoyed for decades. The junta has also become weaker while fighting the combines of the NUG's armed wing Peoples' Defence Force and ethnic armed groups that have been fighting for autonomy.Now, armed groups have become stronger and are stepping up their battle for full autonomy.The Arakan Army has been able to control administration in much of Rakhine State and is now desperate to take full control of the state, which is strategically important due to its proximity to the Bay of Bengal, they observed.Shahab Enam Khan, professor of international relations at Jahangirnagar University, said the junta also could not deliver on the five-point ASEAN consensus, including ending violence and restoring democracy. Also, the economy is suffering, and that is affecting Rakhine, already a cash-starved region.Harvard University Fellow Anu Anwar, an expert on Myanmar and China, said the Myanmar military had for decades been able to maintain territorial integrity despite being in a civil war with various armed groups.""What is new is the addition of new rebel groups, intensification of fighting in Arakan, and the emergence of NUG's armed wing. Most importantly, [there is] a tacit consensus among major armed groups on a common enemy -- military junta. Therefore, certainly this time the challenge is much greater.""Free Rohingya Coalition Co-founder Nay San Lwin, who is based in Germany, said the Burmese youths are much more united now against the Myanmar junta -- a reality that reflects the unity among the wider public of Myanmar. He thinks in the long run, the military will not last.Prof Shahab Anam said Myanmar is moving towards massive chaos as the military is failing to properly handle the situation. Eventually, chaos may lead to disintegration of Myanmar, he said.The intensified fighting will severely affect Myanmar's economy, which is already in a bad shape after the Covid-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions amid the Russia-Ukraine war. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the conflicts across Myanmar, while several thousands were killed.Prof Shahab said so far, mostly the Rohingyas have been the victims of conflicts in Rakhine State, but now Rakhine Buddhists are also becoming victims. Therefore, there is a real possibility of displacement of hundreds of thousands in Rakhine State.In that case, Bangladesh and Myanmar's other neighbours have reasons to worry.Anu Anwar said the intensified fighting certainly accelerated the possibility of disintegration.He said geo-strategically, Myanmar connects South and Southeast Asia with the Bay of Bengal. For economic, connectivity, and geopolitical reasons, regional powers such as Japan or India and superpowers like the US, China and Russia take a greater interest in Myanmar affairs.""A conflict in Myanmar will have multidimensional effects on the regional geopolitics…""Bangladesh, in particular, will be the primary victim of any conflict in and around Myanmar. A turmoil in Myanmar will not only increase the chances of a fresh influx of Rohingyas but also create the real possibility of an active conflict between two armed forces along the Naf River.""Anwar said there has never been any real hope of repatriation regardless of the regime in Naypyitaw. Not a single leader in Myanmar has ever taken meaningful initiative towards reparation.The only time Myanmar has taken the Rohingya issue seriously was in 1978, when the government of Bangladesh made a credible threat that unless Myanmar took back their people, Bangladesh would arm Rohingyas, and if necessary, Bangladesh's military would launch a pre-emptive strike against Burma. Since then, Bangladesh has pursued only diplomatic means, but that has produced no substantial results as the number of Rohingya refugees only increased, he said.""A fresh crackdown in Rakhine will not only tarnish the dying hope of repatriation but will generate a real possibility of a further influx of millions of Rohingyas into Bangladesh.""Shahab Enam Khan and Naw San Lwin said Rohingyas will not be willing to return to Myanmar when conflicts are escalating there.The experts said Myanmar's violation of territorial sovereignty and Rohingya repatriation are separate issues and should be dealt with separately.Anu Anwar said defending the land, air, and maritime boundary of a country is the duty of the armed forces.Shahab said Bangladesh should have deployed troops for deterrence and strongly raised Myanmar's violation of sovereignty with the UN.""Bangladesh needs to build a coalition of countries that support Bangladesh to mount pressure on Myanmar and work for Rohingya repatriation,"" he said, adding that bilateral negotiation is not working anymore.Nay San Lwin thought the same.Shahab Enam said Myanmar faced various sanctions because of the genocide against Rohingyas and military coup, mainly from western countries. Now, despite good relations, world powers like China and Russia, and even Japan, India and ASEAN are feeling uneasy about Myanmar.But it is likely that Myanmar's resources will still continue to attract them more than those of Bangladesh, he said.Anu Anwar said Beijing and Moscow provided cushion for the junta, which is nothing new. However, the new aspect is that world support for Bangladesh has increased in a dramatic fashion over the last few years.""Myanmar's isolation is a win for Bangladesh if Dhaka is able to seize the opportunity,"" he said."
/weekend-read/news/the-colourful-history-bara-katra-3132216,The colourful history of Bara Katra ,"""Katra"" is a Persian word that means caravanserai or roadside inn. Multiple katras were constructed during Mughal and Nawabi eras in Dhaka. Of them, Bara Katra and Chhoto Katra are mentionable.According to historians, Bara Katra was constructed in 1643-1644 CE/ 1053 AH by Abul Qashim who was ordered by the then subadar (Mughal provincial governor) prince Shah Shuja. Shuja constructed it for his official residence. However, the Mughal prince did not like the palace and donated it to Abul Qashim who converted it into a caravanserai. The palace was endowed for charitable purposes in 1645-46 CE/ 1055 AH.Bara Katra was located in between the Buriganga River and Chawk Bazaar. The river used to flow along the southern side of the palace even three centuries after its construction. The flow of the river was diverted due to the construction of an embankment to protect Dhaka from annual flooding. Later, human settlements mushroomed along the embankment and all around the palace. At present, the Bara Katra is located at Bara Katra Lane in Ward number 30 of Dhaka South City Corporation.Bara Katra is an ideal depiction of the Mughal architectural style. The two-stoey building was erected around an open rectangular courtyard. The palace overlooks the Buriganga River. There were two gates on the southern and northern corners of the palace and two small gateways on the western and eastern sides. "
/star-literature/news/the-hangings-victoria-park-3132191,The Hangings at Victoria Park,"Dhaka, 1857          If they'd been in Delhi or Meerut or Lucknow, maybe they'd see and hear a different story. If they'd fought at Kanpur they'd at least have had a chance to prove themselves. Here in Dhaka, inside this unfinished dream of a grieving father, another of the Mughal breed, all they could do was wait – wait to be disarmed, as word had had all hackles raised that British marines were on their way to take away their guns.Of course that bastard Nawab Abdul Ghani sided with the British, of course he did. What else to expect from a line of thieves that let the British in to begin with. Royal charter. Trading firm. One clot of bandits making blood deals with another. The age-old order of things.Sharif had been listening to a huddle of his comrades for the last endless hour, spinning the same few thoughts around and around like a thrashing, dying chicken. They'd called his name a few times to get him in on the nonsense, but he ignored them and closed his eyes. Their plans of doing this and doing that when they finally shed the Company's uniform would be laughable if he didn't actually pity them for it.He'd drifted off. In a gauzy dream Usha came to him, beckoning. That was all he wanted, to answer her summons. Life would be complete. He'd left home to get away from the vipers of his squabbling clan. His brothers tearing at each other over square inches of land, their wives in a battle of their own hurling curses, spitting spells. Thank God, his parents were gone. Dead no doubt from anguish, but out of the fray, God-willing better off. Usha, the one, the only, his sole reason to make it out alive.""Rise and shine, Subhedar Qureshi, rise and shine."" The gently mocking tone split the night to blinding day. Sharif smelled them before he saw them, not needing to open his eyes even fully to know what he would see. The house, the paltry yard, the remnants of the fire, Sharif's money, still on the ground where he'd laid it at the old man's feet, were surrounded by white faces, one of whom, the one with the morning's greetings, held the rifle Sharif had dropped somewhere along the way. ""Rise and shine, Subhedar Qureshi, rise and shine."" The gently mocking tone split the night to blinding day. Sharif smelled them before he saw them, not needing to open his eyes even fully to know what he would see. The house, the paltry yard, the remnants of the fire, Sharif's money, still on the ground where he'd laid it at the old man's feet, were surrounded by white faces, one of whom, the one with the morning's greetings, held the rifle Sharif had dropped somewhere along the way. A roar, a train out of control, thunder barreling across the heavens, and he was pulled to his feet, barely getting purchase before he tumbled, and smacked against a snarling white face. The horde of them were here and up ahead a dust storm kicked up by scuffling boots and dragging bodies had the world obscured. Sharif was sure his dream of Usha had slipped into a nightmare choked with British marines, that he wasn't actually awake and stumbling around for balance while the marine barked and tussled with him. But he was wide awake, had gotten to his feet, had shouted back that he was not laying down arms. The huddle of fellow sepoys had done the same, defied orders to surrender and Sharif blind with sleep and fury had charged into the fray.Looking him up and down the old farmer frowned.""You ran here from Dhaka?""""I've been running for days.""""Why?""""To get away from people.""The old man may have rasped a laugh, it was impossible to tell, the sickness in his chest a sucking void. He'd not believed Sharif was who he said he was.""Qureshi? The Qureshis? You? Looking like that?""""I'm a sepoy.""""I can see that. Which then? Qureshi or sepoy?""""Both.""""Go from here."" The farmer started closing the door.From inside a boot Sharif produced a wad of cash.""Are you trouble?""""Only for myself. Please,"" Sharif counted out enough to pay the farmer's taxes for the year and the ones in arrears.""You look thirsty,"" the old man said.Sharif watched him and a young boy that had appeared out of the miserable hut build a fire, sipping water from an earthen cup. The night was cool. Neither the farmer nor the boy had more than rags to keep them warm. The boy had eyed Sharif's uniform several times with pupils brightly alert in a face that was dead before its time.The farmer was the boy's grandfather. The boy's father, mother, and older brother had been killed by their landlord's overseers. The old man and the boy were spared to keep on working, paying the taxes. Gnarled from shoulders to ankles, the old man often shook with pain, and the boy could barely stand for lack of food.Sharif held out the rest of the money, which the farmer noted but didn't reach for. Sharif placed it at his feet.The boy tugged at Sharif's elbow. He led him to the darkness of the surrounding fields and pointed at the night.""Okay, I'll leave,"" Sharif said.""No,"" the old man said. ""That's not it. He wants you to look.""There was nothing but a starless, moonless sky and land unknown to him. The boy kept pointing, like a command to run.""I see nothing.""""They're out there, under the soil. He wants you to know. His family.""Appeased enough, the boy left Sharif and returned to the old man's side and warmed his hands by the fire mirroring how the man held his.""What is a rich man's son doing in the Company's army? Can't think of a better way to die?""""I didn't want to be a rich man's son.""The old man stared at the fire, the fire glinting double in his tired but alert eyes. The same eyes as the boy's.""You're landlords, you Qureshis.""""Yes.""""Big ones.""Sharif said nothing.""How do you treat your people like me?""""We should do better.""Later, after the man and boy were asleep, Sharif went the way the boy had pointed with a lantern. A breeze stroked the back of his neck, teased and threatened the lantern flame. Fifty or so feet later, Sharif stopped and made a circle with the light held above his head. He would think there would be some disturbance on the ground, earth interrupted, to indicate the graves. The lantern was pointless. The night was too fiercely dark to let it shine on all it hid.When he walked back to the house he saw that he hadn't gone that far, maybe a hundred yards. He killed the lantern and sat with his back against the house, looking out in the direction he had come from hours before.He went in and out of sleep, the state of being in neither one nor the other bringing Usha and taking her away over and over, making him start awake each time and finding that she wasn't there after all, that the veil had fallen again and again between the place of dreaming and the real.""Rise and shine, Subhedar Qureshi, rise and shine."" The gently mocking tone split the night to blinding day. Sharif smelled them before he saw them, not needing to open his eyes even fully to know what he would see.  The house, the paltry yard, the remnants of the fire, Sharif's money, still on the ground where he'd laid it at the old man's feet, were surrounded by white faces, one of whom, the one with the morning's greetings, held the rifle Sharif had dropped somewhere along the way.They called it a trial. There was a woman, the sole woman. None of the men could figure out her crime – anymore, for that matter, than they could their own. But one more time today, the judgement was in their hands. Their laws, allowing them to call the sepoys' Rebellion Mutiny. One more time, as the hood darkened Sharif's eyes, there was Usha, in a flash, among the throngs watching the gallows at the park.  Nadeem Zaman is the author of the novel In the Time of the Others (long listed for the 2019 DSC Prize in South Asian Literature) and the story collection Up in the Main House & Other Stories.

Of this period, 13 hours must be spent on providing direct lessons to students on average.This has been stipulated by a policy, drawn up by the University Grants Commission in order to fix the teaching workload of all faculty members of the public universities.The policy titled ""Teaching load calculation policy for public university teachers"" has been prepared to keep teachers on the campus for a longer period and determine how many teachers are needed for a particular university for proper education and research.Under the policy, a professor's direct teaching hour will be 10 hours, an associate professor's 12 hours, an assistant professor's 14 hours and a lecturer's 16 hours, said UGC officials.Besides lecturing at classes, each teacher will have to conduct student counseling for one hour per week.UGC officials said once the policy comes into force next week, teachers' stay on the campus and their engagement with students will increase significantly.The policy will be sent to all public universities by next week.According to officials, there are allegations that many public university teachers do not spend enough time on the campus, and teach at private universities instead. Many even take classes at five-six private universities. Some of them spend time on consultancy jobs.""We hope that public university teachers will stay at the campus for a longer time following the implementation of the policy,"" said Ferdous Zaman, secretary of UGC.He said that a UGC meeting on Tuesday finalised the policy.Commission officials also said that sufficientnumber of teachers is essential for ensuing proper educational and research activities at public universities. The policy has been devised to ensure this. It will also be helpful in determining the number of teachers needed for any particular university.""Following the implementation of the policy, it will be easier to determine how many teachers will be required for the higher education institutions. In addition, this policy will play an important role in preparing organograms of different departments of universities. Renowned academicians have cooperated with the UGC in formulating this policy,"" said Prof Dil Afroza Begum, acting chairman of UGC.There are 15,500 teachers at 53 public universities. About 3.50 lakh students study at 50 of those universities.In the policy, a teacher's weekly 40 work hours has been divided into two parts -- Contact Hours and Non-Contact Hours. The 40 hours included five hours for prayers and lunch break.Under the Contact Hours, a teacher will have to deliver lectures at the classroom, give lessons at practical classes, hold tutorial classes, and supervise projects, internships or thesesof students for 13 hours per week.A teacher's Non-contact Hourswould cover preparation of course materials, conducting research, writing articles and books, preparing questions, evaluating exam answer scripts and attending academic and administrative meetings.The policy says that the Contact Hoursfor the head of a department and institution will be six hours.Universities will be able to apply to the UGC for having 20 percent additional teachers for a particular department or institute, if there is a possibility of disruption in educational activities due to study leave of a large number of teachers, it adds.Universities will file such applications based on teaching load calculation of a particular department or institution.According to the policy, if the number of teachers working in a particular department is found bigger after calculation of teaching load, the additional number of teachers will continue in their jobs till retirement.UGC Secretary Ferdous said there were serious problems regarding determining how many teachers were needed due to absence of a policy.""We have seen that 10 teachers were recruited against the requirement of five. In other cases, five teachers were appointed against the required 10,"" he said.UGC officials said a policy of workload of teachers at Indian universityis in place. A full-time teacher's working hours should not be less than 40 hours a week for 30 working weeks in an academic year, and the teacher must be available for at least five hours daily in the university/college.Under the policy, professors and associate professors need to give 14 hours of direct teaching per week, whereas for assistant professors the requirement is 16 hours.Prof Nizamul Hoque Bhuiyan, general secretary of the Federation of Bangladesh University Teachers Association, said they would be able to comment on whether the policy was bad or good only after it came into force.""We have to improve the quality of education and the international rankings of the universities. To achieve these goals, we will need to conduct innovative researches and introduce research-oriented education…if we can use the working hours positively, it will be good for us,"" said Nizamul, also the general secretary of Dhaka University Teachers Association."

It will still be very hard, going forward. And I can 100 percent confirm it is not because of drugs. But, how do you tell what's a crime? Like where's the rulebook? Plus, even if there was one, who's to say if a crime equals injustice? Also, does something need to be a crime before I can start tapping someone's phone or going through their Snapchat? Regardless, we will do our best to rid this city and country of crime very soon,"" said Bokul Ahmed. When informed by the field reporter that the legal definition and rules for what constitutes a crime are written in law, and then further questioned regarding the aforementioned ""suspicious investigations"", our field reporter was immediately arrested on the spot by the chief. The chief also looked straight into all the cameras while forcefully handcuffing our colleague -- at the time of writing this article, he is now a former colleague, as he has already been sentenced to prison without bail. ""You're under arrest for obstruction of justice,"" screamed Bokul, ensuring that all other media personnel were aware of what was going on. He once again gave a deathly stare into the camera before adding, ""And with this, crime just got a little lower in this town."" Former super court judge and current minister of home affairs jointly released a statement following the events.  ""This transition has not been easy. We've always put the people first, and now we are going to put them a little further ahead. Also, going through all of these laws is crazy! Did you know it's a crime to exchange favours if you're in public service? That's insane!! But, going forward, we will ensure that we at least strictly uphold most of these laws, with a few amendments here and there. The country is moving forward. Soon, we shall touch the upper echelons of civilised society, as Beka City moves closer to being free of all crime."" Shortly after the joint press release, the Bureau of Numbers reported a database showcasing that crime had plummeted to zero. "

The result will be announced on October 19.As things stand, 80-year-old Kharge appears emerging a favourite as he is thought to be enjoying the tacit blessings of the Gandhi family.What has further strengthened Kharge's candidature is that his nomination papers were signed by a number of members from the Group of 23 leaders comprising Anand Sharma, Prithviraj Chavan, Manish Tewari and Bhupinder Hooda who have called for organizational changes.Kharge is a hardcore loyalist of the Gandhi family. If elected, he will be the second AICC president from Karnataka after S Nijalingappa, and also a Dalit leader to hold the post after Jagjivan Ram.Tharoor, 66, was also a part of G-23 but it seems he has been left by his group colleagues to cut a lonely furrow as none of them endorsed his nomination papers filed on the last day of nomination filing yesterday.This would be the first time a person from outside the Gandhi clan would head the grand old party after a long hiatus.The Gandhi family did not go on record to convey its favourite candidate among the three.  Neither Sonia nor Rahul Gandhi nor Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was present when the three candidates filed nomination papers because they did not want to be publicly seen as taking sides.But Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, considered close to the Gandhi family, said yesterday that all senior leaders had decided to back Kharge.""All senior leaders have together decided on Kharge's candidature,"" Gehlot told reporters in New Delhi.Tharoor, who was also part of the G-23 group, filed five sets of nomination papers while Tripathi filed a single set of poll papers with Madhusudan Mistry, the chairman of the Congress's Central Election Authority.Tharoor said he has a vision to strengthen the Congress which should be a vehicle for ""change."""

A defiant Vladimir Putin proclaimed Russia's annexation of a swathe of Ukraine in a pomp-filled Kremlin ceremony yesterday, promising Moscow would triumph in its ""special military operation"" against Kyiv even as some of his troops faced potential defeat. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Putin's proclamation of Russian rule over about 15 percent of Ukraine -- the biggest annexation in Europe since the second world war -- has been firmly rejected by Western countries and even many of Russia's close allies.
 








The declaration has been condemned by the West and prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to request fast-track Nato membership.



In one of the toughest anti-American speeches the Russian president has delivered in more than two decades in power, he signalled he was ready to continue a battle for a ""greater historical Russia"" using whatever tools he had at his disposal and slammed the West as neo-colonial and Satanist.

Photo: AFP
Putin said the US had set a precedent when it had dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945, but stopped short of issuing new nuclear warnings against Ukraine himself, something he has done more than once in recent weeks.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had not yet seen Russia take any action that suggested it is contemplating the use of nuclear weapons, despite what he called Putin's ""loose talk.""



""Truth is on our side. Russia is with us!"" Putin told his country's political elite, who had gathered in one of the Kremlin's grandest halls to watch him sign documents annexing four Ukrainian regions.
The ceremony culminated in the 69-year-old leader chanting ""Russia Russia!"" as he clasped the hands of the four Russian-backed officials he wants to run the annexed regions, which Ukraine is fighting to win back.
""People living in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region are becoming our compatriots forever,"" said Putin, referring to the four Ukrainian regions which he said Russia was annexing.
""We will defend our land with all our strength and all our means,"" he said, calling on ""the Kyiv regime to immediately cease hostilities and return to the negotiation table"".
Zelensky, speaking in Kyiv, said he was ready for peace talks if and when Russia got a new president and announced that Ukraine was formally applying for fast-track membership of the Nato military alliance, something Moscow fiercely opposes.
Kyiv's move to join Nato was the pretext that Putin used for the offensive he launched on February 24.
""We have already proven our compatibility with (Nato) alliance standards,"" Zelensky said in a video posted by the Ukrainian presidency on social media.
""We are taking a decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to Nato,"" he added.
Zelensky and the West have condemned referendums that Moscow held in the four Ukrainian regions as illegal shams, while several dozen Ukrainians interviewed by Reuters in the last week said that only people they described as ""Russian collaborators"" had voted, with most people boycotting them.
US President Joe Biden condemned Russia's ""fraudulent"" declaration, vowing to keep backing Kyiv army.
""We will continue to support Ukraine's efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically,"" he said.
Washington yesterday announced new ""severe"" sanctions against Russian officials and the country's defence industry.
The latest sanctions come on top of sweeping measures already imposed by the US and allies this year that have already crippled Russia's international trading and local economy. But they stop short of Russia's energy industry, the country's largest source of hard currency.
Guidance from the US Treasury and Commerce departments warned that anyone outside Russia, including companies, that provide political, economic or material support to Moscow faced a heightened risk of sanctions.
The Treasury sanctions generally freeze any US assets of those designated and bar Americans from dealing with them.
Commerce added 57 entities in Russia and Crimea to bar exports.
Treasury said it imposed sanctions on 14 people in Russia's military-industrial complex, two leaders of the central bank, family members of top officials and 278 members of the legislature ""for enabling Russia's sham referenda and attempt to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory.""
Canada yesterday announced measures against dozens of oligarchs, financial elites and their family members, and 35 Russian-backed senior officials in the regions where the referendums took place.
Britain also put sanctions on the governor of the Russian central bank and imposed bans on new services and goods export.
Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said recent actions by Russia constitute the most serious escalation of the conflict since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February.
""This land grab is illegal and illegitimate. Nato allies do not and will not recognize any of this territory as part of Russia,"" Stoltenberg said.
""Putin has mobilised hundreds of thousands of more troops, engaged in irresponsible nuclear sabre-rattling and now illegally annexed more Ukrainian territory. Together, this represents the most serious escalation since the start of the war,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference.
However, he said the decision on Ukraine's Nato membership requires ""consensus"" of allies.
G7 and EU also said they would ""never recognise"" Russia's annexation of four more regions in Ukraine and pledged further sanctions against Moscow.
Despite warnings from Putin prior to the annexation that he could use nuclear weapons to defend the captured territories, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would ""continue liberating our land and our people"".
In central Moscow, at least 10,000 people convened for state-organised annexation celebrations, with huge banners emblazoned: ""Donetsk. Lugansk. Zaporizhzhia. Kherson. Russia!""
A concert in Red Square was replete with military and pomp and patriotic songs and throngs of Russians waving the national flag.
The four territories create a crucial land corridor between Russia and the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014.
The Kremlin said it ""needed to clarify"" the exact borders of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- neither fully controlled by Moscow's forces -- that it intends to annex.
Together, all five regions including Crimea, make up around 20 percent of Ukraine, whose forces in recent weeks have been clawing back wins as part of a counter-offensive.
The UN Security Council was scheduled to vote later yesterday on a resolution condemning the referendums, according to France, the council's current president, but it has no chance of passing due to Moscow's veto power.

Russia!""A concert in Red Square was replete with military and pomp and patriotic songs and throngs of Russians waving the national flag.The four territories create a crucial land corridor between Russia and the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014.The Kremlin said it ""needed to clarify"" the exact borders of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- neither fully controlled by Moscow's forces -- that it intends to annex.Together, all five regions including Crimea, make up around 20 percent of Ukraine, whose forces in recent weeks have been clawing back wins as part of a counter-offensive.The UN Security Council was scheduled to vote later yesterday on a resolution condemning the referendums, according to France, the council's current president, but it has no chance of passing due to Moscow's veto power."
/sports/football/news/guardiola-reveals-secret-haalands-success-3132261,Guardiola reveals secret to Haaland's success,"Pep Guardiola says Manchester City's medical staff are the secret behind Erling Haaland's blistering start with the Premier League champions.Haaland has hit the ground running with 14 goals in nine appearances in all competitions since joining City from Borussia Dortmund in the close-season.Although the 22-year-old was equally prolific at Dortmund, he often found his hot streaks derailed by niggling injury problems.Aware of those fitness issues, City boss Guardiola has made it a priority to ensure his medical staff keep Haaland fit and firing on all cylinders.So far the Norway striker has started every game for City and Guardiola said: ""Everyone is important but I've always said to the club that the most important department in the backroom staff is the physios. They take care of the legs.""Erling struggled a lot in Dortmund last season with injuries and arrived here with little problems after a small surgery in the summer.""He started to work here with (physiotherapist) Mario (Pafundi) and the other guys and thanks to them -- and of course his work ethic -- he can play regularly now. Last season it was not possible.""When the players can play most of the time, it's thanks to the physios.""Pafundi's role is so important to Guardiola, the physio travelled with Haaland during his recent two-week spell on international duty with Norway.""It's not weird. At events like World Cups and European Championships, many physios go with the players, and Mario is an exceptional physio,"" Guardiola said.While Haaland has benefitted from his time with City's medical gurus, fellow pre-season signing Kalvin Phillips remains on the sidelines.The England midfielder had an operation to correct a recurring shoulder problem during the international break after playing just 14 minutes since arriving from Leeds.Guardiola is hopeful Phillips can return in time for the World Cup.""He is feeling good. The surgery was really good and the mobility is getting better,"" he said.""He took the right decision, otherwise he could not move forward. Now it's solved this problem and as soon as he is ready he can come back, hopefully in time to go to the World Cup.""City defender John Stones is also out of Sunday's derby against Manchester United after suffering a hamstring injury with England.Guardiola expects Stones to be absent for ""maybe 10 days, two weeks""."

/news/bangladesh/news/the-fight-save-their-field-3132146,The fight to save their field,"For decades, the residents of Mirpur-11 have made themselves well-acquainted with the only open space they have, the one located on Paris Road. Many grew up playing there every day after school, and many made lifelong friends and memories after spending hours on end in the field.Fourteen places had been earmarked as playgrounds, parks or fields in Mirpur. But they were turned into plots in 1994, as per the decision of then housing minister, violating the master plan and depriving local residents.This place was one of them.""This field on Paris Road was also turned into plots at that time. But we've been trying to protect the place since then,"" said Kazi Jahirul Islam Manik, ward-3 councillor of Dhaka North City Corporation.Manik said the three lakh residents of ward-3 do not have any field or park aside from this open space.And so, for a long time locals have been waging a fight, demanding the government protect their lone field, he added. Recently, after the new DAP was gazetted last month, their protest got momentum as the place has been designated as an open space there.Locals also organised a human chain and hunger strike to save the place, which was allotted to a section of people, violating the master plan of Dhaka Improvement Trust 1963.Currently the space remains abandoned, with piled up garbage  dumped there.""This land was earmarked as an open space in the 1963 master plan. It's also an open space in the new Detailed Area Plan,"" said Manik.Manik initiated a hunger strike on Thursday. A large number of people, including students, teachers, and guardians of 37 schools; former national football players; local clubs; and imams took part.The residents want the field to be handed over to the city corporation, no matter who the owner is. They wish for this place to turn into a proper field, he said.Sustainable Development Goals states that for every 12,500 people, a separate playground and park is a must. Going off that information, 24 such spaces are required for the ward. And yet, this is the lone playing field, Manik explained.In 2017, the prime minister issued a directive saying that this place will remain a playing field, he mentioned.The 1994 allotment is unethical and should be cancelled, Manik demanded.Ashrafun Nesa Parul, senior teacher of Jannat Academy High School, was brought up in the area. She said this field is crucial for the children's physical and mental development.""We want our children to lead a healthy life; every family here wants that,"" she added.Mohammad Anowar Hossain Ripon, principal of Mirpur Science College, said his institution has no playground or field, and locals have almost no place to play. So, the lone field is the only bastion for the youngsters. Elderly people also benefit, as they have a place for regular physical activities.Showing solidarity with the movement, DNCC Mayor Md Atiqul Islam requested the prime minister to allot the space as a playing field.The mayor, who visited the area on Thursday, said the area has over three lakh residents and around 60 educational institutes. But there is no field for them.The field is designated as an open space in the new DAP, but National Housing Authority has allotted it as plots. This is absolutely unacceptable, he said. ""We will protect this field with the support of locals.""Thirty percent of Dhaka city wards do not have any playground or park. This situation hinders the mental and physical growth of children, as they have no space to play and interact with friends, say experts.According to the DAP, 25 out of 75 wards under Dhaka South City Corporation and 10 out of 55 wards under DNCC do not have a single park or playground.About 20 million people live in the capital, and considering the population density, there should be over a dozen parks and play areas in each ward, said Adil Mohammad Khan, former general secretary of Bangladesh Institute of Planners.""But there's a dearth of open spaces, and the available places get too crowded. Ultimately, many children are discouraged to go to the few parks or playgrounds we have,"" he explained."
/news/world/usa/news/hurricane-ian-dumped-10pc-more-rain-due-climate-change-research-3132316,Hurricane Ian dumped 10pc more rain due to climate change: research,"Climate change increased the rainfall from Hurricane Ian by more than 10 percent, according to a new quick-fire analysis, as one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the United States devastated parts of Florida.Ian ""could be the deadliest hurricane in Florida history"", President Joe Biden said after the storm brought ferocious winds, turned streets into churning rivers that swept away homes and left an unknown number of casualties.According to a rapid and preliminary analysis, human-caused climate change increased the extreme rain that Ian unleashed by over 10 percent, US scientists said.""Climate change didn't cause the storm but it did cause it to be wetter,"" said Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Michael Wehner, one of the scientists behind the new finding.The researchers compared simulations of today's world -- which has warmed nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times -- with counterfactual simulations of a world without human-induced climate change.Wehner said these were ""conservative estimates"", adding that while they are not peer reviewed, they are based on methods used in a study on the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, which was published in April in the journal Nature Communication.Climate change from emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases is warming the ocean's surface and increasing moisture in the atmosphere that fuels hurricanes.Although the total number of tropical storms, or cyclones, may not increase, scientists say warming is whipping up more powerful cyclones with stronger winds and more precipitation.""Human-caused climate change is affecting hurricanes in many ways including causing them to intensify faster, be stronger overall, and dump a lot more rain,"" tweeted climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who was not involved in the research.For each degree Celsius of warming, scientists expect the water in the atmosphere to increase by around seven percent.But Wehner said that his research found that storms are ""more efficient"" at turning the available moisture into rainfall.Ian swept across Cuba on Tuesday, downing the country's power network, before slamming into the Florida coast on Wednesday as a strong Category 4 hurricane.The National Hurricane Center said Thursday the now Category 1 storm is expected to bring ""life-threatening flooding, storm surge and strong winds"" to the Carolinas."
