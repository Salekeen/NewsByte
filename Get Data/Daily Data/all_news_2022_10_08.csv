/business/economy/opinion/news/averting-fiscal-crises-deteriorating-global-economic-environment-3138001,Averting fiscal crises in a deteriorating global economic environment,"The war in Ukraine and aftershocks from the Covid-19 pandemic present Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) with an extremely challenging external environment shaped by higher food, fertilizer, and energy prices, rising inflation and interest rates, and stagflation risks in advanced economies.Fifteen years ago, spikes in food prices, followed by the global financial crisis, and then by increases in oil prices were sequential and governments addressed each of these crisis separately as and when they occurred. Today the crises are happening all at once.Fiscal policy is the key instruments for governments to mitigate the impact of these shocks on households and businesses, as monetary policy must focus on price stability. Unfortunately, many countries have a depleted fiscal space following the Covid-19 crisis.Options to strengthen fiscal space include reallocating expenditures from lower priority programs toward programs aimed at mitigating the economic and social impacts of the war; improving the efficiency of spending; and raising revenue, including by broadening the tax base, making the tax system more progressive, and reducing tax avoidance and evasion.Even where fiscal space exists, strong inflationary pressures may limit the scope for expansionary fiscal policies. If pent-up demand is the primary driver of inflation, expansionary fiscal policies could exacerbate inflationary pressures by widening the gap between aggregate supply and demand, and so should be avoided.However, if inflation is primarily driven by increases in commodity prices, there may be scope to implement measures that address this to mitigate the impacts on the most vulnerable, especially if an economy's total output of goods and services is significantly below potential.A recent report by the World Bank's Fiscal Policy and Sustainable Growth unit sets out several key issues that can help countries design an appropriate response to these multiple adverse shocks:1. Economy of crisis mitigation measuresLevers to design fiscally sustainable response measures include: (i) affordability the extent to which the instrument impacts fiscal stability; (ii) predictability and control of cost the ability to set upper limits for the cost of a program and reasonably predict costs; (iii) targeting limiting benefits to specific businesses, population groups, or activities; (iv) abuse resistance limiting leakages; and (v) reversibility  the ease with which the response can be withdrawn when appropriate, without causing economic and behavioral distortions.2. Avoid a multiplicity of measures and prioritizeWhere adequate social protection systems exist, it will typically be most efficient to channel support to households by temporarily scaling up existing benefits. Where such systems do not exist, focusing on a priority can help avoid administrative complexity and difficulties in targeting. For many EMDEs, this may be food security.3. Avoid broad tax measuresTax measures are ill suited to mitigate hardship. Broad-based tax measures such as reductions in tax rates or tax exemptions are typically difficult to target. While increases in taxes are quickly reflected in higher consumer prices, a reduction in taxes does not lower prices (unless administrative capacity is very high). Moreover, once a tax rate is reduced, political economy constraints make it difficult to reverse, even if the rate reduction is announced as temporary.4. Review subsidy programmesSharp price increases can swell the cost of existing subsidy programs for food, fertilizer and energy, which are often not or only poorly targeted. To ensure efficient support for the most vulnerable, governments should consider reforms that enhance targeting. This involves strengthening data on vulnerable households, individuals, and businesses. While excluding beneficiaries from programs is politically difficult in an environment of rising prices, governments may at least consider differentiated levels of support based on needs.5. Energy sector interventions should not undermine climate objectivesWhen considering relief measures for high energy prices, it is important to consider the impact on climate objectives:Measures that give temporary relief from peak prices could transition to the introduction of carbon taxes to ensure carbon prices remain at level that is consistent with climate mitigation objectives in the medium- to long-termTargeted social protection measures to compensate vulnerable households facing energy price pressures are preferable to measures that reduce energy prices for consumers.Taxation of windfall gains of producers of carbon-based energy would reduce incentives for harmful investment in carbon-based energy sources.Reduced dependence on fossil fuel imports from Russia by prioritizing investments in renewable energies instead of scaling up domestic hydrocarbon production.6. Developing countries may need support from the international communityMany developing countries, and most importantly low-income and fragile countries, may need support from the international community to mitigate adverse impacts on their economies, households, and businesses. The World Bank Group's response is set out in the Global Crisis Response Framework paper, highlighting engagement in supporting countries to address these fiscal challenges through scaled-up finance, technical assistance, and analytic and advisory activities to support green, resilient, and inclusive development. This includes work on the fiscal options for crises response, monitoring the impact on the poor, design and advocacy for debt solutions for the most vulnerable countries, enhancing the resilience of financial sectors.Chiara Bronchi is a practice manager, fiscal policy and sustainable growth, macroeconomics, trade, and investment global practice at the World Bank.

/opinion/views/news/remembering-the-queens-legacy-why-do-we-forget-the-suffering-our-ancestors-3138096,"In remembering the 'Queen's legacy', why do we forget the suffering of our ancestors?","When news broke of the death of Queen Elizabeth II, international media houses couldn't stop singing her praise and seducing us with the Queen's corgis, her role as a mother and grandmother, her fashion throughout the ages, even a week after her passing.The most surprising and curious bit however, was how the people of my own nation mourned the late Queen – starting from policymakers to prominent scholars. They posed arguments such as, without the British Empire, the Indian Subcontinent may never have ""modernised"" as it was indeed the British who had introduced the railroad network that spread swiftly across the subcontinent after 1858. But that remains the only argument they could place to legitimise the crown's authority in the region. Many even said that if it weren't for the British, the Indian Subcontinent would've remained backdated. I couldn't help but heave a sigh, as these opinions too were a product of colonisation. And it was greatly concerning that as the colonised, we remember so little of our own history, so much so that we choose to make sense of our horribly gruesome past by rationalising the British authority over our region. To think that the crown had any intention to modernise the Indian Subcontinent is purely ridiculous, as it presupposes that the British Monarchy, that was seeking to consolidate its empire at the time, wasn't acting out of self-interest. In 1820, India's GDP represented 16 percent of the world's total GDP, which, by the end of the British rule in 1947 stood at just four percent. Revenue from India and the export surplus produced by India's overseas trade were used to fund the British government's military and administrative costs to govern colonial control in India. Indigo cultivation was widely extended by the British in areas of Bengal, including the districts of Nadia and Jessore. The British indigo planters, known as nilkor sahebs, persuaded the land tillers to cultivate indigo instead of food crops by leasing land from the zamindars, along with sharecroppers and tenants. Opium sales by the East India Company were incredibly exploitative and led to the destitution of over 1.3 million peasants who farmed poppies in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Rajat Kanta Roy, a modern historian, contends that the East India Company's new economy in Bengal during the 18th century was characterised by a type of ""exploitation colonialism"" that contributed to the collapse of the Mughal Empire's traditional economy by depleting food and currency stocks, and enacting high taxes that exacerbated the famine of 1770, which claimed between one and two million lives in Bengal.  Politician and historian Shashi Tharoor put this circumstance in the simplest terms, ""The reason is simple: India was governed for the benefit of Britain. Britain's rise for 200 years was financed by its depredation of India."" Besides, the regiment's self interests are blatantly clear in the way they conducted ""trade"" with our region. The EIC had forced open the Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India without tariffs or duties, whereas local Indian producers were still being heavily taxed. Britain's protectionist policies, such as bans and high tariffs to restrict Indian textiles being sold in Britain, made sure that only British wealth would aggregate and be invested into the extraction from the subcontinent. Meanwhile, the Indian subcontinent, slowly and surely became trapped in the empire's monopoly. Not only that, the rail network, by design, was made for the convenience of the British trade points at the time and had little to do with the commuters' convenience. And let's not forget one of the biggest scars left on us by the British – the Bengal Famine of 1943, that took the lives of three million of our people. For years, the British establishment had pointed fingers at frequent droughts and weather conditions of Bengal to have been responsible for this tragedy. In truth, the crisis was constructed and was mostly brought on by wartime inflation that made food unaffordable. Economist Utsa Patnaik conducted research that showed that the inflation wasn't accidental, as the majority of people believed, but rather the result of a deliberate policy created by British economist John Maynard Keynes and implemented by Winston Churchill to divert resources away from the most vulnerable Indians in order to feed British and American troops and finance war-related activities. And let's not forget, Churchill tried to blame the famine on our ancestors, emphasising that Indians were ""breeding like rabbits,"" and asking how ""if the shortages are so bad, Mahatma Gandhi was still alive?""Might I also add that the way the Indian Subcontinent was divided in a haste by the British, as they were packing up in 1947, had displaced over 15 million people and killed more than two million in the process of migration. And all because the man hired to complete the demarcation – British lawyer Cyril Radcliffe, who was a newcomer in the region – had never visited, nor cared enough about, the history of the regions he divided.What makes matters even worse is the psychological impact left on the minds of the colonised as an aftermath of the 200 years of British reign. The fact that we automatically associate ""beautiful"" or ""successful"" with the fairness of one's skin, was nailed into our heads through British rule. Lest we forget, ""Glow and Lovely"" was still ""Fair and Lovely"" until very recently. And, the fact that we prefer foreign products and deem them superior to our locally produced ones is also thanks to an imprint of British colonial rule on our psyche. So, what can we do about it? The study of decoloniality best serves this answer. In simplistic terms, decoloniality is a school of thought that critiques the perceived universality of Western knowledge and the superiority of Western culture. As a matter of fact, much of the instances discussed in this piece can be attributed to decolonial education. To think and imagine a world beyond the long-established reign of white dominance and perceived superiority. This education includes bearing an inherent scepticism of what we are told is ""truth"" and ""true knowledge"" in the world, which is crucial since much of what we know is constructed via the hands of the ones who had ruled over us. It also emphasises the need of the colonised to remember their own history – to ensure that we don't forget the turmoil that our ancestors went through, to remember that ours is a nation that was thought to be backward, and to never forget that we could've been so much more, if all that we had wasn't looted away from us. To remember and to be informed are the most important duties that the colonised bear. If we don't fulfil these duties, our own history will be erased and rewritten right before our eyes – and we won't be able to do much about it. Nazifa Raidah is a journalist and sub-editor at The Daily Star.

/opinion/views/news/shanghai-cooperation-organization-summit-2022-new-context-new-directions-3138126,"Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit 2022: New context, new directions","The Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO) 22nd annual summit of heads of states took place in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on September 15 and 16, 2022. What we have seen is that the summit was held at a very significant time since its inception, particularly as the world right now is experiencing a new reality. It took place at a time when Russia, China, and their allies are at loggerheads with the West. In fact, the West has visibly been facing a resurgent China and Russia over the past decade.Russia is currently engaged in a war against Ukraine, but the underlying fact is that the war is taking place between Russia and the West. The relationship between Russia and the West is not only marked by war but also by economic and cultural dimensions. Of course, the war is being fought according to strategic calculations. Russia has historically been tagged as a threat by the West and now the war has added a new dimension to the situation.On the other hand, the Taiwan crisis has further deteriorated, and very recently, US President Joe Biden had expressed his will to support Taiwan under any circumstances. Though the crisis in Taiwan has been somewhat defused, it continues in different forms. The Ukraine war and the Taiwan crisis have already led to different strategic and economic implications for the world.China was the one who started the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Since the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is not a formal regional or global organisation, SCO got the privilege to maintain its institutional format and has become an effective multilateral forum for China. However, as indicated above, the SCO summit 2022 becomes very significant considering the context. The presence of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi carried a strong message from the platform since his presence was not certain prior to the visit as China and India have recently fought over border issues and they remain largely hostile in the policy domain. The Ukraine war somehow put the two neighbouring rival states on a common platform, but the overall atmosphere between the two is antagonistic in nature and is marked by differences and disagreements with the divergence of threats and perceptions of security and peace.The SCO emerged as a major platform where for the first time during the time of Covid-19 the Chinese President Xi Jinping went for a bigger gathering. From that point of view, it was an opportunity for the Chinese president to meet with the Indian and the Russian leaderships in person. The platform also provides a triangular format of talks to communicate where current global issues were discussed. One of the major issues that featured prominently was the Ukraine war. The Indian prime minister asked for an end to the Ukraine war and the Russian leadership responded that they also wanted it to end.The position of India reflects different realities. The Ukraine war cannot be justified based on the United Nations charter or international law and norms. Therefore, India, or for that matter, any country, has the moral ground to ask for an end to the war. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin took it in a very diplomatic way. He responded by saying that Russia also wanted to end the war. Russia could not deny the Indian leader's concerns about the war. It was a diplomatic victory for India for two reasons. The first is that it has upheld India's recent non-aligned position that it maintains distance from bandwagoning its powerful allies in the West. The other is that it must have pleased the western world as India raised the issue of stopping the war. They might take some kind of satisfaction because Russia was under some pressure.The SCO conference carries a great deal of significance for another issue, that is, outside Europe or the West, this is the platform barring Brics that offered the opportunity to three dominant global actors – China, India and Russia – to meet in person and discuss bilateral and multilateral issues. Besides, India is expanding its sphere of influence, and China and Russia are doing the same. These three powers have formidable military and economic capabilities and they are building their own position in global politics, although they have their differences.Apart from these three, the SCO has other prominent members. Their participation was also very significant because this particular organisation is becoming the alternative to the West-led processes. Although members of SCO have affiliations with other actors like the USA, Germany, UK, France, and Australia on the one hand, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), or even Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), SCO provides some different insights. In the present context, Asian or African countries may search for a platform, which would be significant geopolitically and economically outside of Europe or the West. One cannot deny the fact that the West carries the baggage of colonial legacy and maintaining hegemony. The world had moved from the ""Pax Britannica"" to ""Pax Americana"" and is now in a flux. This forum serves as a geopolitical platform in the context of the current world order.The SCO has observer states and dialogue partners. It may soon accept new members. On a significant note, Turkiye has shown its interest to join the organisation. Therefore, the timing of the conference was very critical.The conference has particularly benefitted China and Russia, giving them the opportunity to interact with other countries including India at a point of time when the western world is trying to isolate China and Russia in different ways. From that diplomatic point of view, the summit was successful. And another diplomatic outcome is that the Chinese president visited the Central Asian countries to boost its bilateral ties. The Central Asian states have huge geopolitical importance and have closer ties with Russia. Many of them, after their independence, got assistance from the USA and the West. Despite the West's presence in the region, over the years, China and Russia have been able to maintain their dominant role in the region. The West may see this as a looming challenge to their new diplomacy and strategic manoeuvring in the world.Dr Delwar Hossain is a professor of international relations at Dhaka University and a security and global affairs analyst."

/business/news/opec-oil-output-cut-shows-widening-rift-between-biden-and-saudi-royals-3138041,OPEC+ oil output cut shows widening rift between Biden and Saudi royals,"The OPEC+ organisation's decision this week to cut oil production despite stiff US opposition has further strained already tense relations between President Joe Biden's White House and Saudi Arabia's royal family, once one of Washington's staunchest Middle East allies, according to interviews with about a dozen government officials and experts in Washington and the Gulf.The White House pushed hard to prevent the OPEC output cut, these sources said. Biden hopes to keep US gasoline prices from spiking again ahead of midterm elections in which his Democratic party is struggling to maintain control of the US Congress. Washington also wants to limit Russia's energy revenue during the Ukraine war.The US administration lobbied OPEC+ for weeks. In recent days, senior US officials from energy, foreign policy and economic teams urged their foreign counterparts to vote against an output cut, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.Amos Hochstein, Biden's top energy envoy, along with national security official Brett McGurk and the administration's special envoy to Yemen Tim Lenderking, traveled to Saudi Arabia last month to discuss energy issues, including the OPEC+ decision.They failed to prevent an output cut, just as Biden did after his own July visit.US officials ""tried to position it as 'us versus Russia,'"" said one source briefed on the discussions, telling Saudi officials they needed to make a choice.That argument failed, the source said, adding that the Saudis said that if the United States wanted more oil on the markets, it should start producing more of its own.The United States is the world's No. 1 oil producer and also its top consumer, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.The Saudi government media office CIC did not respond to Reuters emailed requests for comment about the discussions.""We are concerned first and foremost with the interests of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and then the interests of the countries that trusted us and are members of OPEC and the OPEC + alliance,"" Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz told Saudi TV Wednesday.OPEC weighs its interests with ""those of the world because we have an interest in supporting the growth of the global economy and providing energy supplies in the best way,"" he said.Washington's handling of the Iran nuclear deal and withdrawal of support for a Saudi-led coalition's offensive military operations in Yemen have upset Saudi officials, as have actions against Russia after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.A US push for a price cap on Russian oil is causing uncertainty, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Bloomberg TV after the OPEC cut, noting the ""lack of details and the lack of clarity"" about how it will be implemented.A source briefed by Saudi officials said the kingdom views it as ""a non-market price-control mechanism, that could be used by a cartel of consumers against producers.""A Biden-directed sale of 180 million barrels of oil in March from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve put downward pressure on oil prices. In March, OPEC+ said it would stop using data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), a Western oil watchdog, due to Saudi-led concerns the United States had too much influence.On Thursday, Biden called the Saudi decision ""a disappointment"", adding Washington could take further action in the oil market.""Look it's clear that OPEC Plus is aligning with Russia,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday. She would not elaborate on how the output cut would affect US-Saudi relations. In the US Congress, Biden's Democrats called for the withdrawal of US troops from Saudi Arabia and spoke about taking back weapons.""I thought the whole point of selling arms to the Gulf States despite their human rights abuses, nonsensical Yemen War, working against US interests in Libya, Sudan etc, was that when an international crisis came, the Gulf could choose America over Russia/China,"" Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, said on Twitter.Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel Al-Jubeir, said in remarks to Fox News on Friday when asked about the US criticism: ""Saudi Arabia does not politicize oil or oil decisions.""""With due respect, the reason you have high prices in the United States is because you have a refining shortage that has been in existence for more than 20 years,"" he added.CROWN PRINCE AND BIDENWeeks after Biden took office as president, Washington released a report tying the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The prince, son of King Salman, 86, has denied ordering the killing but acknowledged it took place ""under my watch"".The prince became prime minister last month and his lawyers have been arguing in a US court that this makes him immune from prosecution in the Khashoggi death.Biden's trip to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in July for a Gulf summit was aimed at patching up relations, but he also levied harsh criticism of bin Salman over Khashoggi's murder.Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Saudis hope the production cuts will give OPEC+ control over oil prices and ensure enough oil revenue to protect their country from a recession.""The macroeconomic risk is getting worse all the time, so they have to respond,"" Cahill said. ""They are aware that a cut will irritate Washington, but they are managing the market."""

""They must leave office after handing over power to a caretaker government.""Asked whether the BNP would join talks with the AL if it was invited, he said, ""There is no scope for talks until the demand of holding the national election under a non-partisan interim government is met.""Enquired when the party would wage a concerted anti-government movement, Fakhrul said, ""We are now holding talks with the opposition parties. So, we cannot say the exact time right now.""He alleged that the AL, like the other authoritarian governments in the world, has turned election into a farce to cling on to power.The BNP leader said the ruling party wants to score goals in an empty field in the next general election without the participation of the opposition parties.""She [Sheikh Hasina] wants the opposition parties not to join the election. They are used to scoring goals in empty fields and getting walkovers. We have said people will no longer accept this type of an election.""Fakhrul said BNP, as a liberal democratic party, wants to join the election but it has to be a ""genuine one, not a farce"".He said a fair and credible election cannot be held under those who stuff ballots the night before the polling day, get 154 candidates elected without voting, bar the opposition candidates from campaigning and arrest opposition leaders and activists to make the electoral field empty.""It cannot be accepted that an election will be held by creating a reign of terror…this is how military dictators prolong their stay in power as they are afraid to go to people and seek votes. This is the reality.""Under the present circumstances, the BNP leader said there is no alternative to ousting the current government through waging a united movement by the opposition parties.He said Hasina has been staying in power by deceiving and intimidating the country's people and resorting to falsehood.Fakhrul said there is no reason for the BNP to be afraid of participating in fair elections. ""Rather, they [Awami League] are worried that they will not be able to retain power if the election is held in a credible manner. That is the bottom line. That's why they are completely depriving people of voting rights by using various techniques and deceptions."""
/entertainment/tv-film/news/plus-means-positive-3138046,Plus means positive,"Tasnova Tabassum Parisa has proven that body types do not define beauty – it comes from the soul. The talented young woman won the title of ""Miss & Mrs Plus Bangladesh"". This plus size beauty pageant challenges the stereotypes of beauty standards and raises awareness against the culture of body-shaming.In an exclusive interview with Star Showbiz, Parisa talks about her journey as a plus size woman and more.How did you feel when you were announced as the winner?
When I was selected as the Top 5, I knew I could win this. But when they finally announced the winner, I went completely blank. I couldn't gather my scattered thoughts. I had to let it sink in. It was truly a magical moment.
What motivated you to join the pageant?



My biggest motivation was my mother. She always encouraged me to participate in extracurriculars. When I first heard about the pageant, I asked for her advice— should I join? She urged me to sign up for it immediately.
Since childhood, she made me learn how to sing and dance. I wanted to share these skills with the world. These are the reasons why I joined the pageant.  
You are also a dancer and a fashion influencer. Did you receive much criticism pursuing these, due to your body type?



Yes! Even as a child, I had to hear the jeering 'Why are you dancing with this body, you will break the stage'. I think all large girls can relate to this. Even now, when I am in live videos to promote products, people body shame me in the comments. Although I don't care much anymore, it is still hurtful.
 








Do you believe pageants like these can actually can help people fight against body shaming?
I think that the ""Miss & Mrs Plus Bangladesh"" pageant has already shifted people's mindset. Viewers are now more aware of the fact that body types have nothing to do with anyone's worth. People who would body shame me, now congratulate me.
I think this is a big change. There is still a long way to go, and we will need a lot of time to change the perspective of an entire community. But at least the pageant has opened a dialogue.
What changes can you identify within yourself?
I was always a person who loves herself. I'm like the character Geet in the film ""Jab We Met"". However, after the pageant, I find myself feeling more confident about my body. Now I know how to present myself in a more subtle manner. I feel less insecure about how I look, and more confident about how I am as a person.
 








How do you deal with hate comments on your social media?
I simple: I don't care. That's a good quality of mine, I will say. As I was active on social media for a long time and I am on the healthier side, these hate comments are my constant companion. I have found that the best way to tackle it, is to avoid it. I never let these hate comments come in my way.
What do you want to say to young people, who struggle with self-confidence due to body shaming?
I want to tell them is that you have to love yourself first. You have to embrace yourself as you are. You have to tell yourself every day that you are beautiful the way you are. You can never let anyone make you believe that you aren't.
 








What do you want to do to promote body positivity in the future?
Before the pageant, I didn't put much thought to promoting body positivity in particular. As I joined the pageant and participated in the grooming classes, I encountered many women who are depressed and anxious about their body type.
This made me want to help women work on their mental health— the way the pageant's grooming classes helped me grow more confident about my body. I want to open an institution where I can teach young girls take better care of themselves, and learn ways to be more presentable.
When I was selected as the Top 5, I knew I could win this. But when they finally announced the winner, I went completely blank. I couldn't gather my scattered thoughts. I had to let it sink in. It was truly a magical moment.What motivated you to join the pageant?My biggest motivation was my mother. She always encouraged me to participate in extracurriculars. When I first heard about the pageant, I asked for her advice— should I join? She urged me to sign up for it immediately.Since childhood, she made me learn how to sing and dance. I wanted to share these skills with the world. These are the reasons why I joined the pageant.  You are also a dancer and a fashion influencer. Did you receive much criticism pursuing these, due to your body type?Yes! Even as a child, I had to hear the jeering 'Why are you dancing with this body, you will break the stage'. I think all large girls can relate to this. Even now, when I am in live videos to promote products, people body shame me in the comments. Although I don't care much anymore, it is still hurtful.Do you believe pageants like these can actually can help people fight against body shaming?
I think that the ""Miss & Mrs Plus Bangladesh"" pageant has already shifted people's mindset. Viewers are now more aware of the fact that body types have nothing to do with anyone's worth. People who would body shame me, now congratulate me.
I think this is a big change. There is still a long way to go, and we will need a lot of time to change the perspective of an entire community. But at least the pageant has opened a dialogue.
What changes can you identify within yourself?
I was always a person who loves herself. I'm like the character Geet in the film ""Jab We Met"". However, after the pageant, I find myself feeling more confident about my body. Now I know how to present myself in a more subtle manner. I feel less insecure about how I look, and more confident about how I am as a person.
 








How do you deal with hate comments on your social media?
I simple: I don't care. That's a good quality of mine, I will say. As I was active on social media for a long time and I am on the healthier side, these hate comments are my constant companion. I have found that the best way to tackle it, is to avoid it. I never let these hate comments come in my way.
What do you want to say to young people, who struggle with self-confidence due to body shaming?
I want to tell them is that you have to love yourself first. You have to embrace yourself as you are. You have to tell yourself every day that you are beautiful the way you are. You can never let anyone make you believe that you aren't.

Among the detainees were several persons who went to the hospital to take care of the injured.Abrar, a second-year student of electrical and electronic engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), died on October 7, 2019, at a dormitory after being brutally beaten by some Chhatra League activists.Witnesses said the BCL men swooped on the parishad leaders and activists in TSC area around 3:30pm soon after the rally began. At one stage, the demonstrators retaliated beating up some attackers.BCL Organising Secretary Nazim Uddin was injured in the clash.Footage of the incident showed that BCL Joint General Secretary Mahbub Khan, Organising Secretary Nazim Uddin, Human Resource Development Affairs Secretary Nahid Hasan, and Private University Affairs Secretary Al Amin Rahman led the attackers.Bin Yamin Mollah, president of Chhatra Odhikar Parishad, alleged that Chhatra League men attacked them without any provocation, leaving at least 12 activists injured.He said the attackers tore a banner apart and broke chairs and tables at the venue.""Chhatra League men also assaulted our injured leaders and activists at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital,"" Yamin added.BCL General Secretary Lekhak Bhattacharjee said he heard that a clash took place on the DU campus but was not sure who were involved.DU Proctor Prof AKM Golam Rabbani no organisation had taken permission from the university authorities for the rally.""We are aware of the incident. Our mobile team was there. We are trying to find out what happened. At the same time, law enforcement agencies have also been asked to take strict action in this regard,"" he told The Daily Star.He said the university discourages all from organising any programme that might disrupt students' safety and the educational environment.Nur Mohammad, officer-in-charge of Shahbagh Police Stations, said the 20 detainees were being interrogated at the police station.Meanwhile, Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal and Samajtantrik Chhatra Front yesterday condemned the BCL attack on the Chhatra Odhikar Parishad rally and demanded the attackers be brought to book."

/life-living/news/kamrul-islam-doctor-who-has-won-the-hearts-the-general-people-3138081,Kamrul Islam: A doctor who has won the hearts of the general people,"Free medical care and consultancy, year after year – the words may sound like fantasy but in reality, it is a benevolence that is being offered by many. One of these people is Dr Kamrul Islam, who has been winning the hearts of people across the country with his compassion. He has been performing kidney transplants free of cost for the last decade, along with providing his patients follow-up services.After retiring as an assistant professor of the National Institute of Kidney Diseases and Urology in 2011, Dr Kamrul Islam took personal initiative to establish CKD & Urology Hospital. He had dreamt of buying a car with the money saved from his days of government service, but instead, he spent the money on a dialysis machine. He also took assistance from his friends to get CKD off the ground.The institution has now become a place of trust and affection for kidney patients across the country. Kidney transplant procedures here are carried out at the small cost of two lakh and ten thousand takas only. Dr Kamrul Islam charges no money for this complicated procedure. They even provide follow-up care free of charge for patients for several months after the procedure.Professor Kamrul and his team have transplanted almost one thousand kidneys so far, with a success rate of 96 percent. Last year, when the Coronavirus pandemic brought healthcare to a standstill, Kamrul Islam and his associates still managed to transplants almost 250 kidneys. All but three of those patients are now living healthy lives.During the liberation war, Kamrul Islam's father Aminul Islam worked at Paksey Sugarcrop Research Institute. He was killed by Rajakars for helping local freedom fighters. After the death of their father, the responsibility of taking care of the children fell squarely on the shoulders of the mother.The widowed SSC-pass mother took the resolve to start studying again so that she could take care of her children and stand up on her own two feet. Soon, she completed HSC and enrolled in Rajshahi University to study Sociology. She showed her merit by finishing first in her class to achieve a Master's degree and then joined Lalmatia Women's College in 1981 as a professor.Among the four sons of Aminul and Rahima, the second one – Kamrul – was a prodigious talent. He finished his SSC from Chandraprabha Vidyapitha, Paksey in 1980, ranking 15th on the merit list. He then enrolled in Dhaka College and consequently ranked 10th on the merit list for his HSC exams. He completed his MBBS from Dhaka Medical College, and later went on to acquire FCPS (Surgery), FRCS (UK), MS (Urology) degrees.In 1993, he joined the National Institute of Kidney Diseases and Urology Hospital as a BCS (Health) cadre. He successfully performed a kidney transplant for the first time in 2007. It's interesting to note that, before taking the role of a kidney transplant surgeon, Kamrul Islam used to practice on the kidney of cattle during Eid-ul-Adha.He said, ""At first, I did not want to be a kidney transplant surgeon. But as the responsibility of a government institution fell on my shoulder, I was almost forced to become one. At first, we started with four machines to build a dialysis setup, and soon we had 30 patients who would regularly get the services. I performed a transplant for the first time on one of them, and once that was successful, the references kept on coming. Now, I regularly perform kidney transplants.""The story of Kamrul Islam's humanitarian activities spread across the country at the tail end of last year. Since then, he has been in the limelight. Thousands of people have received complicated kidney related treatment either free of cost or at nominal cost, and are now living healthy lives. His work has also received praise in government circles. As a recognition of the ray of hope that he has shown in the private medical sector with his kidney transplants, the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs has selected him in the medicine sector as the recipient of the highest civilian award in the country – the Swadhinata Padak 2022. By Farid Uddin Rony

I am not involved with any robbery.

The officers seem to have violated laws, he said.""The woman was brutally tortured for three days in police custody.

/sports/cricket/news/mustafizur-needs-fizz-back-3137696,Mustafizur needs Fizz back,"With the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia approaching at the end of the month, Bangladesh's concerns in the pace-bowling department seem to have deepened, with a special focus on the most experienced of the lot: Mustafizur Rahman.The left-arm seamer has been missing his 'Fizz' lately, evident again in the first game of the tri-nation series against Pakistan yesterday, and that is surely a headache for the team management.The 27-year-old looked ordinary on a seaming Christchurch pitch, which behaved similarly to the pitches expected during the World Cup in Australia, and was unable to extract that extra pace and bounce, even compared to the other Bangladeshi seamers.Mustafizur simply could not live up to his reputation, going wicketless and conceding 48 runs from his four overs, both in the Power play and death overs.Although Bangladesh made a positive start with Taskin Ahmed conceding just one run off the first over after skipper Nurul Hasan Sohan opted to bowl, Mustafizur's two overs in the Powerplay cost 19 runs. More importantly, it handed the momentum to Pakistan despite the bowlers at the other end managing to keep things tight.We are disappointed. The wicket was good and the bowlers did well. We need to improve in a few areas though. Wickets in the middle while batting cost us. Liton [Das] and Yasir [Ali] batted well, but as I said, we need to improve there. Bangladesh T20I vice-captain Nurul Hasan Sohan
The left-arm pacer was wayward with his line and length from the start of the game, but Sohan had no alternative to the experience that Mustafizur offered in the death overs.



Unfortunately, the Fizz -- known for lethal cutters and yorkers as well excelling at the crucial task of keeping runs in check at the death in the early stages of his career -- was a shadow of his former self yesterday.
When Nurul handed the ball to the Fizz in the 17th over, the scenario remained unchanged. The left-arm seamer was guilty of bowling too wide or short, which allowed batters to go after him. He ended up conceding 16 runs from the over.
He also bowled the final over of the innings, giving away 13 runs, including a six and a four, as Pakistan posted a competitive 167 for five, which was ultimately enough for them to seal an easy win.

/middle-east/news/amini-died-illness-iran-3137826,Amini died of illness: Iran,"Iran yesterday said an investigation into the death in custody of Mahsa Amini found she lost her life due to illness rather than reported beatings that sparked three weeks of bloody protests.Amini, 22, died on September 16, three days after falling into a coma following her arrest in Tehran by the morality police for allegedly breaching the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.Anger over her death has sparked the biggest wave of protests to rock Iran in almost three years and a crackdown that has killed dozens of protesters and seen scores arrested.Despite the security forces' use of lethal force, the women-led protests have continued for 21 consecutive nights, according to online videos verified by AFP.Iran's Forensic Organization said that ""Mahsa Amini's death was not caused by blows to the head and vital organs and limbs of the body"".The death of Amini, whose Kurdish first name is Jhina, was related to ""surgery for a brain tumour at the age of eight,"" it said in a statement.Amini's bereaved parents have filed a complaint against the officers involved, and one of her cousins living in Iraq has told AFP she died of ""a violent blow to the head"".The United States has called for accountability for Amini's death ""after injuries sustained while in police custody"". On Thursday, Washington imposed sanctions on seven Iranian officials over a shutdown of internet access and the crackdown, reports Reuters.Other young girls have lost their lives at the protests, but Amnesty International says Iran has been forcing televised confessions out of their families to ""absolve themselves of responsibility for their deaths"".The mother of 16-year-old Nika Shahkarami, who died after going missing on September 20, insisted on Thursday she was killed by the state after joining an anti-hijab protest in Tehran.Nasrin Shahkarami also accused the authorities of threatening her to make a forced confession over the death of her daughter Nika.Iran's judiciary has since denied reports the security forces killed another teenage girl, Sarina Esmailzadeh, at a rally in Karaj, west of Tehran.Its website quoted a prosecutor as saying an investigation showed Esmailzadeh, also 16, had ""committed suicide"" by jumping from a building.In a widening crackdown, Iran has blocked access to social media, including Instagram and WhatsApp and launched a campaign of mass arrests.Protesters have sought ways to avoid detection, with schoolgirls hiding or blurring their faces while shouting ""Death to the dictator"" and defacing images of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in verified videos.Another form of protest emerged yesterday morning, with fountains in Tehran appearing to pour blood after an artist turned their waters red to reflect the deadly crackdown."
/sports/cricket/news/makeshift-openers-make-makeshift-approach-3137716,Makeshift openers make for makeshift approach,"Bangladesh's approach to T20s and everything relating to it has been so oft-repeated that one might venture to think they have brought about some seminal change to how the game is being played.Following the opening match of the tri-nation series against Pakistan, questions about 'impact' and approach would have been pondered because of the very absence of those phrases in Bangladesh's batting plan.All the big teams send out openers capable of not only taking advantage of field restrictions, but also constructing their innings in a way where they can power on towards a bigger total in case they get through to the end overs.So it becomes perplexing, especially so with the T20 World Cup around the corner, when the Tigers continue to send in two makeshift openers in the form of Mehedi Hasan Miraz and Sabbir Rahman. It also raises questions about the effectiveness of the think-tank's planning.Pakistan go in with an entirely different idea, where openers Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam both anchor the team due to a fragile middle-order and there is evidence their plan works. Both Babar and Rizwan are prolific T20I batters and the latter, having bided his time to construct innings, accelerated in the death overs as Pakistan posted 167 for five.There is nothing wrong with either Mehedi or Sabbir's approach, especially considering that Bangladesh have been unable to score runs while also losing wickets in the Powerplay. Mehedi and Sabbir both look to see off the initial exchanges and the former has found runs while the latter's return has shown that adjusting to international cricket after a long time away is difficult.The problem arises because neither is expected to carry on after a lukewarm approach in the Powerplay. Even when Babar and Rizwan start with caution, they are capable of building on that. Miraz is the definition of makeshift opener and is not the pinch-hitting kind either while Sabbir may be the pinch-hitting kind, but has not been able to make his bat talk.It is expected from most teams' tacticians to reserve the greatest number of deliveries for their more aggressive batters, who are capable of scoring big runs.Bangladesh's batting, as it turned out yesterday, was dependent on Liton Das and Afif Hossain taking the attack to Pakistan.However, in their attempt to protect an established opener such as Liton by sending him in at number three, the team management is putting pressure on the very batters that have to do the majority of the heavy lifting.Neither can Liton make an impact in the few Powerplay overs that he does get, nor do Bangladesh take adequate advantage of the first six overs in the way Liton can.When Liton and Afif were trying to accelerate yesterday, they were doing so with the knowledge that the pressure had once again been put on the Bangladesh batting lineup.The makeshift opening stand has perhaps added some solidity, but the approach in T20Is is of aggression and the Tigers' choice of openers does not reflect such a mindset.Those in charge of the team, have often made changes without accountability. Sabbir may well be put away after a short foray much like others have in the past. But without actual merit of planning and approach, no solution can be a stable one."
/satireday/news/blackout-was-planned-get-people-social-media-officials-3137771,Blackout was planned to get people off social media: Officials,"After the blackout this week, rumours have been rife on social media speculating its causes.Opposition parties have been quick to blame the authorities.Some have gone so far as to say the authorities are stealing from the grid to maintain their lavish lifestyles.But when this correspondent, who usually refuses to meet people, got down to investigate, he found something entirely different was going on.With mental health awareness at its peak -- peak because before people would straight up stigmatise anyone with mental health issues -- in the country and World Mental Health Day coming up, authorities wanted to do something different this time.Studies upon studies revealed that overuse of social media is directly proportionate with declining mental health.But according to the government's Superbly Difficult Goals-2100, by the year 2100, all people of this country should be somewhat happy with their lives.And to achieve that goal the government decided it would find ways to keep people off social media, to which end it implemented draconian laws punishing people for posts on social media that ""hurt"" others.But nothing seemed to be working. Children, adults, even infants were hooked to the machine, constantly consuming drama, constantly churning out drama.With Mental Health Day fast approaching and this year being the first that the nation became a signatory to the SDG-2100, something needed to be done.So, high authorities decided the only way to keep people off social media and bring back 90s nostalgia is to implement a long blackout -- making sure IPS' backups run out, generator fuel runs out, mobile networks glitch and people are well and truly plunged into darkness.""It really seemed to have worked. People actually had candlelight dinners, children went to the roof and people took photographs of a dark and ethereal city. What can be more beautiful?"" said one top authority, not willing to be named.He further added, that since the campaign was so successful they are thinking of more blackouts in the future."

/news/bangladesh/news/human-trafficking-conviction-only-15pc-cases-3137726,Human trafficking cases: Only 1.5pc see conviction,"Seven years ago, Mohammad Sabuj and his neighbour Mohiuddin Sarkar from Cumilla's Daudkandi paid around Tk 13 lakh to six people who lured them with well-paying jobs in Germany. In February 2015, the six traffickers sent the two to India, assuring them that getting the German visa would be easier there. But Sabuj and Sarkar got nothing and after 17 days in India, were brought back to Bangladesh, and taken to Cox's Bazar.""This time, they told us that they would send us to Thailand first and then to Germany. They asked to stay at a house until a boat comes from Thailand. But within a few days, they fled abandoning us,"" Sabuj told The Daily Star.After managing to make their way back to Daudkandi, Sabuj filed a case against six members of the trafficking gang with Paltan Police Station in the capital on July 10 that year.Police Bureau of Investigation investigated the case and submitted a charge sheet to a Dhaka court against three accused on April 20, 2016.The court framed charges against them on January 22, 2017. But none of the 13 witnesses, named in the charge sheet, testified in the case during the trial that continued for around five years.On July 27 this year, the Anti-Human Trafficking Offence Tribunal of Dhaka  acquitted the accused.In the verdict, the judge said, ""There are no legal or rational provisions for a criminal case to be pending for years due to a failure of the state in producing witnesses.""Instead of justice for his ordeal, Sabuj got nothing but frustration. ""I did not get my money back, nor did the accused get punishment. I did not get justice.""This is not an isolated case of trafficking accused escaping justice. The conviction rate in human trafficking cases in Bangladesh is dismally low.Anti-Human Trafficking Offence Tribunal of Dhaka, which started operation in March 2020, only deals with cases filed in different police stations in Dhaka Division.Analysing its data, The Daily Star found that only around 1.5 percent of human trafficking cases it dealt with resulted in convictions.According to the data, around 858 cases were disposed of from March 2020 to August this year and only 13 ended in convictions with 20 accused handed different jail terms.In 2020, 37 cases were disposed of in the tribunal, and 22 were settled before the cases went to trial. In 2021, 475 cases were disposed, of which 76 were settled before they reached the trial stage. Till August this year, 346 cases were disposed of by the tribunal in Dhaka, with 36 being settled before trial.Bangladesh enacted the Prevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking Act-2012 to combat trafficking and protect victims. But it took the government nearly eight years to set up special tribunals -- as mandated by the law -- to exclusively deal with trafficking cases.In 2020, the government also set up these special tribunals in Chattogram, Barishal, Rangpur, Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi for ensuring speedy trials in human trafficking cases.However, some 5,781 cases involving 29,181 accused were still pending in all seven courts as of June, according to the home ministry's database.WHY SUCH A LOW CONVICTION RATE?Experts and rights activists blamed the low conviction rate on the absence of proper evidence in the charge sheet, non-appearance of witnesses, out-of-court settlements, the accused reaching a compromise with victims, and lack of expertise in dealing with the cases.KM Sazzadul Hoque Shihab, a state lawyer of the tribunal in Dhaka, said although courts send summons to respective police stations, the law enforcers fail to produce witnesses.""This non-appearance of witnesses is the major reason behind low convictions,"" he told The Daily Star.Another major reason for low convictions is out-of-court settlements, he said. The victims often give in to the pressure exerted by the accused.Shariful Hasan, head of Brac's Migration Program, said the absence of proper evidence and information in charge sheets resulted in low conviction rates.""Political will is necessary for trafficking case convictions. At present, police do not treat trafficking cases as their major focus,"" said Shariful.Md Nazrul Islam, special superintendent (human trafficking wing) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), however, said there is no scope for neglecting any case.""Sometimes it becomes difficult to prove every case beyond reasonable doubt as we cannot spend a long time on a single case. In many cases, victims do not cooperate, and so we become involved with another case.""He, however, said the compromise of the victim or the victim's family with the accused is one of the major reasons for the low conviction rate. Sometimes, the accused threaten victims and witnesses and tell them not to appear in court, while at other times victims stop the proceedings after getting back some of the money they paid to traffickers, Nazrul added.WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONESources in the law enforcement agencies said a major loophole found in the charge sheets was that the police often fail to provide clear information about the place of occurrences as they took place in foreign countries.But SS Nazrul said that they are working to overcome the problem.""We are now taking support and information from different international NGOs like IOM and collecting data from them. We also seek assistance from Interpol,"" he said.Nazrul, however, said victims need to come to the police and speak out about problems and stop making negotiations with the accused.""We are now trying to create awareness in this regard. Even, we have a small team from the serious crime unit of CID at the airport to give support to trafficking victims,"" he added.Shariful Hasan thinks that the public prosecutors have a major role to play.""Victims often told us that the prosecutors did not inform properly about the case hearing or when the witness needed to be produced,"" he said, suggesting continuous training for all stakeholders involved with the trafficking case.Besides, special attention needs to be given at those places where a huge number of trafficking cases are registered like Dhaka, Cox's Bazar, Satkhira and Jhenidah. "

/news/bangladesh/transport/news/bhanga-benapole-highway-smoother-link-not-so-soon-3137711,Bhanga-Benapole highway: Smoother link not so soon,"Despite the opening of the Padma Bridge and the Madhumati Bridge, the country will not be able to reap the maximum benefit of the enhanced connectivity as the 129km road from Faridpur's Bhanga to Jashore's Benapole is still not ready for increased vehicular movement.A plan for turning the two-lane Bhanga-Benapole road into a four-lane highway was chalked out long ago but it saw little progress, thanks mainly to uncertainty over funding, officials said.Roads and Highways Department (RHD) has prepared two separate development project proposals (DPPs) -- one for acquiring land and relocating utility lines while another for physical works -- involving Tk 15,286 crore (BDT 89 per $1) to expand the road.But it is not possible to say when the projects will be approved and when the work will start as both the proposals have to go through a lengthy process to get the final nod.Even if the projects are approved this year, the land acquisition will take till June 2025 while the main project till 2027, as per the related documents.In this situation, smooth road communication for the people of the southwestern region and vibrant cross-border connectivity is still a distant dream.""We are not in the habit of doing anything with a comprehensive plan. We don't have the capacity either. This has been exposed here again,"" transport expert Prof Moazzem Hossain said.WHY THIS ROAD IS IMPORTANT?Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in June inaugurated the long-cherished Padma Bridge, creating a direct link between the capital and the southwestern region.The longest bridge in the country has cut the travel time significantly between the capital and the southwest. It is also a key component of the Asian Highway-1, which is expected to boost the economic growth of Asia and improve the country's standing in the continent.The AH-1, connecting Meghalaya with West Bengal of India via Tamabil-Sylhet-Dhaka-Narail-Jashore, had two missing links: one is the Padma Bridge and another Kalna bridge, formally named Modhumoti Bridge, in Narail.The prime minister will inaugurate the Modhumoti Bridge on Monday, meaning there will be no missing link left.The government has already taken two projects to turn the two-lane highways from Dhaka to Sylhet and Sylhet to Tamabil into four-lane ones.The expansion of the Dhaka-Sylhet highway will start this year and Sylhet-Tamabil highway early next year. On the other hand, the government has already turned the road from Dhaka to Bhanga into an expressway.But the road from Bhanga to Benapole via Jashore is a two-lane highway, with a ferry terminal at Kalna point of Madhumati river in Narail.So, most of the vehicles bound for Benapole, Jashore, Jhenaidah -- even many heading to Satkhira -- take Bhanga-Faridpur-Magura road avoiding the ferry route while some vehicles use the ferry service.With the opening of the Madhumati Bridge at the Kalna point, which will establish a direct road link between Bhanga and Benapole, there will be a major shift in the movement of vehicles, including those for cross-border trade.And most of the vehicles will use Bhanga-Narail-Jashore-Benapole road, experts and RHD officials said.According to an RHD official, the distance from Dhaka to Jashore via Gabtoli-Paturia-Daulatdia-Magura-Jashore is 218km. It will be only 160km via Jatrabari-Padma Bridge-Madhumati Bridge.Prof Moazzem said the feasibility study carried out for the Padma Bridge in 2003-2005 gave a clear picture of the possible changes in the road sector after the opening of the Padma Bridge.""So, the authorities should have made plans considering all these things,"" he said.The Madhumati Bridge would be the first six-lane bridge in the country.""Can you imagine how weird it is if a six-lane bridge is connected with the two-lane road on both sides? The authorities should have opened a four-lane road along with the bridge,"" he told this correspondent on Thursday.""But nothing happens here in a planned way. Besides, we have a fund crisis too,"" he added.He, however, said if the two-lane road can be kept operational properly, it can deal with the growing traffic for two-three years at best.""But if the road can't be expanded within two-three years, there will be a major problem,"" he said.WHY DELAY?Bangladesh in October 2017 signed a $4.5 billion line of credit agreement with India, which is the third LoC deal between the two countries.The Bhanga-Jashore-Benapole road expansion is among the projects that will be financed from the third LoC, RHD officials said.RHD in July 2019 submitted a DPP to the Road Transport and Highways Division for acquiring land and moving the utility services lines as part of preparations for starting the physical work.But the Planning Commission asked RHD to recast the DPP and when RHD, re-submitted it to the division again after necessary changes, the division in February this year once again asked for its recast.RHD recently resubmitted the DPP, as per which the cost for acquiring land and moving the utility services lines would be Tk 4,236.60 crore. The full amount will come from the government fund.On the other hand, RHD in December 2020 placed a DPP for the main project. But the division in June 2021 asked RHD to recast it.When the DPP was resubmitted, the division, holding a meeting around two months ago, asked RHD to recast it again and ensure funding for the project before moving forward with it, official sources said.The project cost would be Tk 11,050.04 crore, of which Tk 8,724.59 crore was supposed to come from the project aid.Meanwhile, RHD, under a project funded by Asian Development Bank, completed a feasibility study and detailed design of the project in December 2021, the sources said.""We are ready to move ahead with the project but we did not get a clear commitment regarding loan from India,"" an RHD official said, wishing not to be named.Contacted, RHD Chief Engineer AKM Manir Hossain Pathan said the project is supposed to be implemented with the LoC fund.""But there are some loan-related problems here,"" he told The Daily Star on Thursday when asked about the reason behind the delay.He, however, did not go into further details.An RHD official said the division has asked them to expedite the resubmission of the main DPP as the Madhumati Bridge will be opened on Monday, and the RHD is preparing to do it shortly. "
/weekend-read/news/wests-meddling-iran-3137871,West’s meddling in Iran,"Tobacco Protest (1891)On 20 March 1890, the long-standing Iranian Qajar monarch Nasir al-Din Shah granted a concession to British Major GF Talbot for a full monopoly over the production, sale, and export of tobacco for 50 years. At the time, the Persian tobacco industry employed over 200,000 people, so the concession represented a major blow to Persian farmers and traders. The boycotts and protests against it were widespread and extensive as a result of cleric Mirza Hasan Shirazi's fatwa (judicial decree).Persian Constitutional Revolution (1905–1911)The growing dissatisfaction continued until the Constitutional Revolution of 1905–1911. The revolution led to the establishment of a parliament, and approval of the first constitution. Although the revolution was successful in weakening the autocracy of the Qajar regime, it failed to provide a powerful alternative government. Therefore, in the decades following the establishment of the new parliament, a number of critical events took place. The Shahs of Persia were backed by foreign powers against the parliament.Reza Shah (1921–1935)Insecurity and chaos created after the Constitutional Revolution led to the rise of General Reza Khan, the commander of the elite Persian Cossack Brigade who seized power, with the help of UK, in a coup d'état in February 1921. He established a constitutional monarchy, deposing the last Qajar Shah, Ahmed Shah, in 1925 and being designated monarch by the National Assembly, to be known thenceforth as Reza Shah, founder of the Pahlavi dynasty.Iranian coup d'état (1953)In 1941, an invasion of allied British and Soviet troops deposed Reza Shah, who was considered friendly to Nazi Germany, and installed his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as Shah. From 1901 on, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, owned by Britain, enjoyed a monopoly on sale and production of Iranian oil. It was the most profitable British business in the world. In 1953, following the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry by the democratically elected prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh, American and British forces instituted a highly effective embargo of Iranian oil, and covertly destabilized the legislature and helped return control to their ally, Pahlavi. The American ""Operation Ajax"", orchestrated by the CIA, was aided by the British MI6 in organizing a military coup d'état to oust Mossadegh on August 19."

/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/17-year-old-gang-raped-kamalapur-station-5-arrested-3138066,17-year-old gang-raped at Kamalapur station; 5 arrested,"Police have arrested five people on charges of raping a 17-year-old girl in a bogie of a train in the capital's Kamalapur Railway Station.Confirming the incident, Ferdous Ahmed Biswas, officer-in-charge (OC) of Dhaka Railway Police Station (Kamalapur), said the victim filed a rape case against six people early today (October 8, 2022).Five people have been arrested so far in this connection. They are Sumon (21), Nayeem (25), Nazmul (25), Anwar (20), and Roman Prakash Kalu (22).Another accused named Imran (20) is absconding. Efforts are on to arrest him, the OC said.Quoting the case statement, Sub-Inspector (SI) Riaz Mahmud of the same police station, said that the girlis from Bahatra upazila of Netrakona. After an argument with her family, she left home and went to Kamalapur station last night travelling on Haor Express train.As she was unsure of where to go, she sat on the platform where Imran, who sells water at the station, advised the girl to sleep on a bogie of Turag Community Local Train.Also,Imran asked her to mention his name in case of emergency.Imran and his five accomplices later gang-raped her inside the compartment around 1am.When the group noticed a member of the Railway Security was passing by, they ran away in fear.The security officer noticed the girl lying inside the bogie and informed the police, rescued the girllater.He added that the five were arrested from the station area after the girl identified them."
/sports/cricket/news/babar-steers-pakistan-win-over-new-zealand-3138086,Babar steers Pakistan to win over New Zealand,"Captain Babar Azam's half-century inspired Pakistan to their second win in the Twenty20 international tri-series in Christchurch on Saturday, coasting past New Zealand by six wickets.Azam rode his luck in reaching 79 off 53 balls as his team took command of the series following their opening 21-run win over Bangladesh on Friday.All three sides are using the week-long tournament at Hagley Oval to prepare for the T20 World Cup in Australia.New Zealand's 147-8 after winning the toss looked inadequate and Azam's knock took away any prospect of victory, steering the tourists to 149-4 with 10 balls to spare.The hosts paid a heavy price for a straightforward dropped catch by Glenn Phillips at point off Tim Southee's bowling when Azam was on 27.The opener went on to post his 28th T20 international half-century, the equal second most alongside Rohit Sharma, with both sitting behind another Indian, Virat Kohli (33).Southee snared the early wicket of Mohammad Rizwan -- who scored a match-winning unbeaten 78 against Bangladesh -- and the Pakistan middle order largely struggled aside from Shadab Khan's 34 off 22 balls.However, Azam's presence meant his team were always in control.The result was virtually sealed when he and Haider Ali took 21 runs off the final over of Blair Tickner (2-42), the third-last of the innings.Azam said the rapid 61-run stand with Shadab for the third wicket gave an insight to a tactic they could employ at the World Cup, with the allrounder shifted up the order.""Definitely, we have a plan to send Shadab up to charge the bowlers, to utilise his skills,"" Azam said.""He played very well. We planned that I would go all the way and Shadab would take a chance.""Earlier, it took late blows from middle-order batsman Mark Chapman to revive a muddled New Zealand effort with the bat.Chapman's 32 off 16 balls followed solid innings from opener Devon Conway (36 off 35) and captain Kane Williamson (31 off 30), although both struggled for timing during a 61-run stand for the second wicket.It was another frustrating outcome for the accomplished Williamson, who has passed 50 on just two occasions in all formats over the last 18 months, a period that has encompassed 29 innings.He was clean-bowled attempting a slog-sweep off spinner Mohammad Nawaz, while Chapman holed out to a slower ball from Pakistan's best bowler, paceman Haris Rauf (3-28).New Zealand face Bangladesh in the third match of the series on Sunday."
/life-living/food-recipes/news/the-love-coffee-how-i-find-home-cup-coffee-wherever-i-go-3138091,For the love of coffee: How I find home in a cup of coffee wherever I go,"Saudade is Portuguese. In his 1912 book In Portugal, Portuguese scholar Aubrey Bell describes saudade as ""a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist, for something other than the present."" When I imagine the concept of a singular home, I feel a strong sense of saudade. I envy those who have one place that they call home, a concrete place that ties them to a sense of identity and belonging.My saudade-home is anchored in the memories of my teenager-into-early-twenties life in Dhaka. Spending my free time sitting with a hot cup of coffee in North End on winter nights, having hour-long addas with friends, playing cards and ludo, or sharing stories with cousins in our drawing room in Old Dhaka.Stolen moments, romantic rickshaw rides, a brief date in a North End café. I long for the warmth these memories hold, and know, in my present, that I cannot find that warmth, abroad, so far away from all my loved ones.On cold winter days in Germany, when all I crave is the warmth of my mother's hug, I seek out comfort in the piece of home I carry with me to all the foreign lands I have ever lived in - cosiness in a cup of North End coffee. Chattogram beans to be exact, a product that is Bangladeshi through and through — farmed, roasted and packed with love for me by North End coffee roasters. As Bengalis, our entire lives begin and end with a cup of milk tea. We sit in circles, and weave stories and share memories — our ""addas"" are like no other. Friend circles, relationships and lives are all hemmed in addas. And for my generation, and perhaps every subsequent generation from a similar background, the 'dudh cha' is segueing into coffee. For me the Portuguese saudade is soothed by the Danish word ""hygge."" Hygge captures the feeling of cosiness in winter achieved by family time and warm drinks.Smells, tastes and textures can be powerful memory triggers, instantly transporting us to certain times in our lives and the emotions that we felt. When saudade resurfaces and all I want is to recreate those memories, through the smell of the fragrant beans, the smooth and earthy taste of coffee with frothy milk.I recreate my own hygge, grinding the fragrant North End beans and brewing up a piping hot almond milk cappuccino that will soothe my soul on a dark, cold, Berlin winter day. Every sip of this drink is a reminder that I can, in some ways, be in two places at once, by bringing a taste of home with me, wherever I go in the world. With a cup of coffee in hand, I sit across screens and call my cousins in Bangladesh and recreate those addas sharing cups of coffee. Facetiming with various beautiful backdrops across the world, I share my travel stories with them and remember that sense of home we shared half a lifetime ago.We reminisce about songs from Stoic Bliss or Fuad and Mila. We laugh at the funny outfits we would wear in the name of fashion and re-tell stories from the many addas in cafés before or after shopping. Some would say it's only a cup of coffee, but it is not. It's a memory, a story, a thread of stability and a sense of hygge that has connected me to my homeland through taste and smell for almost half my life.When the world feels foreign, cold and distant, and I feel saudade piercing my soul, the power of this single cup of coffee is insurmountable in its ability to lift me and place me in familiarity and warmth."

Has some serious power, so it boosts our middle order, and to come out and play like that and with his height as well, and strength, it suits us, that's for sure.""On a tacky wicket from which most batsmen struggled to break loose, David clobbered three sixes and four fours, injecting fresh life into Australia's stuttering batting performance.""Now where does he fit in the line-up as well and what's his role?"" said Warner who topscored with a belligerent 75.""I think coming out and playing that role there perfectly, when it was a hard wicket to start on, really opens our eyes to 'OK, now how do we utilise that?'""You don't get these types of players every day. So it's going to be good for us moving forward and hopefully there's a spot there as well, because the selectors have got a headache now, I think.""

Foreign designers and products glow under the limelight every wedding season just to create a veil of perfect weddings. With the notion that local wedding wear is not up to the mark, most of us shy away from shopping locally for weddings. However, is it necessary to go out of our way to get all the wedding-related essentials from abroad despite having thriving homegrown brands with years of skills to offer?To answer the question above, the first-ever edition of Bangladesh Wedding Couture Week 2022 (BWCW) gathers all cogs and wheels of the wedding industry under the same roof to highlight multiple local brands of products and services and essential roles in the season.BWCW aims to shift consumers' focus back to vendors and manufacturers working in the wedding market to make them thrive and innovate further in their crafts.The three designer brands, Sarah Karim Couture, Zurhem, and Sahar Rahman Couture, showcasing their wedding collections, bring an intricate line of wedding wear, including bridal and bridesmaids' outfits, grooms' attire, and accessories. The suave ensembles bring quality fabric and elegant patterns right next door to you. Not only is their work on par with foreign brands, their high-end quality and the ingenious visions of designers bring locally made branded attire and accessories to the centre stage.This wedding season, BWCW, presented by TRESemmé and driven by Mercedes-Benz, brings brides and grooms-to-be an array of sophisticated and elegant bridal wear. The three creative minds on the ramp featured wedding attires focusing on holud and mehendi events on 6 October 2022.Associated with Mohammad & Sons, Jarwa House, and Judith Leiber Couture, the gala event was filled with poised, chic and elegant guests waiting to get wide-eyed by what the three designers had to offer for this wedding season.Enrico Nunziata, Italian Ambassador to Bangladesh, graced the event with his presence among the A-list guests. Co-sponsored by Rupayan City, Penthouse Living, F45 Banani, Ananta Terraces, Berger, Este, City Bank, and Kawsar Chowdhury, the 3-day fashion event exhibits outfits unique to wedding events like holud, mehendi night, and the reception.Traditionally, the holud is one of the most anticipated and activity-filled wedding events. As the way has it, the colour yellow has been the go-to colour theme for ages. With time, the event has received a modern twist. Vibrant and pastel colours now have the space to shine. BWCW featured a multitude of colour shades and pastel tones meant for the holud, while keeping its traditional traits intact.Starting with Jarwa House, the jewellery brand launched the show with a stellar showcase by bringing gold back to the top of the trending charts. With both traditional and modern designs, the exquisite jewellery line reflects four generations of designing, including earrings, necklaces, and headpieces in minimalism and heavy designs incorporating jade, rubies, and pearls.Next came the first designer clothing brand, Sarah Karim Couture, highlighting the Holud Collection with bright and pastel colours with hints of yellow, lime green, and fuchsia pink. The bridal wear in this line also caters to the bride's mobility with light fabric like net and muslin accentuating 'gota patti' designs and mirror work, which is popular this season.Sahar Rahman Couture's line-up appearing third on the runway also highlighted women's bridal wear staying true to the brand's love of bright colours while keeping it soothing to the eye. With two pieces and traditional dresses, the colourful multi-colour outfits combine vibrant and pastel tones of red, orange, pink, green, and blue harmoniously. The traditionally trendy collection blends traditional designs with a modern and graceful flare.Underling the other major part of the wedding, Zurhem's modern and avant-garde take on the groom's attire collection captivated everyone's eyes. With Mehruz Munir as Managing Director, the luxury menswear brand displayed its wedding collection for men with outfits elegantly designed with multiple colours and floral embroidery. From kurtas, sherwanis, coats and ethnic vests in pastel and vibrant shades of yellow, white, green, and pink, Zurhem gave a contemporary twist on the idea of what a groom can rock on his holud night.Azra Mahmood directed BWCW's first fashion show. The vibrant night was also made possible through the event partners, Shahjahan Wedding Planner & Event Management for event decor, Privé by Nahila Hedayet and La'belle Beauty Salon for the makeover, and K.Nasif Photography and Snapshot for photography, to name a few."

""There is no justification for using taxpayers' money to exacerbate the climate crisis.""One of the main ways the Bank continued to fund fossil fuels was by exploiting a ""major loophole"" by lending to intermediaries such as banks or financial institutions and by acting as a guarantor in case a country did not meet its obligations, the report said.In a statement to AFP, the World Bank said, ""We dispute the findings of the report: it makes inaccurate assumptions about the World Bank Group's lending.A separate report published by Oxfam earlier this week said the World Bank ""supplies very little evidence to support its claims about the amount of climate finance it provides,"" leaving the public to take their figures ""on faith."""

They (Arsenal) are in a fantastic moment but if you look at our results in the Premier League I think no one would give us a chance there,"" said defender Van Dijk.""But we know what we are capable of, we know what is expected. They are in the best moment of their lives, full of confidence, and it's a big game.""LASAGNE FUELS HAALAND'S HOT STREAKAs defenders across Europe struggle to sate Erling Haaland's appetite for goals, the Manchester City striker has revealed his recipe for success.Haaland is in such prolific form that he was only needed for the first half of City's 5-0 rout of Copenhagen in the Champions League on Wednesday, during which he netted twice.The 22-year-old has scored 19 goals in 11 competitive games in a remarkable first season with City following his £51 million ($57 million) move from Borussia Dortmund.And the Norway star says his dad Alfie's home-cooked lasagne has played a key role in his blistering run.""I've had it before every home game now and that turns out fairly well, so there has to be something special he adds to it,""  said Haaland.""I help out very little. I mostly lie on the couch watching him. That's the way it works.""With Haaland adding the attacking fulcrum City had lacked since Sergio Aguero's departure, the champions have embarked on a power surge featuring 29 goals in their first eight league games.No wonder City boss Pep Guardiola was quick to deny reports in Spain this week that Haaland's City contract contains a clause that allows Real Madrid to sign him from 2024.TEN HAG WRESTLES WITH CASEMIRO DILEMMAErik ten Hag could finally give Brazil midfielder Casemiro his first Premier League start as the Manchester United manager tries to steady his side after their ""reality check"" at Manchester City.United's four-match winning league run came to a painful end when City hammered them 6-3 last weekend.Ten Hag believes that chastening defeat should serve to refocus his players for Sunday's trip to Everton, but he has a significant selection dilemma to solve first.Since signing Casemiro from Real Madrid for an initial £60 million in August, Ten Hag has used the five-time Champions League winner sparingly due to Scott McTominay's solid performances.Casemiro has made four substitute appearances in the Premier League, with his only starts coming in the Europa League, but the derby meltdown could be the trigger for a sustained promotion to the starting line-up.""I said already before, it had nothing to do with Casemiro, it was all to do with Scott,"" said Ten Hag. ""I'm sure Casemiro will play a really important role."""

That is annoying me. Gundo is not going to play one more minute for the rest of the season,"" he said with a laugh.""I'm going to invite her and Gundo as well to go to Tast.

/business/economy/opinion/news/helping-families-cope-price-shocks-without-subsidies-3138021,Helping families cope with price shocks—without subsidies,"Amid ongoing food and fuel crises worldwide, general subsidies are making a big comeback as a way of delivering social protection to the population. In fact, according to a World Bank tracker, the number of social protection measures introduced in response to rising inflation almost tripled globally between April and September 2022. More than a third of these were subsidies, including for fuel, food, fertilizers, and fees (such as for electricity, water and heating services).The questions arise as to why subsidies are such a popular response, and why are they so difficult to reform. This puzzle lies at the centre of the discussions that will take place during the upcoming IMF-World Bank Group Annual Meetings (October 10-16). Ahead of these meetings, we offer some key points for consideration.It has been widely observed that subsidies tend to be politically popular for several reasons.First, most people benefit from subsidies, and thus, they may enjoy broader political support than programmes that benefit only a subset of the population.Second is transparency; for example, with an energy subsidy, consumers see the subsidised price on their energy bills.Third, since they are widespread and long-established, subsidies can be an appealing vehicle for responding to crises that affect most people and different sectors.Finally, governments can claim that they influence what people consume. For example, subsidising milk or eggs to ensure children get enough protein, rather than offering a cash subsidy that people may waste on so-called ""temptation goods"" such as alcohol or tobacco.However, subsidies are undesirable for a number of reasons. First and foremost, they are regressive—that is, they benefit richer families more than poorer families, and they are highly expensive. In addition, specific subsidies can have negative consequences. Fuel subsidies, for example, have serious environmental effects.Subsidising particular foods, such as bread, can backfire in terms of achieving balanced nutrition. It is far better to shift to transfers, and they should be in-cash not in-kind. And the idea that recipients waste cash on so-called temptation goods is not well supported by evidence, undermining much of the rationale for trying to influence spending.For these reasons, prior to the current global crises, many countries had been trying to move away from subsidies toward targeted cash transfers of various types. This trend should be accelerated.Why? First, cash transfers can be targeted to the households in various ways. Second, evidence shows cash transfers do not discourage work, often a key concern when it comes to those programmes. Finally, cash transfers generate local economic multipliers.With recent technological changes and improvements in social protection delivery systems, governments have more practical options for reaching people in need and can rely less on subsidies. While challenges exist, by applying various targeting methods countries can focus cash transfers on their most vulnerable population, or those who suffered the most as a result of the shock—or target more broadly.Having social protection systems in place that reach the most vulnerable is a great place to start the scale-up toward universality. This can also help in crisis: Leveraging existing systems is often by far the simplest and fastest social protection response in an emergency. But social assistance is only part of the story: Governments may also expand social insurance programmes to help households during shocks. Active labour market programmes like targeted wage subsidies can also help with the heavy lifting.At the same time crises can spark innovation. Often relatively broad, flat (or minorly customised) benefit designs can be used for crisis response programmes. This simplifies eligibility decisions and balances protecting poor people, helping a broader group of households cope with shocks, and other policy goals. There were many such innovations during Covid as countries sought to support people previously unreached by social protection. While there is no perfect system, there is enough evidence that social protection programmes can and do work, and it is time to use them to their full potential.Mamta Murthi is vice-president for human development at the World Bank, Michal Rutkowski is global director for social protection and jobs; and Ugo Gentilini is global lead for social assistance."

While on a six-game winning streak in LaLiga with striker Robert Lewandowski on a roll, they have lost two consecutive Champions League games and will host Celta knowing that they face a crucial encounter against Inter Milan three days later at Camp Nou.A third loss in four games would leave Barca in danger of being knocked out of the Champions League at the group stage for the second consecutive season.Coach Xavi will again have a major selection headache with several key players nursing injuries.Frenkie de Jong, Memphis Depay and Hector Bellerin are all doubtful and Barca have a big problem in defence with Ronald Araujo, Jules Kounde and Andreas Christensen all out injured.Attention will also be focused on the Sanchez Pizjuan stadium as Sevilla host Athletic Bilbao in new manager Jorge Sampaoli's debut, after he was appointed on Thursday following the sacking of Julen Lopetegui.It will be Sampaoli's second stint with the record six-times Europa League winners, who have suffered a poor start to the season, having won only one match in all competitions.They are 17th in LaLiga on five points, a place and a point above the relegation zone after their worst start to a league season since being promoted back to the top-flight in 2001.Led by former Barca manager Ernesto Valverde, Athletic are third in standings on 16 points, three behind leaders Barcelona and Real Madrid, having won five of their seven league games.The last time Athletic were in the top three in LaLiga was 30 years ago, when former Real Madrid and Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes was the team's manager.

/sports/tennis/news/tt-duos-treatment-raises-questions-3137681,TT duo’s treatment raises questions,"The incident of a Bangladesh Table Tennis team handing a walkover to their opponents happened not so long ago -- in 2014 during the World Team Table Tennis Championships in Japan. In that event, Rahima Khatun, Akhi Akter and Sharmin of the women's team were fortunate not to face any punishment from the Bangladesh Table Tennis Federation (BTTF).Eight years later, as the incident repeated in the Birmingham Commonwealth Games earlier in August, the BTTF took hard measures on two players – Sonam Sultana Soma and Sadia Rahman Mou – by banning them two and one year, respectively, from the international and domestic competitions.However, by allowing the suspended duo to play the two upcoming domestic competitions – Premier Division Table Tennis League and National Table Tennis Championship - only raised questions regarding the intention of the BTTF officials.BTTF's executive committee had enough time to serve show-cause notice before taking the initial decision. However, most members of the executive meeting agreed to punish Soma and Mou on basis of the team's manager report, without discussing the merit or demerit of the offence.After a couple of executive members argued the need for self-explanations from Soma and Mou, show-cause letters were issued to both players later. Turned out, there was wrong information in the letter, which wrongly mentions the match had taken place on August 4, whereas it took place a day later.Meanwhile, the players had claimed that one of the players was injured, resulting in them skipping the match following verbal communication with the BTTF general secretary Jahangir Alam, who however denied giving them any permission. The executive committee ultimately reduced the margin of punishment after the duo sought exemption.The Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA), guardian of the country's sports, has also formed a committee on September 19 to investigate what happened in Birmingham. It was also learned from a BOA official that the BTTF officials also tried to pursue the chef de mission to declare both players as 'missing ones and to be reported to the police station,' especially after the duo players failed to pick up phone calls during their visit to their relatives' house.The investigation committee is yet to consider the players' narratives, even though the written reports from the BTTF officials were taken as the committee was asked to submit their report within 15 working days after formation.Former player and five-time national champion Manosh Chowdhury demanded a neutral investigation, and added that no player has dared to give away a walkover until officials instruct them.""I think the punishment was given intentionally. If any players say anything against top three to four federation officials, they must face punishment,"" said Manosh, claiming that the federation officials tried to take actions against him once but he had countered on legal terms."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/dilbar-light-the-sky-nora-fatehis-rise-conservative-moroccan-family-3138061,From ‘Dilbar’ to ‘Light the Sky': Nora Fatehi’s rise from a conservative Moroccan family,"From ""Saki Saki"" to ""Dilbar"", the Moroccan beauty Nora Fatehi, ruled Bollywood with her scintillating dance moves and her enchanting performances. The ""queen of belly dancing"" became an international sensation with her twirls and whirls. However, her transformation to become a dancer wasn't an easy one; she had to pass significant obstacles to become one of the best dancers in Bollywood. Growing up, Nora was mocked and bullied for her dance moves. Her classmates would burst into laughter and mockery, after seeing her performance. This would break her heart, as the young girl would cry to her mother, to take her to dance lessons. However, her conservative Moroccan family wouldn't give her permission. The little girl was adamant that she would learn to dance, and thus, she started watching Youtube dance tutorials. In the end, persistence and perseverance win, and Nora Fatehi stormed into Bollywood as the reigning queen of 'item songs' in movies. Recently, the Bollywood diva has made headlines for her performance in the FIFA World cup music video. The actress is seen singing and dancing in Hindi and English in the ""Light the Sky"" music video with renowned musicians like Balqees, Rahma Riad, Manal & RedOne. Earlier, popular singers like Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, and Pitbull performed on the FIFA world cup stage. Nora is the first actress to represent South East Asia, India in particular, at the prestigious event in Qatar.Nora Fatehi was born and brought up in Canada. The young actress idolised Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan – and watched Arabic dubs of Bollywood films. She won many trophies at dance competitions in her college. When she had finished college, she received a phone call from a renowned dance institution to join their classes in the USA. However, her parents didn't grant her permission to go to school.Nora's father died after some time, and the entire responsibility of her family fell on the shoulder of the tender 18-year-old girl. The ""Kusu Kusu"" dancer started to work and send her dancing videos simultaneously across modeling agencies in India. After a year and a half, Nora got a call from an agency in Mumbai. Nora immediately packed her bags and sat on the plane to come to Mumbai in 2012.For the next two years, Nora worked in the Mumbai industry in a sporadic capacity. However, it took her five years to prove herself to her critics. The artiste was not proficient in Hindi at the beginning of her career, but now she has mastered the language very well. Apart from the Hindi film industry, she is also very popular in the South.The artiste, besides starring in music videos, has also become popular through her presence in reality shows ""Bigg Boss"", ""Jhalak Dikhla Ja"", ""Comedy Night"" and ""MTV Troll Police"".Nora's popularity has surpassed many B-town actresses. Some of her item songs include- ""Baahubali: The Beginning"", ""Kick 2"", ""Sher"", among others. The ""Dilbar"" actress doesn't want to stereotype herself in item songs only. She wants to prove her acting prowess through some quality movies. Nora is the first and only Moroccan star to have more than 2.2 million subscribers on her YouTube channel, where she creates comic skits only. "
/star-literature/news/transgenerational-quest-identity-tahmima-anams-bengal-trilogy-3137756,A Transgenerational Quest for Identity in Tahmima Anam’s Bengal Trilogy,"Tahmima Anam, the Bangladesh-born British writer, is known at home and abroad for her spontaneous and vivid writing style. She is widely distinguished as a novelist and columnist with a profound awareness of her native and international culture. Although Anam herself said that she has a complicated relationship with her roots, it is Bangladesh that she seeks to explore in most of her fictional works. Some common themes in Tahmima Anam's writing are the complexities of family relationships, the history of 1971 liberation war of Bangladesh, generational trauma associated with the neoliberal and cultural transitions, cultural assimilation followed by diasporic experiences and the like.Anam is best known for her Bengal trilogy - the sequels of familial stories in the three novels - A Golden Age (2007), The Good Muslim (2011) and The Bones of Grace (2016). In her trilogy, Anam upholds the issues of family history with a special concentration on the transgenerational quest for identity. The trilogy tells the story of three generations of women during and after the 1971 liberation war of Bangladesh. The state of shared emotional space of the generations can be termed as what transgenerational trauma theorists Tihamer Bako and Katalin Zana call as ""transgenerational atmosphere,"" the unconscious way of preserving and transmitting the familial memories when there is no available narrative to process the traumatic event. Here, the collective trauma of the liberation war is passed down from one generation to another and affects the family members on individual level as well.But she recognizes the wound in his history, the irreparable wound because she has one too. His wound is her wound. Knowing this, she finds she can no longer wish him different. Tahmima Anam , The Good Muslim
Anam's first novel A Golden Age, is about a female freedom fighter Rehana Haque's ""herstory"" within the context of the liberation war of Bangladesh. The novel is partly autobiographical because it is inspired by Anam's grandmother. In the novel, Rehana is the first generation of the Haque family to actively witness the atrocities of the war. Rehana is portrayed as a concerned single mother who tries to prevent her children Maya and Sohail from joining the war, but soon she is bound to let them go for the national call of duty. Rehana's transformation from merely a caring, protective mother to an active participant in the war surprises the readers. Rehana is grateful that her next generation is alive, ""This war that has taken so many sons has spared mine. This age that has burned so many daughters has not burned mine."" Rehana attempts to negotiate her dual roles as a loving mother and a freedom fighter, exhibiting the fluidity of her identity that also inspires her next generations. 



The second novel The Good Muslim portrays the second generation - the two siblings Maya and Sohail who attempt to accommodate themselves in the post-liberation war interregnum. Maya, like her mother Rehana, works as a volunteer at the refugee camp with the ""birangonas"" (the raped women in the war). She returns to her home in Dhaka only to find her brother Sohail as a completely transformed person - a religious fanatic. While Sohail and Maya respectively represent religious fundamentalism and liberalism, they struggle to make their moral choices in the aftermath of the war. The central conflict in the novel is that different ideological positions bring discontentment and hostility in brother-sister relationships. The siblings' identity crisis carries the ""crypt"" (the hibernating part of the inner self) of their parent Rehana as their life-worlds merge with each other. In other words, the siblings' life-choices bear the testimony of their parents' decisions.
 








The third novel Bones of Grace is about the third-generation story of Maya's daughter Zubaida Haque. It is an example of transgenerational search for motherline as well. Zubaida is torn between her root and route - she can neither break free, nor fully accept her grandparents' history. Although she has not seen any war from her firsthand experience, she sets for digging her familial past because she still must ""cobble together an identity."" Zubaida as the third- generation woman holds the proof that even though she is a present-time modern woman with a diasporic identity, the past of her ancestors is still present in her life in many forms. 
Tahmima Anam's trilogy explore how transgenerational history shapes the identity of an individual but ultimately it is the choices they make that matter. She explores the fact that in order to put up with the route, one needs to check on his/her root every now and then. Anam's trilogy exhibits a brilliant example of transgenerational search for identity. The novels also address how the subsequent generations inherit their previous generation's identity informed by the transmission of history.

Later, it was extended to June 30, 2022.But till date, only 50 percent of the work has been completed.As a result, hundreds of people using the highway every day, which connects Khulna and Barishal with North Bengal, continue to suffer.Tailbacks, potholes, dust flying around and vehicles getting dysfunctional have become a common scenario on the 62-km highway, of which 31km falls in Natore and the rest in Bogura.Roads and Highways Department (RHD) sources said the work to increase the width of 6.3 kilometres of the highway from 18 feet to 34 feet started in June 2020.Mir Habibul Islam Builders and Rana Builders got the contract for the project, which is worth Tk 81 crore. Besides, they were supposed to construct four lanes on 3.2 kilometres of the highway.The estimated cost of the entire project is Tk 740 crore.This isn't only a story about the slow progression of work.Last year, an investigative officer of the Police Bureau of Investigation  framed charges against the contractors following a local court order on charges of cutting soil from the side of the road.The trial of the court began at the court of additional chief judicial magistrate. However, the contractors filed a revision appeal against it. The case was then dismissed by the court district and sessions judge.Two sub-assistant engineers of  RHD were also transferred over various allegations surrounding the project.Ronen Roy, president of Sochetan Nagorik Committee Natore, said after the court took up the case, the contractor and RHD officials were left reeling. The work was stopped for a long time. After it restarted, it has been progressing at a snail's pace.Supreme Court lawyer Shihab Uddin Khan said it was proved that they illegally cut soil. They should be punished.Denying his involvement in anything illegal, contractor Mir Habibul Alam alias Bakhtiar claimed that the work is being delayed due to an increase in the price of construction materials.. He added that he will apply for a time extension again.Abdur Rahim, executive engineer of RHD in Natore, said, ""People are suffering because the contractor did not complete the work on time. Therefore, I have recommended the project manager to cancel the contract with the contractors.""Md Sadekul Islam, director of Natore-Bogra highway widening project, said a letter has been sent to cancel the contracts.Contacted, local lawmaker Zunaid Ahmed Palak, state minister for ICT, said, ""The people are suffering because the road work is not done on time.

/sports/football/news/bellingham-musiala-headline-dortmund-bayern-rivalry-3137671,"Bellingham, Musiala headline Dortmund-Bayern rivalry","Borussia Dortmund host Bayern Munich on Saturday with arguably the two sides' most important players, Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala, boasting a combined age of only 38.Recent meetings of Germany's two most successful clubs have often been billed as clashes between since-departed strikers Erling Haaland and Robert Lewandowski.Instead this weekend, Bellingham, who has captained Dortmund in their last two matches, will go up against good friend and former team-mate Musiala at Signal Iduna Park.The now 19-year-olds played together in multiple England youth teams growing up before Musiala opted to play senior international football for Germany, making his debut last year.Musiala has nailed down a place in Bayern's starting XI this season, repaying coach Julian Nagelsmann's faith with team-leading tallies in the Bundesliga of five goals and three assists.Bellingham's rise, to the extent he has worn Dortmund's captain's armband, has maybe been even more impressive -- and more crucial to his team.The England international netted for a third straight Champions League match in midweek during a 4-1 thumping of Sevilla in Spain.The youthful complexion of the teams goes beyond Bellingham and Musiala, however, with Dortmund's Karim Adeyemi and Giovanni Reyna and Bayern pair Mathys Tel and Ryan Gravenberch also nominated for this year's Golden Boy award, won two years ago by Haaland while he was at Dortmund."
/weekend-read/news/challenging-the-essence-iranian-regime-3137881,Challenging the essence of Iranian regime,"More than three weeks of protests have rocked Iran after a young woman died after being detained by the country's so-called morality police.The 22-year-old Mahsa Amini had travelled to Tehran with family from the northwestern Kurdistan province when she was detained for what the police deemed to be ""immodest clothing"" on September 13.Authorities claimed that she had a heart attack while staying in a ""guidance centre"" – a type of re-education centre where women are taught how to follow Iran's rules on female clothing. Her family has alleged that officers beat her head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles.She was declared dead on September 16 by state television after having spent three days in a coma. Iranians took to the streets across the country, calling for justice for Amini, angry at the authorities and morality police, who they blame for her death.Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based group, has said at least 133 people have been killed by security forces so far. State media have reported that more than 40 people have died, including security personnel.  Scores, including a number of journalists, students, lawyers and activists, have been arrested.After remaining silent for three weeks, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday blamed the US, Israel and ""some traitorous Iranians abroad"" for the protests. He urged security forces to be ready for more.The West has been vocal since the protests erupted.  The US has already imposed sanctions on Iran's morality police, and President Joe Biden said that this week his administration would ""impose further costs"" on those perpetrating violence against peaceful protesters. A number of Western countries summoned Iranian envoys to lodge protest against the crackdown.PROTESTS FLARE AT A DELICATE TIMEThe protests come at a delicate time for the regime. Anger has been simmering in Iran as years of US-led sanctions have hobbled its economy. Widespread corruption and economic mismanagement also played a big part. And Tehran's hope of improving the situation seems unlikely as talks on restoring the nuclear accord seems to have collapsed after glimpses of progress.The protests also come at a time when the world is going through a major geopolitical shift. Iran has been a vocal supporter of a new emerging bloc led by China-Russia, which is trying to pose a challenge to West's dominance.Now, despite the harsh crackdown, the demonstrations have become widespread, with demands broadening to reflect ordinary Iranians' anger over their living conditions.MANDATORY HIJAB AND PROTESTSAmini's case has touched a raw nerve and unleashed years of pent up anger over the mandatory hijab.In an unprecedented manner, Iranian women are challenging the country's Islamic dress code, waving and burning their veils. Some have publicly cut their hair as furious crowds called for the fall of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Under a law adopted in 1983, four years after Iran's Islamic revolution, all women, regardless of faith or nationality, must conceal their hair with a headscarf in public and wear loose fitting trousers under their coats. Violators face public rebuke, fines or arrest.But decades after the revolution, clerical rulers still struggle to enforce the law, with many women of all ages and backgrounds wearing tight-fitting, thigh-length coats and brightly coloured scarves pushed back to expose plenty of hair.While that defiance is common, the nationwide protests have raised the stakes as Iranian women call for more freedoms.In the first few days, Iranian media criticized the so called morality police. The day after her funeral, nearly all Iranian press dedicated their front pages to her story.Reformist political parties, and even influential clerics called on the government to listen to the people.However, that reformist tone has changed notably as protests spread. Presumably, under strict pressure from the regime, the media has projected the protests as an assault against religious values.Waves of the hijab protests have hit the clerical establishment in the past years. In 2014, rights activist Masih Alinejad started a Facebook campaign ""My Stealthy Freedom"", where she shared pictures of unveiled Iranian women sent to her. Her movement was followed in 2017 by a hashtag campaign encouraging women to wear white scarves on Wednesdays to protest laws requiring hijab. And in the months and years that followed, new photos and videos and stories of women removing their hijab or resisting the morality police flooded social media.Veiling in Muslim societies has always been heavily contingent on geographic, socioeconomic, and historical context, and in contemporary Iran, the issue has long been politicised. In 1936, the first Pahlavi shah issued a decree that prohibited veiling in a bid to modernise his country.The edict lapsed a few years later, when the shah was forced into exile and his young son took the helm. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi doubled down on his father's secular, pro-Western orientation, and in the 1970s, as anti-government activism gained momentum, many women consciously adopted headscarves or all-enveloping chadors as tangible rejections of the monarchy.Still, even from the start of the post-revolutionary era, the efforts by the state to impose and enforce hijab provoked intense resistance. In the weeks after the monarchy was toppled, hints of a crackdown on women's dress prompted some of the first protests of the post-revolutionary era, drawing thousands of women to the streets in March 1979 to warn that the imposition of headscarves by the new leadership threatened their rights.But the activism against hijab was also controversial from the start.In a country where women require a man's approval for travel and marriage, where laws surrounding divorce and custody and inheritance favour men, and where female labour force participation is among the lowest in the world despite high educational attainments, it's understandable that some downplay the significance of hijab as secondary to other matters such as political or gender equality rights.But the issue that most of us fail to understand is, for Iranian women, this whole hijab decision is imposed on them. For them, banning the hijab was imposed, so was the imposition of mandatory hijab. For them, it's not about the clothes, it's about the coercion.According to one independent study from 2020, 72 percent of Iranians are against mandatory hijab-wearing. By contrast, only 15 percent support it.QUESTIONING THE ESSENCE OF REGIMEFor the ruling clergy, the anti-hijab campaigns strike at the heart of the ideology that validates arbitrary and unaccountable power in Iran. To question hijab is to question the essence of the Islamic Republic, and to express those questions in a way that demonstrates impatience with the perennial assurances of ""peaceful reform"" confounds the deeply-held political narratives of many, both inside and outside Iran.Among the regime's senior leadership, mandatory hijab-wearing has become a nonnegotiable litmus test for anyone who professes loyalty to the Islamic Republic. Once mandatory hijab-wearing is challenged and potentially revoked, the thinking goes, opponents will simply move on to contest the regime's other cherished policies.Whether this ongoing protest can generate durable policy change, or even regime change, is hardly certain. Tehran has massive repressive capacity at its disposal that extends well into the online space.Iran was rocked by unrest in 2017 and 2018. In 2019, Iran said 200,000 people took part in what may have been the biggest anti-government demonstration in the 43-year history of the Islamic Republic. Reuters reported 1,500 were killed by security forces.All these protests were brutally suppressed."
/news/bangladesh/news/more-women-going-abroad-work-3137651,More women going abroad for work,"Hoping to ensure her family's bread and butter, Lucky Akhter (32) decided to migrate to the United Arab Emirates to work as a cleaner.A mother of three, Lucky said working at a company in Dubai will fetch her 800 dirhams a month for two years. This will be great for her four-member family in Narayanganj.""I want to raise my children properly and ensure a good future for them,"" she told this newspaper over the phone recently.She has a 17-year-old married daughter and two sons, who are 15 and four years old, respectively.She said the necessary procedures for her migration were completed through a recruiting agency in Dhaka, and a flight was expected in October 22.After a downturn amid the pandemic, Bangladesh is seeing an encouraging picture of women migrating for work this year, as thousands have already migrated.However, ensuring their safety and well-being in host countries remains a concern. Studies suggest female migrants often face various pre- and post-migration challenges.According to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET), this year, 76,579 women have gone overseas for jobs till August, with an average of 9,572 migrations per month.At this rate, the number of female-worker migrations this year is likely to surpass last year's and the pre-pandemic stage of 2019, when 1.04 lakh women went abroad.Last year, 80,143 women went abroad for jobs, while the number in 2020, amid the pandemic, was only 21,934, BMET data show.Between 1991 and August this year, about 10.8 lakh female workers migrated to different countries, according to BMET.While this year's numbers are encouraging, there are reasons to be worried about their safety abroad, said Sumaiya Islam, executive director of Bangladesh Nari Sramik Kendra.Sumaiya said this year, many women from rural areas of Khulna and Manikganj migrated abroad because their families face debt, which they incurred during the pandemic.Also, undocumented returnee male migrants, who returned home empty-handed amid the pandemic, could not re-migrate. As a result, many women from such families intend to go abroad to make ends meet, she added.Sumaiya said they receive phone calls from women workers from abroad and their families. They complain about the lack of safety measures.She stressed providing proper training for these workers and their orderly migration, to avoid exploitation abroad.This year, Saudi Arabia remains the top work destination, with 48,727 women hired. Besides, Oman hired 13,232 women, Jordan 10,229, and UAE 1,248, BMET data show.In a field-level study, Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program (Okup) found that of 156 Saudi-returnee women, 80 returned home before completion of the two-year contract, while 50 returned within a year.Okup provided reintegration support to the returnee women between April 2020 and July 2022.Okup in its 2021 study report ""Access to Justice for Bangladeshi Migrant Workers: Opportunities and Challenges"", conducted with 262 female migrants, found that nearly 45 percent of the women had not received the promised wages and benefits.About 88 percent were not provided with a written job contract before migration, it says.A 2019 expatriates' welfare ministry report found that irregular payment and physical and sexual torture were the top reasons for the early return of over 100 women from Saudi Arabia.In many cases, challenges faced by female migrant workers are ignored, said Okup Chairperson Shakirul Islam.""Instead, there is a tendency in the government to blame their [migrants'] lack of knowledge for falling into a vulnerable situation,"" he said.Most women migrate abroad to work as domestic workers, and the government support service for those facing challenges is not satisfactory yet, he added.He urged the government to take steps so that the women get paid on time, communicate with their families uninterruptedly, and remit money home without hassle.Asked, an official of BMET admitted that there are challenges regarding female migration from Bangladesh.""We try our level best to mitigate the challenges,"" the official told this newspaper over the phone, preferring anonymity.The Bangladesh government from time to time raises issues before the host countries, while the bureau also arranges hearings to resolve disputes regarding female migration, the official added."
/news/bangladesh/news/are-we-consuming-tannery-waste-3137621,Are we consuming tannery waste?,"First, a gang smuggles solid wastes of leather (leftovers after cutting and trimming) from the Savar Tannery Industrial Estate.  Then it sells them to poultry and fish feed producing factories around  the country.Later, the chicken and fish, consuming these wastes, end up on the plates of citizens.You don't need to be a health expert to understand how such practices pose public health hazards.During multiple visits to the tannery estate, this correspondent  spoke to many officials, staffers and truck drivers. Most of them did  not want to talk about the issue in detail, but they all more or less  admitted to the fact that these solid wastes are indeed getting smuggled  and being sold to animal feed producing factories.But what's scarier is that this has been going on for a while. The High Court in 2019 directed the government to immediately stop  operation of poultry and fish feed  factories across the country that  use hazardous tannery waste for  producing feed.""A variety of chemicals, including chromium, are used to make animal  feed from these wastes. These chemicals have the potential for deadly  diseases, including cancer, in the human body,"" reads a Bangladesh Small  and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) statement on the issue  dating back to early this year.Savar upazila livestock officer Dr Md Sajedul Islam also said use of  tannery waste is completely prohibited in poultry industry. This waste  carries heavy metals and hazardous chemicals that are harmful for  health.  However, the smuggling of tannery wastes continues to this date,  although the authorities and police claim that they have a  zero-tolerance policy in this regard. The industrial area has 141 operational  tanneries and one dedicated dumping station for solid waste, which is around six acres. They usually  dump these solid wastes in a dedicated station  and leave them there. According to officials, around 64,000 tonnes of  solid waste is produced per year.Staff and transport workers in the tannery estate alleged that the  gang go to the estate's dumping stations late at night or early morning  with trucks, then load it with solid tannery waste and leave the area.""A section of insiders including members of the authorities,  security guards  and law enforcers are helping this gang,"" alleged Nayan  Miah, a truck driver for the tannery estate.Sometimes, the authorities seize trucks laden with solid waste. But  later they release it through underhand dealings, said another worker,  seeking anonymity.Visiting the estate premises recently, this correspondent saw two  such trucks -- Dhaka Metro Dr 14-6047 and Dhaka Metro Dr 12-1271 -- kept  parked near the Waste Treatment Plant Company Limited. They were filled  with seized solid wastes.""We have seized the two trucks. We will hand over those to police soon,"" said an official of the estate.He also alleged that law enforcers in most of the cases do not take  action against these illegal traders.

However, it did not happen this year,"" he said. ""And when it rained, the water couldn't be stored because of dysfunctional sluicegates.  If such situations prevail, most farmlands will become barren,"" he added.The upazila has a total of 121km of embankments where 23 sluicegates were constructed to control water levels and flow rates in rivers and canals. They were also used as wastewater treatment plants.According to WDB, the eight damaged sluice gates are in Kashiabad Forest Station, Nayani, Kushodanga, Kathmarchar, Oratala, Padmapukur, Binapani and Hajatkhali areas.The rest in Naksha, Masjid Kur, Amadi, Khoralkathi, Shalukkhali, Hogla, Lalua, Narayanpur, Gobindpur, Sutia Bazar, Gariyabari, Jorshing and Koyra-2 areas have become vulnerable.Koyra upazila chairman SM Shofiqul Islam said most of the sluice gates installed in the 1990s are yet to be repaired.""Eight have completely become dysfunctional due to a lack of maintenance. Besides, cyclone Amphan damaged the Hajatkhali sluice gate,"" he said.""Even four years after the collapse, the Oratala sluicegate near Guchchhogram is yet to be repaired. Aman production is being hampered as a result,"" he added.Chapal Kumar, a farmer from Gariyabari area, said, ""We are facing a lack of irrigation water during this peak season of Aman cultivation due to less rain and damaged sluice gates.""This correspondent recently visited at least 12 villages -- including Nayani, Kushodanga, Kathmarchar, Oratala, Padmapukur, Binapani, Hajatkhali Shalukkhali, Hogla, Lalua -- where almost all sluicegates were found inoperative.Mud and silt blocked the entrances of those sluicegates, of which iron parts were rusting.Md Asaduzzaman, agriculture officer of Koyra upazila, said around 14,720 hectares of land have been used for Aman cultivation this year. Farmers do not get required facilities from these sluice gates, he said.""They need to be renovated urgently,"" he added.Mashiul Abedin, assistant engineer of BWDB in Koyra, said a list of dysfunctional sluice gates have already been sent to the headquarters for reconstruction.

Known for its snow-topped Himalayan mountains, fast-flowing rivers, Mughal-era gardens, Alpine meadows and houseboats around a beautiful lake, the federal territory has seen a resurgence in domestic tourism since most Covid-19 restrictions ended this year. The record tourist arrivals are a boon for Modi's government, which withdrew Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir's special rights in 2019, stripping it of its status as a state in reforms it said were aimed at integrating it with the rest of the country.

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.Dry conditions in Argentina and the United States have also contributed to the increase in global cereal prices.The FAO lowered its world cereal production forecast for this year again, with a decline of 1.7 percent expected.The agency said 45 countries, including 33 in Africa, nine in Asia, two in Latin America and the Caribbean, and one in Europe ""are in need of external assistance for food"".The UN warned in September that more than one million people are at risk of famine and death without humanitarian aid."

/weekend-read/news/the-history-hijab-iran-3137876,The history of hijab in Iran,"This is not the first time when a woman has been assaulted in Iran for not wearing a hijab properly. Many such cases have come to light, while many still are unreported. Women in Iran have been protesting against these cruelties, for a long time. But it was always not the case. Women in Iran have also donned hijab as a symbol of resistance against oppression, monarchy.REZA SHAH AND MODERNIZATION OF IRANAt the end of the 19th century landowners, merchants, intellectuals and Shia clerics had a significant influence on Iranian society. They came together in the constitutional revolution but failed to overthrow the Qajar regime.However, this revolution led to the rise of General Reza Khan, the commander of the elite Persian Cossack Brigade (also the founder of the Pahlavi Dynasty). In 1925, with the help of the United Kingdom, he came into power and established a constitutional monarchy.Reza Shah was heavily influenced by the UK and USA. Years after reigning in Iran, he introduced a lot of social, economic, and political reforms. He replaced Islamic laws with the western laws of modern times.He put a ban on Islamic clothing, separation of the sexes, and veiling of women's faces with hijab or burqa. Reza Shah was so committed towards these reforms that in 1936, he implemented Kashf-e-Hijab.That is, if a woman wears a hijab, the police have the right to remove it. Behind all this reform, his major aim was to weaken the influence of conservatives in society, who collectively supported the traditional belief system.The shah regarded Iranian hijab and traditional costumes as a sign of 'backwardness,' and tried also to compel men to wear what he regarded as 'western' costumes and hats.The religious establishment which saw, and still sees, the unveiling of women as a blow to its values and power, strongly opposed the decree and Reza Shah's other attempts at modernization.Implementation of the ban eased, and many women went back to traditional ways of dressing when Reza Shah went into exile in 1941 due to his German sympathies and under British pressure for the succession of his son Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.He was also greatly influenced by western culture.  For aggressive modernisation of the country, he launched the 'White Revolution' in 1963 giving women the right to vote. In 1967, Iran's personal law was also reformed in which women got equal rights. The age of marriage for girls was also raised from 13 to 18 years and abortion was also made legal.In the last few years before the Islamic Revolution of 1979, wearing headscarves became popular among those in the younger generation who often saw it as a means to express their political opposition to the monarchy and its westernisation of the Iranian society.RISE OF CONSERVATIVES AND ISLAMIC LAWShia religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini opposed these policies of Shah. He became a prominent face in opposition to the White Revolution in 1963. He was arrested two times and sent into exile for 15 years.The collapse of the economy paved way for dissent.Away from the public view, Khomeini preached the idea of the Islamic Republic, sharia law, and the idea of an Islamic government through books and cassettes. In 1978, under his leadership, two million people gathered at Shahyad Chowk, in Tehran to protest against Shah. Interestingly, women in large numbers also took an active part in this revolution.In 1979, fearing execution, Reza Pahlavi fled the country and Iran became the Islamic Republic. Khomeini was made the Supreme Leader of Iran.Women's rights were plundered at the onset of the Khomeini regime. In 1981, the use of cosmetic products was banned, and in 1983 wearing the hijab became mandatory. The Islamic government abolished the reforms of the Family Protection Law of 1967 and the age of marriage for girls was reduced from 18 years to 9 years."

But this year, the government hiked the price to Tk 109. So, various industries have been struggling to remain productive while managing soaring operational costs, wrote BGMEA to the prime minister.Due to the global situation, there is no scope of reducing fuel prices in the local market.Due to the global situation, there is no scope of reducing fuel prices in the local market.On August 5, the government hiked fuel prices by up to 51.7 percent, and later, reduced them by up to 4.39 percent.About Tuesday's grid failure, Hamid said the matter will be made clear after the probe body's report.

/star-holiday/news/kashmir-heaven-earth-3137896,Kashmir a heaven on earth,"After passing the passports and tickets to an immigration officer at Dhaka airport, I was lost in thoughts reflecting on the last couple of years. Though the worst days of the Covid-19 pandemic were over, the stagnant, restricted life was still vivid in my memory.How we all yearned for a pandemic-free world of unrestricted travelling!A benign cough from the immigration officer brought me back to the present.  ""Hello, Covid vaccine certificate please, ""he asked, reminding me of the post-pandemic ""new normal"" rules.During the pandemic, like many, I too had planned many trips in my mind. An opportunity came during the long Eid-ul-Fitr vacation and, my wife and I took it.  We were at the airport for a three-day trip to Kashmir.We reached Delhi after a two and half hour's flight. We grabbed a quick meal utilising the 2 hours before our next flight to Srinagar.Delhi to Srinagar was a 1.45-hour flight and an hour into it, Kashmir started to reveal its glamour and grandeur through the window. The views of the majestic Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas from above were superb.At the parking lot of the airport, Ferdous Bhai, our tour guide and driver, was waiting for us with a smile on his face. To our surprise, he could speak little Bengali.The beauty of the spring season in Kashmir kept our tired eyes open throughout our two-hour journey to Pahalgam, where stayed for the night.Located about 100 kilometres from Srinagar, Pahalgam, the jewel of the picturesque Liddar Valley located in the high Himalayas, is famous for its scenic beauty. By the time we reached there, it was already dark. After dinner, we had a walk in the near-empty local market.The next morning, on ponies, we set out for Aru Valley. 12 kilometres from Pahalgam, many consider this place the most beautiful of all the tourist spots in the area.We enjoyed the pony ride on lush meadows surrounded by mountains with snow-capped peaks and pine forests.However, by the time we reached there, the weather turned gloomy and soon, it started raining. This apparent setback was a blessing in disguise.  We enjoyed the rain with cups of warm tea. It was wonderful.Our next destination was Betaab Valley, another popular location among tourists and even Kashmiris, previously known as Hagan Valley. The renaming of the valley happened after the shooting of a hit Bollywood film called Betaab there.The entire setting was very scenic with the Lidder River flowing right next to it. With crystal-clear turquoise water, the beauty of this fast-moving river is hard to describe.Unfortunately, we were not permitted to approach Chandanwari, a tourist spot 8 km further away from Betaab Valley, as landslides, a common incident during the early spring season, triggered by rain blocked the road.That day, we left Pahalgam and reached Srinagar, where we stayed for the night. Our next spot was Sonamarg, which is approximately 80km away from the summer capital of Kashmir.The presence of the Indian military was noticeable in Sonamarg as it was near the Kargil, a focal point of the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan. However, other than facing a few regular security checkpoints on the way, we didn't face any adverse situations.The journey to Sonamarg, a gateway of the ancient Silk Road that connects Kashmir with China, became a pleasure trip as Ferdous Bhai from his driving seat recalled all the famous movies which were shot on this road.After reaching Sonamarg, situated at an altitude of 2730m with huge Himalayan Mountains in the backdrop, we decided to trek towards Thajiwas Glacier.It took us almost three hours to trek to the glacier site, enjoying a few moments there and coming back. In the evening, we returned to Srinagar and spent some time at the night market nearby our hotel to collect souvenirs.On the next morning, we started for Gulmarg which means ""Meadow of Flowers"". Gulmarg crowns the world's highest golf course and is also a popular destination for skiing.We hired a local guide and rented ponies to get to Snow Point, where we enjoyed a sledge ride. While returning, we stopped at factory outlets to see how famous Kashmiri pashmina shawls were made.We returned to Srinagar that night.Our stay in a houseboat at the Dal Lake in Srinagar was the tour's highlight. With a touch of luxury, we loved our stay at the floating house. We experienced a tranquil, surreal sunrise at Dal Lake.Later in the morning, we hired a Shikara (boat) to explore the lake. We also embarked on a sightseeing tour in and around Srinagar and enjoyed some Kashmiri cuisines like Wazwan, Kashmiri Biryani – which were distinct in taste and colour due to the presence of indigenous spices.On the final leg of the trip, we did some quick shopping and then started for the Srinagar airport.Soon, a sense of gloom engulfed us.

""It is the united efforts of what we call civil society that can stand up against authoritarian states and, or, human rights abuses.""She called on Belarus to release Byalyatski from prison and said the prize was not aimed against Putin.Belarusian security police in July last year raided offices and homes of lawyers and human rights activists, detaining Byalyatski and others in a new crackdown on opponents of Lukashenko.Authorities had moved to shut down non-state media outlets and human right groups after mass protests the previous August against a presidential election the opposition said was rigged.""The (Nobel) Committee is sending a message that political freedoms, human rights and active civil society are part of peace,"" Dan Smith, head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, told Reuters.The prize will boost morale for Byalyatski and strengthen the hand of the Center for Civil Liberties, an independent Ukrainian human rights organisation, which is also focused on fighting corruption, he said.""Although Memorial has been closed in Russia, it lives on as an idea that it's right to criticize power and that facts and history matter,"" Smith added.In Geneva, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations said Moscow was not concerned about the award. ""We don't care about this,"" Gennady Gatilov told Reuters.In Belarus, the award was not reported by state media.Founded in 1989 to help the victims of political repression during the Soviet Union and their relatives, Memorial campaigns for democracy and civil rights in Russia and former Soviet republics. Its co-founder and first leader was Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.Memorial, Russia's best-known human rights group, was ordered to be dissolved last December for breaking a law requiring certain civil society groups to register as foreign agents, capping a year of crackdowns on Kremlin critics unseen since Soviet days.Memorial board member Anke Giesen said winning the award was recognition of its human rights work and of colleagues who continue to suffer ""unspeakable attacks and reprisals"" in Russia.The award to Memorial is the second in a row to a Russian, after the prize to journalist Dmitry Muratov last year, shared with Maria Ressa of the Philippines.The executive director of Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties, Oleksandra Romantsova, said winning the award was ""incredible"".""It is great, thank you,"" she told the secretary of the award committee, Olav Njoelstad, during a phone call that was filmed and broadcast on Norwegian television. The group also tweeted it was proud.The Nobel Peace Prize, worth 10 million Swedish crowns, or about $900,000, will be presented in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will."

However, batting will remain an area of concern for the hosts, especially after they were bundled out for just 70 runs by Pakistan.Opener Murshida Khatun, who scored a fifty against Malaysia, believed there was a chance if the Tigresses could play according to their plan.""Whenever we play against India or Pakistan, our energy level is at its peak. They [India] are stronger than us since they play a lot of matches and recently played in England. But we are also in good shape and some of our batters are in good touch. If we can play according to the process, we can expect a positive result. We are the defending champions and we will be playing at home,"" Murshida told the media ahead of the game against India yesterday.In yesterday's affair, Pakistan were bolstered by an all-round display from Nida Dar, who top-scored with 56 runs and also scalped two crucial wickets.Pakistan were in a spot of bother after electing to bat and were struggling on 33 for three before Nida and skipper Bismah Maroof added a 76-run fourth-wicket stand to take them to a competitive total.Maroof was dismissed after making 32 off 35 balls, but Nida remained unbeaten on 56 off just 37 balls, hitting five fours and a six.In reply, India failed to continue their brilliant batting performance and were tottering on 91 for seven.Richa Ghosh, coming in at number eight, returned to the pavilion due to heat-related issues before returning in a blistering mood. She struck 26 off just 13 balls, but it was always going to be a difficult task. After her dismissal, it was all over India."

/star-literature/news/alice-beck-kehoes-girl-archaeologist-and-gender-relations-us-society-3137746,Alice Beck Kehoe’s Girl Archaeologist and gender relations in US society,"Alice Beck Kehoe (1934-) is a family friend, and I have her permission to use her first name in short for this essay. After reading Alice's autobiography Girl Archaeologist: Sisterhood in a Sexist Profession (2022), Raudah, my wife, recommended the book to me with confidence that I would love it.Given my training in feminist literature, the title of the book immediately sparked my enthusiasm. I read it voraciously and conceived an idea of using it for major research. The content of the book extends across a whole spectrum of issues including gender, class, race, Native Americans (First Nations), anti-Semitism, ethnocentrism, ethnohistory, pre-Columbian America, politics, colonialism, (the ""moral imperative"" of) postcolonialism and the decolonization of education. All these made it important for me to engage with the book. In what follows, I will focus mainly on its feminist aspect.Women in the US today are increasingly visible in public life and have access to many opportunities to exploit their talents and capabilities in almost all sectors. But their condition was quite different in Alice's early days. For example, female education is now taken for granted, but Alice had to fight cultural myths and gender stereotypes to have a fair chance at reaching her full potential in educational attainment. In Girl Archaeologist, she opens a window into an America of the pre-1964 Civil Rights Act where male privilege was quite pervasive. In the book, she shares her experiences as a Jewish girl, woman, wife, mother and academic.During her high school days in the 1950s, being a good student and bicycling to school bore a double burden of stigma for girls. This constituted a reason why a male classmate was afraid to date Alice in those days, fearing negative social judgment. It was also not considered appropriate for girls to go hiking or enjoy ecstatic mountain views.Alice's father adopted a ""masculine judgment"" and believed that women should be homemakers and therefore did not need formal education, as ""the thinking"" was considered men's job and manual household work, women's. He believed that women who went to college were sluts and whores.Young women had to abandon their education upon marriage in order to run households, raise children and keep the family together so that their husbands could focus on work in academic and other fields. A generation earlier, Alice's mother stopped composing poetry ""the year she married.""Interestingly, even though women's education faced headwinds and their entry into prestigious sites of learning such as Harvard was denied, their intellectual abilities manifested perhaps in unrecognized ways. Many academic husbands had their wives at home write and publish for them to get tenure – a widely-condoned practice of plagiarism. Or, in academic administration, where a male Head of Department was not very capable of performing his job, his female assistant or secretary managed the department.At an early age, Alice developed interest in anthropology and archaeology. Academic disciplines like these were off limits for women. Despite that, through a tortuous and obstacle-strewn path, Alice stands very high as an anthropologist and archaeologist. Her struggle bumped her up to the post of president of the Association of Senior Anthropologists, a branch of the American Anthropological Association. She held this position from 2003 to 2008.In the autobiography, Alice narrates stories of hostility to women in academic settings. For instance, in 1958, in an academic conference, she sat in a back row with her baby boy to listen to a presentation. Even though her son was asleep and didn't cause any disruption whatsoever, both of them were physically forced out of the conference venue.At Harvard, one male professor was reluctant to let Alice enroll in his course because she was pregnant. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended such discrimination on the basis of race, religion and sex. At Harvard, one male professor was reluctant to let Alice enroll in his course because she was pregnant. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended such discrimination on the basis of race, religion and sex. Publications in her field were dominated by men who ""hardly mentioned women"" in their writings. In 1977, all these prompted Alice and her sister academics to organize an archaeological session and title it ""The Hidden Half."" With passion and perseverance, she and other women professionals broke out of the cycle of sexism and overcame ""thickets of disrespect"" and ""a lot of condescendence."" Alice's lifetime has coincided with the transition from male to female numerical superiority in archaeology with implications for the modes and methods of research in the subject.Among the many challenges women academics during Alice's career faced was husbands' refusal to share the responsibilities of childrearing and home management. In her family life, her husband ""never did any housework or child care or cooking and precious little yardwork"" (97). Conversely, Alice had to do ""teaching, committee duties, cooking, grocery shopping, cleaning, laundry, yardwork, the PTA [Parent-Teacher Association], and the Cub Scouts pack"" she and a female friend ran for their sons (97). This evasive attitude of husbands to working wives forced most women anthropologists to make the difficult choice between motherhood and career.A common form of gender discrimination was the absence of recognition for women academics. Despite a Harvard PhD in anthropology under her name, Alice was considered only a woman and a wife, and not a professional, whereas her non-PhD husband ""looked like an archaeologist"" because of his gender.Given that Alice had an archaeologist husband, one extremely well-meaning Harvard professor advised her against writing a dissertation in archaeology so that people would not presume that her husband did the research for her. Hence, despite her deeper interest and years-long experience in archaeology, she had to choose cultural anthropology for her doctoral research. The title of her memoir – Girl Archaeologist – marks her defiance of the notion that she could not become an archaeologist independent of her husband. Alice entered Harvard as a PhD candidate in 1957, but her enrolment was in the university's Radcliffe College. Two years later, in 1959, Harvard acknowledged female students, so Alice's degree was awarded by it. Opened in 1949 and established mainly for undergraduate library services, Harvard's Lamont Library denied entry to women ""so that the men studying there would not be distracted"" (63). The library opened its doors to women in 1967 and the official merger of Radcliffe College with Harvard University occurred in April 1999.At Harvard, one male professor was reluctant to let Alice enroll in his course because she was pregnant. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended such discrimination on the basis of race, religion and sex. That was the year when Alice completed her PhD, so the landmark legislation didn't make any difference for her student life at Harvard.Upon graduation, Alice continued to face gender discrimination. One of her employers refused to put her on tenure track on account of her gender. Finally, she became a professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, but upon retirement she found out that she ""had been paid nearly 30 percent less than a man with [her] years in rank and a good publication record"" (89). Her gender has always coloured her career and somewhat overshadowed her achievements as an academic.As Alice mentions in Girl Archaeologist, in the US, gender and race coalesced as a system for oppression. For example, she refers to a Columbia University law professor, the African American Patricia J. Williams, whose great-great-grandmother Sophie, aged 11, was purchased by a white man ""to practice sex upon her in preparation for his marriage to a young lady"" (xiv).On a final note, Girl Archaeologist shows that the America of Alice's early life was not what it is like now. Interestingly, many aspects of her gendered experiences and the male domination she experienced resonate with South Asian cultural beliefs and gender norms, especially those described in the work of Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880-1932). That itself is an interesting point for a separate study. Md. Mahmudul Hasan currently teaches at International Islamic University Malaysia.Email: mmhasan@iium.edu.my"

The 19-year-old was an age-level national football player, who played with the likes of Rupna Chakma, Ritu Porna Chakma, Anuching Mogini and Anai Mogini – the household names in the country after the women's national team clinched the prestigious SAFF Championship title in September.""They are my friends. We played together at the Mogachari primary school, Ghagra high school and later at the national level. They are all playing and I cannot even run. This is hurting me every second,"" said Chathuima, who had won the golden boot in the 2012 Bangamata Gold Cup Tournament when her Ghagra high school became runners-up before she featured in the U-14, U-16 teams for Bangladesh.It was all going great for the talented footballer until she tore a ligament in 2014. Ever since, the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) sidelined her out from all kind of football activities, informed Chathuima.""When I got injured at the end of 2014, they [BFF] gave me Tk 2-3 thousand, told me to get good treatment with the money and sent me home. But at that time I needed way more money than that. So, I couldn't take the timely treatment. Later in 2016, I went through surgery after getting financial aid from Bangladesh Army and some kind individuals.""""However, still my leg injury is far from healed. I still can't walk well, can't climb the mountain,"" said Chathuima, who further said that the BFF officials did not keep track of her even once.Financial stability-wise, Chathuima fell into a slippery slope since injury. ""There was no shortage of money when I played. My family was under a lot of financial trouble following injury. In 2018, I managed a job at a shoe factory,"" informed Chathuima, while adding that her Tk 9,000 salary is barely enough as her family -- involving 60-plus aged parents and a younger sister -- is heavily dependent on her earnings.Asked about Chathuima not availing rehabilitation assistance, Golam Rabbani Choton, head coach of the SAFF Championship-winning women's team, told The Daily Star: ""Chathuima had potential.

External agents such as solar radiation liberate the loosely bound atoms more easily thus acting as a source of the atoms in the lunar exosphere,"" said the ISRO.Ground telescopes have taken images of faint sodium glow around moon, which is just the color of light emitted by a sodium vapor lamp, according to ISRO.What has been elusive is the source of these atoms on moon's surface, the ISRO said adding the new findings from Chandrayaan-2 provide an avenue to study surface-exosphere interaction on moon, which would help development of similar models for mercury and other airless bodies in the solar system and beyond."

/star-holiday/news/nilgiri-the-land-clouds-3137806,Nilgiri: the land of clouds,"It was a chilly Thursday night in Dhaka. We, my mom and I, were waiting to board our bus, and I was panicking. My uncle, aunt, grandma, grandpa, and a younger cousin were running late for the 11:15 pm bus. And it was already 11:05 pm.I was relieved when I noticed them on the other side of the street. I frantically waved my hands at them, hoping they would see me.Luckily, they did.At last, we all boarded the bus to Bandarban, where we would stay two nights at the Nilgiri Hill Resort.I slept for most of the 6 hours journey. When I woke up, it was morning.After arriving in Bandarban, we went to a restaurant for breakfast. I would be honest here; I didn't enjoy it. The parathas were too cold. After that, we took a car ride to reach the resort.The three-hour journey was spectacular. As our car moved along the scenic road, the different shapes of mountains and clouds were a treat to my eyes.We reached the resort around 11:00 am and went to our respective rooms. After unpacking my bag, I went to my uncle's room and was astonished by the view from his verandah.The surrounding green hills, the meandering Sangu River at the bottom and the moving clouds were a spectacle to behold. Soon after, we had lunch. The menu was chicken salad, bamboo chicken, lentil soup and rice. I went for bamboo chicken and rice. My tongue got blistered eating that tasty but excessively spicy food.We all spent the evening sitting on the verandah enjoying the views. My mom and aunt served us snacks and tea. We ate freshly collected bananas too.However, at dinner, I hardly could eat. The welcoming aroma of the local cuisine was mouth-watering, but my blisters prevented me from tasting the delicacies. Wasi Ibrahim Raiid is a student of class 8 in the Summerfield International School
After dinner, we had a memorable walk around the resort. The soft moonlight lit everything around us, including the clouds surrounding us. It was, as if, we were walking inside the clouds!
It was cold outside, but the touch of the wet clouds was soothing.
And the clouds were moving fast. In one moment, they were encircling us; the next moment, they were far gone to another mountain.
 








The rest of the night went pretty well despite my encounter with a giant spider. But that's a different story.
On the second day, we went to the helipad. The greenery, the white clouds over the valley, the crisp air – all made that sunny day magical.
From the Nilgiri hilltop, I could even see lighthouses and ships in the far Bay of Bengal using my uncle's monocular.
We spent the rest of the day exploring the resort and taking pictures. It was so windy that the thought of wind turbines came to my mind. Surely, the turbines, if installed there, would produce enough electricity to power the resort or, at least, part of it.
The wind was stronger during the night. I had to wear a blanket to even go to the verandah. There, I saw two gigantic lizards just outside my room. I confess I was not a fan of the bugs in this place. Every insect there was ginormous!
 








Apart from a few incidents with the bugs and insects, I enjoyed the rest of the trip. The views there would stay with me for a long time. It was one of the best experiences I ever had. And this could be your next family vacation place too.  
How to go there: You can go to Bandarban by your own car or by bus. From there to Nilgiri, you can hire a jeep. You can also go to Chattogram by air then take a bus or hire a car to Bandarban. 
About Nilgiri Hill Resort: If you want to touch the clouds, Nilgiri is the place to visit. The resort, on the Nilgiri Hills, is maintained by the Bangladesh Army. It is about 45 kilometres away from Bandarban district headquarters. My uncle and aunt had access to it as they served in the army. You must book at least a month before to get a room in this coveted resort.

/tech-startup/science-gadgets-and-tech/tech-news/news/google-ups-its-smartphone-game-latest-pixel-7-3137986,Google ups its smartphone game with latest Pixel 7,"Google is looking to up its smartphone game with the Pixel 7, the latest entrant in a competitive corner of personal electronics where it has traditionally been a bit player.The device was unveiled this week in Brooklyn, where representatives from the Mountain View, California giant highlighted top-flight features that can silence background noise on the phone.First introduced in 2016, the Pixel was a late-comer to the portable phone trend, arriving nearly a decade after Apple's iPhone and seven years after Samsung's Galaxy model, the two products that dominate today's market.In 2020, global deliveries of the Google phone were just 2.7 million, next to more than 200 million for both the Apple and Samsung options.Those paltry sales figures are partly due to the Google phone's limited availability, with the Pixel 5 sold in less than 10 countries as the tech giant has focused its smartphone investment on software rather than its own hardware.While Google's phones are comparable in terms of quality to the top sellers, the product ""has often lacked backing from Google"" in terms of marketing, said Runar Bjørhovde, a research analyst at market research firm Canalys.Google has instead focused on boosting its Android operating system, which was launched in 2008 and included more than 80 percent of the smartphones sold in the first half of 2022, according to Canalys.Maurice Klaehne of Counterpoint Research said that ""Google certainly has the capability and resources to become a major smartphone player, but that is not Pixel's strategy,"" noting that growing Android remains Google's main objective.But ""Selling more Pixel devices might mean taking away share from other Android players, and this would go against Pixel's goal,"" he said.Bjørhovde noted that, with the latest version of the phone, Google has pivoted somewhat, releasing a product that is compatible with wearables, earbuds and other devices produced by the company.Wonders of AIThe prior phone version, the Pixel 6, was the first to employ Tensor processing developed by Google to enable more sophisticated artificial intelligence and machine learning.The Pixel 7 has a second-generation Tensor, the G2, which can make blurry photos more clear, excise distracting extras from photos and remove the background noise on telephone calls.The upgraded system also can translate language in real-time, including idioms, and transmit more nuanced photos of different skin tones.At a launch event, Google vice president Rick Osterloh said the new product ""represents years of development across Google, and a long-term investment in the Pixel portfolio.""The company has seen an uptick in sales, reaching 6.2 million Pixels in the 12 months ending June 30, 2022, up 129 percent from the prior 12-month stretch, according to figures from Canalys.This includes a doubling in market share in the United States, where Pixel now only accounts for two percent of smartphone sales.Priced at $599 in the United States, the Pixel 7 is being positioned as relatively affordable. The latest versions of the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy are both around $800.Google has been bolstering its Pixel marketing, partnering with the NBA professional basketball league.The company also plans to distribute Pixel 7 in 17 countries, compared to 13 markets for the prior version.""Google has the potential to become a long-term player in the smartphone market,"" said Bjørhovde. ""However, it will be dependent upon global scale and breaking into new markets to achieve this and create a profitable business that can last."""

""If you can manage food, you can manage anything else.""He said the GDP growth is above 6 percent in Bangladesh whereas it is around 3 percent in many other countries.""Bangladesh works on the basis of reality. So, there is no reason to worry,"" he said. Momen arrived in Sylhet yesterday afternoon on a two-day tour.   "

/news/bangladesh/news/govt-ask-imf-45b-loan-assistance-3137801,Govt to ask IMF for 4.5b loan assistance,"A Bangladesh delegation will discuss a $4.5 billion loan with International Monetary Fund officials in Washington next week.The delegation led by Bangladesh Bank Governor Abdur Rouf Talukder is scheduled to leave for Washington on Sunday.The delegation has plans to hold a number of meetings with the IMF officials on the sidelines of the World Bank and IMF's annual meetings from October 10 to October 16, said officials at Bangladesh Bank and finance ministry.The first meeting will be held with Rahul Anand, chief of IMF Asia and Pacific Division, and his team on October 11. There will be another meeting with IMF Deputy Managing Director Antoinette M Sayeh the same day, the sources said.There will also be meetings with different IMF teams on October 13 in Washington, sources said.The conditions for the loan will be discussed when Rahul Anand visits Dhaka at the end of this month.During the visit, the IMF team will meet Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal.Once the agreement is reached, which usually takes a few months, the loan programme will be sent to the IMF executive board. Disbursements are made after the board approves the programme.The IMF's standard practice is to work closely with the authorities to come up with a programme that is most relevant to the borrowing country's economic and social dynamics.Bangladesh's economy was still recovering from the losses of the pandemic when the Russia-Ukraine war began in February, disrupting global supply chains and eventually causing inflation in many countries including Bangladesh.Uncertainties over the forex reserve also became a major concern.On August 4, the country's foreign exchange reserve was around $36 billion, down from around $46 billion at the same time last year.The IMF's standard practice is to work closely with the authorities to come up with a programme that is most relevant to that country's economic and social dynamics.The $4.5 billion loan to be discussed next week will be a three-year reform programme, the sources said.Of the amount, $1.5 billion is likely to be disbursed this year if the talks bring positive outcomes.The reasons why the fund is being sought include the country's climate financing needs and to cushion the impact of war in Ukraine.Part of it will come from IMF's newly created Resilience and Sustainability Trust. Loans from RST come with a 20-year maturity and a ten-and-a-half-years grace period. The IMF has come up with a three-tier interest rate structure based on the country's income.Bangladesh can get up to $1.5 billion from the RST, which targets specific areas within the mandate of the IMF.The government's request for a fund programme will ease the financing constraints and allow for advancing the efforts to manage fiscal, monetary and financial stability risks in light of climate change and recent global developments.Sources said the Bangladesh delegation will also meet Martin Raiser, World Bank vice president for South Asia, next week to discuss a $500 million loan.The delegation is also likely to discuss a $1 billion loan from the World Bank.Bangladesh is expected to get more than $3 billion from the World Bank, IMF and other lenders this fiscal year."

That was a contrast to just a week ago when he staged a huge concert on Red Square to proclaim the annexation of nearly a fifth of Ukrainian land.In a clear repudiation of Putin's record, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Russia's most prominent human rights group, Memorial, which Moscow shut down over the past year. A Ukrainian human rights group and a jailed campaigner against abuses by the pro-Russian government in Belarus were also awarded.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv's forces were swiftly recapturing more territory, including more than 500 sq km in the south where they burst through a second major front this week.Meanwhile, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov yesterday called on Russian troops to lay down their arms, promising them ""life and safety.""Biden said the prospect of defeat could make Putin desperate enough to use nuclear weapons, the biggest risk since US President John Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev faced off over missiles in Cuba in 1962, reports Reuters.""We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis,"" Biden said in New York late on Thursday.In the northeastern Kharkiv region where Ukrainian forces regained a large swathe of ground in September, the bodies of 534 civilians including 19 children were found after Russian troops left, Serhiy Bolvinov of the National Police in Kharkiv told a briefing posted online Thursday.The death toll from Thursday's alleged Russian attack in Zaporizhzhia city has risen to 11 people, according to Ukrainian officials who say civilians were among the dead.Meanwhile, Russian forces said yesterday they had captured ground in Donetsk in east Ukraine. Separatist forces had reclaimed a series of villages near the Ukraine-controlled industrial town of Bakhmut, which has been under Russian shelling for weeks.AFP journalists in the centre of Bakhmut heard the sound of heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems near the remains of a smashed bridge over the Bakhmutka river."

/daily-star-books/news/old-sins-cast-long-shadows-vivisection-communal-harmony-the-puja-ends-3138116,Old sins cast long shadows: a vivisection of communal harmony as the Puja ends,"The first step in attempting to solve anything is acknowledging that there is a problem.As we watched the Durga Puja of last year smear into carnage, celebrations turned into cries, it felt like a relief that this year the puja could be celebrated without any major incidents. And it was important to note that none of it was random acts of violence. Accepting that as a country and a culture we have a problem that goes far back, and is gaining power by the year, however hard, is the bare minimum we can do to start healing these wounds. Backtracking into a safe corner by claiming that 'this is not our country we see burning before us' shouldn't be an option, at least not at this point.There is a Nabarun Bhattacharya poem, ""Ei Mrittu Upottoka Amar Desh Na"", that gets shared a lot whenever things like that happen. I got tired of seeing that—all well-meaning people renouncing the version of the country they saw before them. I think it's been long enough, and there has been bloodshed enough. There has to be a reckoning and I am tired.And this death valley is my country,
this hangman's rhapsodic stage is my country,
this ample burning ground is my country,
this blood-soaked butcher's ground is my country.It's easier for me, and so privileged of me to say that I'm tired. I was after all born Muslim in a Muslim-majority country. In Arundhati Roy's The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, the first-person narrator, Biplab Dasgupta, the Brahmin high-ranking bureaucrat in the Indian government, says that they have trauma too because they have to look at it, they-the-rest-of-the-India, they have to see what they are doing. And while I am scribbling all this, there are concerns that I hope won't get debilitating. But there should be a true concern in writing about a tragedy whose target is not you. The concern is that it can become exploitative, voyeuristic and patronising.Which I hope it doesn't.
So here it goes. 
Firstly, we can't just wish things away, we can't disown parts of our culture and country because they don't fit our particular ideal. That is a cop-out, an easy way out, that is claiming we are pristine, and the dirt lives elsewhere, claiming we are saints and that is not our sin. That is our sin. The longer we deny that, the longer we claim that this is not our country, the stronger the threat will thrive in the corners. We can't map our country as we deem fit. Our own liberal bubbles are not the entire country. It is sickening to see the 'woke' people handing out sashes to each other in self-involved and self-indulgent posts on social media platforms sharing versions of their country where bigotry never existed. Even if one has lived a very sheltered life, it is expected that in their adult lives at some point they will rise above their own personal experiences and see the country as it is. It begs the question, why this collective denial? Is it to soothe ourselves to sleep, and to make our reality less harrowing and afflicting? Anyone who grew up in this country and culture, should not be so oblivious to the myriads of casual everyday hatred and sneers that are reserved for minority communities. Even before fully knowing the meaning of the words, children in homes, schools and playgrounds learn words like ""lal pipra"", ""malaun"" and so on. Even before knowing the full ramifications and implications, children learn rhymes that are so hateful that now as an adult, remembering them makes me nauseous. I was in an all-girls school, so I wasn't privy to all the colourful ways one's Hindu classmate can be dismissed and bullied. In our school, there are Hindu religion classes, so none of my Hindu classmates had to make a hurdle and sit in the corner while the Islam class carried on. It is crazy that I have to mention that. Because that is the absolute bare minimum a school can do. And I too knew the rhymes, I've heard it plenty.After the 2016 election and the win of Donald Trump, it was curiously observed by the African-American community and all the hyphenated citizens of the country how liberal America woke up to the fact that America is racist. Which is almost laughable considering how much oppression and police brutality is still going on. And they shouted, ""This is not America!""Liberal bubbles are quite alike throughout the world, they can hold that much cluelessness about the culture they live in. The Durga Puja incident of last year reminded me of the assault on a Muslim family in India on the suspicions that they had beef in their fridge.This is our country, and one day at a time she is being stripped of her colours, her vibrancies. She is being starved and forced to deny the rights of her children. If we ever talked to all our relatives, watched our classmates,  went back to our villages, we would know this ample burning ground is our country.The man who placed the Quran in the mandir knows the country. He and the men behind him knew exactly what the ripple effect of that would be. He knew how little push the people needed to wreak havoc on the people belonging to the other religion. While demanding the proper trial for the perpetrators, we should also be asking: why is it that we needed such a little push, an excuse almost to wreak havoc on our fellow Hindu citizens? Old sins cast long shadows. Old sins have lineage, history and heritage. Old sins are passed down from generation to generation. During the attacks and assaults, when, along with other names of the places of this country the name of 'Noakhali' came up, I was reminded of old sins. It was the place that burned in communal hatred during the Partition year. Hope can co-exist with acceptance. Fond memories can be remembered without delusions. And the hope is that there will be enough people too on the opposite spectrum of this. In homes enough fathers and mothers, and grandparents who do not just preach, but also show the children of the future how to coexist, and love and respect. In classes, enough teachers who don't separate, on playgrounds enough friends who have each others' backs, and who only recite rhymes of wonder and sweet mischief.Though I force myself to stay on the ground and not float off and romanticise the past, I do drift off. I drift off to childhood where my mother talks about her house tutor Kanon Devi, who comes very early in the morning and wakes her up calling her 'Dolly moni'. She wears sandalwood powder and I see the fondness in my mother's eyes saying that was the smell of her childhood mornings. Laying in bed, my five-year-old head hanging outside the bed, I could smell it too in the fleeting autumn lights. I remember the Puja time rush of my neighbourhoods, the whole of Mymensingh giddy in anticipation, a sense of festivity in everyone. The Saraswati pujas of my school and college, seeing the mandap and then going for khichuri to a friend's house. During Durga Puja the five-day marathon of proshad, para mishti, chana shondesh, lots of cha and maddening laughter.The reality is quite dire. But I hope it doesn't get debilitating. The things that we see now have always been there in our country, that shouldn't be news. What is changing and might reach a breaking point is how much of it is getting stronger, and has the balance been already tilted towards intolerance.""But hope is the thing with feathers,"" Emily Dickinson said. So with a feathery hope, I wish that Nabarun Bhattacharya's poem will, time and again, not be turned into fashion statements for easy cop-outs.  I hope we will not become Biplab Dasgupta and be delusional only to realise too late what had happened. What we let happen. But that, rather we'll be Guih Kyom, the dung beetle in Arundhati Roy's The Ministry of Utmost Happiness. The dung beetle who ""will turn the tide."" Sumaya Mashrufa is a human being who tries to be a human being.

But after months of tweetstorms and legal barbs, there are scars and suspicions on both sides.Experts say that behind the scenes, banks could be scrambling to find buyers for $12.5 billion in debt from the deal, and Musk is trying to hold together a group of equity investors that is pitching in billions more. The erratic billionaire is on the hook for the rest. The fighting continued Thursday, when Musk's attorneys said Twitter is refusing to accept his revived bid to buy the company. They sought to delay an upcoming trial on Twitter's lawsuit that could force him to complete the deal. But Twitter's attorneys said it's Musk who is holding everything up, and his effort to put the trial on hold ""is an invitation to further mischief and delay.""In the end, a judge agreed to give Musk more time to close the deal but said the trial will go ahead in November if he doesn't.It's still possible the sale could close. But with so much at play, here's what could throw the deal off track, again:A group of banks, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, signed on to loan $12.5 billion of the money Musk needs for the deal. In Thursday's court motion, Musk alleges that Twitter doesn't want to set the lawsuit aside because of a ""baseless"" fear that Musk could fail to get the bank financing. ""No such failure has occurred to date,"" the motion said. ""Counsel for the debt financing parties has advised that each of their clients is prepared to honor its obligations."" The banks are ""essentially cemented"" to the deal by solid contracts, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. But the debt market has changed dramatically since April. The stock market has tumbled, inflation is high, and interest rates are up as the Federal Reserve tries to slow the economy. Banks would sell the debt to institutional investors, but there's not much appetite now to take part in takeovers that saddle companies with big debts. Banks could be on the hook to make loans themselves. ""The banks would be really happy to not to have to take the risk of funding these loans,"" said Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan. ""The agreements seem to be very strong, but I think the banks have their lawyers pulling all-nighters trying to get them out of it if they can."" Investors who would get equity in Twitter are supposed to kick in billions. Ives estimates they had agreed to $15 billion to $16 billion. But some investors may be skittish about staying in given the market changes and Musk's repeated accusations against Twitter about the number of bots on the platform. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund declined comment this week on the $375 million its subsidiary pledged in May. Several other investors didn't respond to requests for comment on whether they were still chipping in. Musk's equity commitments — including $1 billion from Musk's friend and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison — are on shakier ground if any in that diverse group of backers have changed their minds, said Kevin Kaiser, an adjunct finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ""Nobody knows — I don't know anyway — what their commitment is,"" Kaiser said. ""So are they able to back out? Because if they're able to back out, he is on the hook.""Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $231 billion according to Forbes, has to kick in his own money, but just how much depends on how many equity investors stay in. Most of his wealth is tied up in stock of the electric car company that he runs, Tesla Inc. Since April, he has sold more than $15 billion worth of Tesla stock, presumably to pay his share. If any equity investors drop out, though, Musk will either have to replace them or throw in more money, fueling speculation that he might have to sell more Tesla shares. Musk's share of the original deal was about $15.5 billion, Ives estimated.It's clear that Twitter's board is very suspect of Musk because he has trashed the company for months now, alleging that it has far fewer daily users than it reports to investors, said Gordon. That has diminished Twitter's value and made investing in the deal less attractive, he says. And because Musk already tried to back out of the deal once, Twitter will want a guarantee of some sort that he won't back out again. That, Ives said, is likely to be a large chunk of money held in a non-refundable escrow account that would go to Twitter if Musk doesn't deliver. There are some signs that the deal will yet go through. Twitter says it looks forward to closing the deal by Oct. 28. Musk's deposition in the lawsuit, scheduled for Thursday in Austin, Texas, was postponed. Musk's motion says the bankers are still in. And the original group of investors is not talking publicly about bailing out."

A group of 41 climbing trainees and their teachers were caught in Tuesday's massive snowslide near the summit of Mount Draupadi ka Danda II in the northern state of Uttarakhand. ""We have retrieved 26 bodies so far -- 24 of them were trainees and two bodies are those of instructors,"" an official from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, a government agency, told AFP. Three members of the expedition remained missing, the official added, but bad weather forced an early end to Friday's search. Rescue operations will resume in the morning."

The Tigresses suffered a heavy 59-run defeat.    Chasing India's 160-run target, Bangladesh could only muster 100 for seven in 20 overs. Openers Fargana Hoque and Murshida Khatun stitched together a 45-run opening stand but took as many as 55 deliveries to do so, resulting in increasing the scoreboard pressure on the batters to follow who could never keep up with the required rate. Murshida departed in the 10th over after a 25-ball 21 while Fargana, who fell to a Deepti Sharma delivery in the 14th over, scored an uninspiring 40-ball 30. Skipper Nigar Sultana Joty tried to up the ante with her team-high 29-ball 36 but that never put any pressure on India. Other than the aforementioned three, no other batters were able to get to double-digit scores as Bangladesh suffered a heavy defeat. Earlier, a 44-ball 55 from opener Shafali Verma coupled with skipper Smriti Mandhana's 38-ball 47 and an unbeaten rapid 35-run knock from Jemimah Rodrigues saw India pile up 159 for five.        "

Before that, they had also trafficked many others, mainly to Middle Eastern countries, he added.Mohiuddin said the gang collected passports of 521 people through their brokers from different parts of Bangladesh in the last two years and took Tk 2-3 lakh for sending each of them to Middle Eastern countries and Tk 6-7 lakh for sending them to Europe.The gang members used to convince victims by showing them fake appointment letters and other documents of foreign companies, the official said.But, in the last two years, Mahbubul was not able to send anyone abroad and did not even submit passports to any travel agency to start the process, he said.The arrestees were planning to leave the country with the swindled money, said Mohiuddin.Rab officials said the gang earlier sent some people abroad promising high-paying jobs there. But instead of giving them jobs, the gang's foreign counterparts confined the job seekers and tortured them for ransom. "

/entertainment/music/news/artcellnama-everything-you-need-know-about-artcell-and-their-third-album-3136521,‘Artcellnama’: Everything you need to know about Artcell and their third album,"A band rose from Dhaka's underground scene to become a household name among the metal and prog rock fans of the country – Artcell.In spite of almost a decade of inactivity, the band continues to spread madness among the youth. Thousands of voices chanting ""Artcell, Artcell, Artcell!"" resonate in the concert halls to this day.In a conversation with The Daily Star, the band opens up about their recent activities, and their concert experiences over the decades.The third Artcell album
Ever since the band came back to doing stage shows after their long hiatus, fans have been raving about their third album. The impatient, avid fans, have urged the band to stop with the 'high school drama' and give them new music. So, when is the album really coming out?



Artcell's drummer, Kazi Asheqeen Shaju, shared that they are done recording this much anticipated album. The mix-mastering is in progress right now.
""If everything goes to plan, we will launch the album this year, by the end of December,"" he said.
Ershad's participation in third album



Some of the fans might have expected guitarist Ershad Zaman's involvement in the third album, but the band clarified that he was officially, and legally, no longer a member of the band. Besides, he has been irregular at the practice sessions and recordings, since 2008.
Suffice to say that he does not have any kind of input in their upcoming album. However, he does have access to some commercial benefits from the record label for the songs he penned down in the past albums.
 








Their return
Beyond all odds, Artcell has made its way back on the stage. The band is now quite regular at gigs after their drummer, Shaju, has returned from abroad.
But what was it that brought them back?
According to the vocalist, George Lincoln D'Costa, their love for music and mutual respect for the band is what reunited them. Shaju believes it is the fans and their unbridled support that helped the band realise that they needed to get back into the music scene.
He said, ""The tremendous support and the covers we saw online were receiving a lot of traction. And we always received a great number of tags and mentions on our social media platforms every day. This gave us the spirit to come back together. We knew people remembers us.""
""It's amazing how these fans kept the band alive,"" Shaju added.
 








Gig plans
Artcell is now more selective about their gigs. They do not want to perform at too many gigs every month, and are careful about performing in an impactful manner.
However, the band does plan to arrange gigs in a couple of districts across the country, as well as abroad, soon after the launch of their third album.
 








Artcell's first concert
The year was 1999, and it was the ICMA auditorium in the capital's Katabon area. This used to be an underground venue back in the days.
""I was very nervous. It was only three months since I started learning drums, and we had just begun practising together,"" Shaju shares.
Shaju had brought his own local 'Tama pedals'— the double bass drum that was provided in the venue was too rough to kick. The concert was nerve-racking for them. They covered numbers such as Sepultura's ""Propaganda"" and ""Beneath the Remains"". By the end of their performance, his pedals broke apart.
Memorable Concerts
According to Shaju, Artcell's most memorable concerts would be three – the band's first solo concert in 2002, the 10th anniversary celebration concert, and the 20th anniversary celebration concert.
He said, ""Our first solo concert in 2002 at the Russian Culture Centre (RCC), arranged by Alter Metal forum, was a hell of an experience.""
Though this venue had a capacity of 300 people, over a thousand fans gathered there, and many were standing on the street, unable to be accommodated inside.  
""That was the first time we realised how crazy of a fan base we have. It was the beginning of witnessing the madness that people have for Artcell.""
Shaju added that having legendary musicians of the country, such as Maqsoodul Haque, Labu Rahman, Hamin Ahmed, Ibrahim Ahmed Kamal, Bassbaba, Shakib Chowdhury, Romel Ali and many more, at their 10th and 20th anniversary celebration concerts, have been an incomparable experience.  
 








Concert audiences
According to Lincoln, he noticed the ways their audience have gotten smarter. According to him, the fans who truly understood their songs and message, were more important than the crazy fans.
Shaju shares how there used to be a crowd who would chant and urge Artcell to get on the stage amidst other bands. This was disrespectful for the other performers.
""But it's a whole new crowd now. They are young, and a little toned down. But they still sing along with us and give us support. That still remains the same"" added Shaju with a pleasant smile.

It is close to home, we will be very comfortable on our bus,"" Galtier told PSG TV ahead of the visit to Reims for a Ligue 1 game on Saturday evening.Last season, PSG went to Reims, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the capital, by plane.On September 5, Galtier was asked why PSG had flown to Nantes which is 380km west of Paris but located on a high-speed train line.The side -- owned by an investment fund of major gas producer Qatar -- boasted on social media after the game that they had made the round trip with shirt sponsors Qatar Airways.Asked whether the club was taking its carbon footprint seriously, Galtier replied with sarcasm.""We had a chat with our travel organisers earlier to see if we can travel by sand-yacht,"" he said, referring to sail-powered buggies that are popular on some French beaches.He later pleaded ""misplaced humour"" but insisted that he was personally ""very conscientious"" personally to favoured trains over planes when travelling."
