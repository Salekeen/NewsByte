/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/probe-the-case-again-3131326,"A Dhaka court has found flaws in the charge sheet submitted by the Department of Narcotics Control in a case filed over the recovery of around 39,000 yaba pills from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in 2020.Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Tamanna Farah yesterday ordered the director general of the DNC to initiate further investigation into the case by an official not below the rank of deputy director. The magistrate added that the investigator of the case did not conduct the probe properly.Investigation Officer Masudur Rahman dropped the names of eight accused, who confessed to smuggling yaba pills, from the charge sheet submitted to the court on August 8 this year, the magistrate said in her order.""There is no scope to drop names of people who have given confessional statements before magistrates about their involvement in the incident,"" said the magistrate's order.Masudur Rahman, an inspector of the DNC, pressed charges against six people in the case.Before submitting the charge sheet, Masudur Rahman took opinions from a Dhaka Metropolitan public prosecutor.Masudur told The Daily Star, ""I dropped the names of the eight accused from the charge sheet based on the opinions of the PP.""During the investigation, I did not find their involvement in the case even though they confessed to the magistrates,"" the investigator said.The Daily Star could not reach the PP for comment as his phone was switched off.The investigator was also asked by the court on August 8 why he dropped the names of the eight.The investigator yesterday submitted a written explanation before the court, said a general recording official of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court of Dhaka.On October 16, 2020, DNC recovered 38,887 yaba pills at the airport in the capital and arrested Abu Shamim and Firoz Ahmed in connection with the recovery.Later, a case was filed under the Narcotics Control Act with Airport Police Station.DNC also arrested 10 more people for their alleged involvement in smuggling the yaba pills.All 12 accused, now on bail, made confessional statements before magistrates on different dates.Among the accused, Hasmat Ali Prince and Rafiqul Islam, a Saudi expatriate, were also shown as fugitives in the charge sheet.On April 24, Younus Miah Prokash Liton, the mastermind behind the yaba smuggling, was arrested in the capital's Kadamtoli.Md Asadullah, another accused, told the court that Liton and Prince kept those yaba in three cartons to send to Saudi Arabia where expatriate Rafiqul Islam will receive those, said the case documents.Moreover, Liton confessed to the magistrate that he along with Prince, Rafiq and Md Sharif were smuggling yaba for a long time."

/news/bangladesh/news/loadshedding-the-relief-assured-yet-materialise-3131366,"The government's assurance of relief from power cuts within September is likely to fall flat as people in the capital and elsewhere continue to suffer frequent loadshedding in sweltering heat.Moreover, the power cuts have been occurring around midnight over the last one week even though the daily schedules released by the utility companies make no mention of loadshedding after 11:00pm.Though the situation is unlikely to improve unless the temperature drops, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) is set to increase electricity prices by October 13.During a public hearing on May 18, BERC officials recommended raising bulk electricity prices by 57.8 percent.Contacted, energy expert Prof M Tamim said the promises of relief from power cuts were based on the assumption that the temperature would drop around this time of year and there would be less demand for electricity.""The government might have also hoped the transmission line from Payra Power Plant would be completed by September. But that has not happened either,"" he said.The Buet professor said the power outages around midnight are likely to be an effort by the BPDB to save on fuel.During peak hours in September, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) supplied 12,000-12,500MW of electricity, falling 2,000-2,500MW short of the total demand.On Wednesday, there were shortages of 1,471 MW in urban areas and 1,606 MW in rural areas, making hundreds of thousands of people across the country endure hours of power outage.According to the BPDB data, the gap between supply and demand was similar in July, when officials announced that power failures would happen every day.Hamidur Rahman, a resident of Badda in the capital, said his four-year-old was having trouble sleeping because of the midnight power outages.""For the last three days, there has been no electricity for 30-40 minutes around midnight. I don't understand why this happens at an hour when the offices and factories are closed,"" said the employee of a private firm.""And now I will have to pay more for this terrible service. It is not justifiable by any means.""BPDB spokesperson Shameem Hasan said the exacerbating power cuts were happening partly because the ""abnormally hot weather last week"" resulted in more demand for electricity to run the air conditioners.According to the daily outage forecast released by the Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) and Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited, the residents of the capital have been enduring outages for 2-3 hours.But people from different areas of the city report that the reality was much worse than the forecast.DPDC Managing Director Bikash Dewan said that over the last week, they faced shortages of 300-400MW in peak hours every day.Asked about the discrepancies between the forecast and the actual outages, DESCO MD Kausar Ameer Ali said the schedule would be changed soon.Kausar said a BPDB official told him that gas shortage was one of the reasons why electricity generation couldn't be increased.According to Petrobangla data, about 470 million cubic feet of imported liquified natural gas (LNG) was supplied to the national gas grid on Wednesday. The amount was 540 mmcfd on average in August.A Petrobangla official told The Daily Star that the LNG supply will remain 470mmcfd -500mmcfd until the government starts buying LNG from the spot market again.Petrobangla Chairman Nazmul Ahsan earlier told reporters that Qatar had not accepted Bangladesh's request to increase LNG supply immediately.On July 7, Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, energy adviser to the prime minister, told reporters that there would be some relief from loadshedding within September because three new coal-based power plants would begin operation by then.But the reality is, none of the said power plants has started operation."
/news/asia/china/news/fish-fossils-offer-clues-human-evolution-3131401,"Fish fossils dating back 440 million years are helping to ""fill some of the key gaps"" on how humans evolved from fish, researchers said on Wednesday.Two fossil deposits of ancient fish in Guizhou, southern China, and Chongqing in the southwest were discovered by scientists during a field study in 2019.The fossils ""help to trace many human body structures back to ancient fishes, some 440 million years ago, and fill some key gaps in the evolution of 'from fish to human,'"" researchers from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences said.Their findings, which they said ""provide further iron evidence to the evolutionary path"", were published in four papers in the journal Nature on Wednesday.The Chongqing fossil deposit includes a fish -- known as acanthodians -- with bony armour around its fins and is considered the ancestor of creatures with jaws and a backbone, including humans.Scientists in 2013 said they had found a 419-million-year-old fish fossil in China that disproved the long-held theory that modern animals with bony skeletons (osteichthyans) evolved from a shark-like creature with a frame made of cartilage.The newly discovered creature, dubbed Fanjingshania, predates this ancient fish fossil by about 15 million years, the study said.""This is the oldest jawed fish with known anatomy,"" lead researcher Zhu Min said.""The new data allowed us to... gain much needed information about the evolutionary steps leading to the origin of important vertebrate adaptations such as jaws, sensory systems, and paired appendages (limbs).""The Chongqing fossils are also the world's only fossils dating back nearly 440 million years which ""preserves complete, head-to-tail jawed fishes"", offering a rare peek into a time period regarded as the ""dawn of fishes"", the statement said.""It's really an awesome, game-changing set of fossil discoveries,"" said John Long, the former president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology who is currently with Australia's Flinders University.""It rewrites almost everything we know about the early history of jawed animal evolution."""

/business/economy/news/3000-tonnes-hilsa-being-exported-india-3131626,"Bangladesh will export around 3,000 tonnes of hilsa to India marking upcoming Durga Puja, the biggest religious festival of the Hindu community scheduled to be held next month. ""We have been exporting hilsa continuously for the last three years to India as a goodwill gesture 15-20 days ahead of the Durga Puja festival,"" said Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi.A total of 60 private companies – each to export a maximum of 50 tonnes - got approval from the commerce ministry.The ministry, however, in its latest order has extended the export timeframe till October 5 instead of the previously scheduled timeframe of September 30 as the government has imposed a 22-day hilsa fishing ban which will start from October 7.As per the order, the export permits cannot be transferred to other companies nor is any kind of subcontracting allowed. Only authorised organisations will be able to export the hilsa.Last year, the commerce ministry gave approval to 115 firms to export 4,600 tonnes of hilsa to India against applications from around 200 companies. But only 1,100 tonnes were ultimately exported.Some 1,450 tonnes were exported to India in 2020 and 18 firms received permission in the year. In 2019, only one trader got the permission and it exported 500 tonnes of the fish.According to the export policy order, the export of hilsa from Bangladesh is banned. However, every year before Durga Puja, a large number of exporters of the country apply to the Ministry of Commerce for permission to send hilsa to India.After halting the hilsa export to India for seven years, the ministry allowed a certain amount of hilsa exports to India conditionally before the Durga Puja in 2019.However, the government stopped the export in 2012 after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee opposed the Teesta water-sharing agreement.In 2015, when Mamata Banerjee visited Bangladesh and requested Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to export hilsa to India, the latter replied, ""Hilsa will go if Teesta water comes.""Later in 2019, the government resumed the hilsa export to its neighbour. "

/business/economy/news/do-more-keep-financial-inclusion-momentum-going-3131596,"Bangladesh should do more to keep up its momentum in the area of financial inclusion, expand access and bridge the gender gaps that persist, said a top official of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  While giving her opening remarks at a virtual discussion on ""Fintech and Financial Inclusion and the Case of Bangladesh: Peer-Learning Series"" on Wednesday, IMF Deputy Managing Director Antoinette M Sayeh said in Bangladesh, financial inclusion has been a decades-long journey to include segments of the population that previously had limited access to formal finance.""This journey, which first began with microcredit, has since evolved to cover all aspects of financial inclusion—from access, to usage, and to quality,"" she said.Today, the use of mobile phones for financial transactions is commonplace in Bangladesh. People are accustomed to digital financial services, agent banking, branchless banking, and mobile money.""Government policies have enabled small and medium-sized enterprises and supported women entrepreneurs. And benefits have accrued not just to those in urban areas; the agricultural and rural sectors have also advanced thanks to policies, such as floors on credit, which are backed by refinancing lines on concessional terms.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist.""""Of course, more work needs to be done to maintain this momentum, to expand access even more and to bridge the gender gaps that persist,"" said Sayeh.The IMF senior official commended Bangladesh for the rich policy tapestry laid out in its latest financial inclusion strategy, which covers important aspects such as credit growth in priority sectors, MSME financing, gender priority, access to finance in rural areas, and green financing.She also acknowledged that Bangladesh has invested significantly in digital infrastructure and many new companies have emerged, building on that infrastructure.""Continued emphasis in areas such as credit bureaus, asset registration, payment systems, and micro-finance institutions will further reduce the cost of financial services. For achieving some of these, collaborating with the private sector will be important but striking the right balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring financial stability remains vital.""Sayeh said financial inclusion is a topic that is becoming an essential ingredient to building a modern and resilient economy.She recognised the huge strides Asia-Pacific economies have made in digitalisation which is pervasive and growing in the region. ""Indeed, it stands out by its sheer scale, with internet usage far exceeding numbers in other regions and underpinning widespread e-commerce and fintech.""And yet, she said, gaps in financial inclusion remain large—both within and across countries in Asia and the Pacific.IMF research shows that close to half of the adult population in low- and middle-income economies in the region still do not have a bank account. Less than 10 per cent of them are able to borrow from formal financial institutions.Small and medium enterprises, as well as farmers, face limited access to credit. They often rely on informal markets for finance, where costs are high—leaving poor households vulnerable to shocks and poverty traps.Within countries, too, there are gaps between the rich and poor, and between urban and rural areas. There is also work to be done on policies around consumer protection, supervisory capacity, enforcing privacy laws and providing inclusive insurance,"" said Sayeh.She reinforced the criticality of financial inclusion as a macroeconomic priority.""It is not just the right thing to do. Indeed, from a policy standpoint, it has the potential to reduce inequality and transform economic growth.""""Especially at a time when public coffers are running low and governments need to do more with limited fiscal space, financial inclusion—and with it, the expansion of the formal financial sector—can greatly improve the effectiveness of public financial management and enhance central banks' ability to stabilise economic activity. And here fintech can play a critical role.""In his presentation, Habibur Rahman, chief economist of the Bangladesh Bank, said the central bank is fostering a stable financial system.""The BB is widening the coverage of financial inclusion through agent banking, reducing gender gap through the inclusion of unbanked women, and developing strategies to reach underprivileged people and increase usage of financial services.""Over the last decade, the availability of financial services points increased significantly in terms of both access to bank branches and automated teller machines (ATMs). The number of ATMs has jumped sharply.There has been rapid growth in the use of mobile financial services, said Rahman.Speaking about the challenges ahead, the chief economist said leveraging fintech, the central bank is contemplating making policies on nano-loan, digital lending, agro-tech, supply chain finance, crowd-funding and person-to-person lending.""Digital financial services rapidly expand financial access but also pose significant risks related to fraud, market abuses, consumer protection and financial stability. Efforts should continue to improve fintech-related financial literacy.""Similarly, the rapid evolution of fintech demands a similar pace of regulatory and supervisory technology development in the context of regulatory compliance, risk mitigation and consumer protection, he said.Tao Wu, senior economist of the Institute for Capacity Development of the IMF, also made a presentation. Alfred Schipke, director of the IMF–Singapore Regional Training Institute, Chang Yong Rhee, governor of the Bank of Korea, Patrick Njoroge, governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, Abdur Rouf Talukder, governor of the Bangladesh Bank, Kamal Quadir, chief executive officer of bKash, Nazneen Ahmed, country economist of the United Nations Development Programme, and Rahul Anand, division chief of the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF, also spoke."

I know I was, yet, this Himu's story stands a tad different.Himu, the real-life person that the play is based on, was an animal lover and one of the volunteers who rushed to scene of the Rana Plaza collapsed, back in April 24, 2013. Over the course of two weeks, Himu rescued countless people and helped extract their dead bodies from the ruins.At times, he was forced to chop off their limbs and flesh to get them out. Himu spent days in the rubble of concrete, layered with decaying bodies. He would continue to help by treating and rehabilitating victims at the hospital for the next 17 days.Unfortunately, his good deeds stayed with him in the form of the psychological trauma that evinced his daily life. Himu was not the only one haunted by the souls of the victims he failed to save. The audience sat enchanted, watching Himu begging those he could not save to stop coming back to him, all the while screaming for the luxury of sleeping without nightmares.Troubled by the way the society around us operates, the incidence of crimes and wrongs are enough to send anyone spiraling, and Himu is no different. He spends his days detached from family and friends, planning to build an animal shelter where he'd stay with Julie—his faithful dog with whom he spent most of his days with.Eventually, Himu was dirven to set himself on fire, on the sixth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy. The words of his fictitious diary thought out loud, contemplating who Himu really was.""I met Himu and his free thoughts first at the Gonojagoron Mancha. In some random conversations, I got a chance to look into the mind of a dreamer who had his way with words,"" said Sanjoy Sarker Muktonil, the writer and director of the play. ""I don't know how well I was able to articulate his thoughts, but when Himu's mother came to watch the show and said she was finally able to see her son's thoughts, I felt at peace.""There is no happy ending to this play. Looking into the struggles of Himu to continue with life, is not a tribute to him either. This is but an attempt to understand what happened and fill the silence of what Himu thought and said. Baatighar Theatre's ""Himur Kolpito Diary"" was performed on Tuesday evening in the Studio Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy."
/tech-startup/news/the-grim-freelancing-reality-3131421,"Not too long ago, freelancing was deemed an exciting career prospect for thousands of skilled Bangladeshi youths. The rapid digitalisation of the country, combined with a rising number of skilled, educated, but unemployed workforce—and consistently low market wages—contributed to a freelancing boom in Bangladesh over the last decade. Statistics paint a happy picture too. The Bangladesh Freelancing Development Society (BFDS) sources state that there are at least 10,50,000 active freelancers in the country, although unofficial numbers put that figure at a much higher estimate. According to a Payoneer study, Bangladesh was also the 8th largest exporter of online labour in 2019 and consistently ranks as one of the top countries preferred by employers. But despite the conditions working out to their apparent advantage, freelancers in Bangladesh still remain one of the least supported communities. Lack of appropriate payment gateways, struggles in availing seamless banking services, and the general lack of recognition—all add up to a freelancer's woes. Now with the global energy crisis and supply shortage, the reality on the ground is grimmer than ever before.Based out of Khulna, Sudiptta Apu is a successful freelancer who was recently featured in Upwork's 2022 spotlight—a segment that highlights the story and profile of Upwork's top-rated professionals. For Sudiptta, being featured and highlighted in one of the world's top freelance marketplaces was a huge honour. It was a testament to his professionalism, skill and record. But despite such accolades, Sudiptta, who is a designer by profession, shares what it is actually like being a freelancer in Bangladesh. ""I had to muster up a lot of courage when I first decided to quit my job and start freelancing full-time. Because I knew it would not be easy. I knew very few would accept it as a recognised and respectable career path,"" he shared. Sudiptta shared how banking services seem to discriminate against freelancers who are not usually able to show a traditional income source. ""It is a painstaking process to open a bank account when you are a freelancer and they ask you to show proof of income,"" he shares.""As freelancers, we are remittance-earners. The government deducts taxes when we receive our income. Why is it that we are not recognised properly?""He says that despite several promises, the government has failed to bring services like PayPal in the country, making it difficult for Bangladeshi freelancers to compete freely in the global market. And he shared how the recent power outages cut into the working hours, making it difficult for local freelancers to communicate with their clients abroad on time.""Our clients who are abroad often fail to understand that we are facing troubles because we have no power. Often we cannot communicate on time, or submit projects on time. This brings down our image and lessens our chances of getting more work because the client will just give the work to someone who is more efficient and timely,"" he shares. ""Often, I have to work overtime to make up for the lost hours. And no one prefers working overtime.""For others, like Sourav Sarker of Chandpur who works primarily with digital marketing, the outages ate into the hourly wages. ""If I cannot bid on a project on time, I do not get that project. It is usually that simple,"" shares Sourav. ""I have also had cases where the scheduled power outage of one hour went on to last for three hours and I could not submit my project on time. The client ultimately gave me a bad rating and it definitely affected my profile.""Sourav mentioned how freelancers from remote villages of India had better prospects than their counterparts in Bangladesh because they had access to better resources and scopes of training. ""They get to learn a lot. They have an organised community. They have scopes of training and many of them get offered permanent relocation options in places like Silicon Valley. Although we are doing good, we can barely even dream of such things,"" he says.When asked if he is part of any freelancer's organisation, Sourav says that he is not. He also mentioned that he knows many freelancers who work out of a rural setting and that nobody ever tried to reach out to them with support.""We hear of many things from time to time—like government-issued ID cards, or special provisions and training etc. But in reality, I don't think I know many freelancers who have ever been supported by these government-led programmes,"" he shares. ""I am not even sure if they exist in reality.""When contacted, Dr Tanjiba Rahman, the current Chairman of BFDS, mentioned that the ID card project is running in full swing with 7000 ID cards already distributed and nearly 50,000 applicants currently awaiting their turn. Freelancers in Bangladesh are thriving despite their struggles and the many obstacles that hold them back. The current energy shortage only worsens that crisis and opens up a new floodgate of obstacles. But the future remains hopeful as more youths—particularly those who are in rural or marginal areas of the country—take up freelancing as a source of stable income, paving their own paths to success. Nonetheless, a lot remains to be done. One can only hope that the government and the concerned authorities will do everything necessary for the sector to prosper. "

Bangladesh is working on different e-government initiatives to improve efficiency and capacity in public services delivery.The report said Bangladesh has shown tremendous growth in terms of digital financial account access through the proliferation of branchless banking, which has taken full-service retail banking to the doorsteps of rural citizens across the country, and soaring mobile financial services (MFS), which have reached a client base of over 100 million.Combining these channels, and in collaboration with the Ministries of Social Welfare, Finance, and Bangladesh Bank, the a2i Programme of the Government of Bangladesh, with support from UNDP, the Gates Foundation and the Consultative Group to assist the poor, developed the ""Citizen's Choice Architecture"" for digital payments of social safety net programs-such as elderly allowance, allowance for widowed, deserted, and destitute women, allowance for financially-insolvent disabled people.In Bangladesh, communication and collaboration are facilitated at the country, municipal, and rural local government levels through e-participation tools available on the national portal.

/news/bangladesh/rights/news/national-girl-child-day-no-country-our-daughters-3131581,"Although Sustainable Development Goals target ending abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against children by 2030, Bangladesh is yet to go a long way in this regard.The reality is even worse for girl children. The latest report found that a total of 574 girl children were subjected to rape in the first eight months of this year, of whom, 84 were victims of gang rape and 43 were children with disabilitiesAnother 87 girl children faced attempt to rape, said the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum (NGCAF) report.Twenty of the children were killed after rape, it mentioned.The report will be officially launched today.NGCAF prepared the ""Girl Children Situation Monitoring Report 2022"", based on reports from 24 daily newspapers, in 13 categories from January to August.The analysis also revealed that even one-year-old infants have also been victims of rape.Although some perpetrators were arrested following the GDs and cases filed after many such incidents, most of them were released on bail later.Moreover, they also threatened the victims and their parents with dire consequences.The report did not find any information on final punitive actions taken against the perpetrators in any such case, though a High Court directive suggests the disposal of rape or murder cases within 180 days of filing them with Women and Children Repression Prevention Tribunals.With such a reality, Bangladesh is celebrating National Girl Child Day today, with the slogan ""Somoyer Ongikar: Konyashishur Odhikar"" (Rights of girl children: a timely pledge).The report also found that 76 girls were subjected to sexual harassment and torture from January to August 2021, of whom, one was a child with disabilities and 15 were subjected to pornography.Most of the occurrences took place in public places, including markets, streets, public transport, educational and religious institutions and in the confines of their own home, by family members, relatives, teachers and stalkers.A total of 186 girls were also killed in this period, followed by rape, sexual harassment and family feud, while another 181 girls died by suicide, compared to the 153 in 2021.During this period, three girl children were subjected to acid attacks due to family feud and rejection of affair proposals, while another 136 was subjected to trafficking and abduction.Since the incidents of child marriage are not widely reported in the media, the forum received the data from its partners working in the field.According to the data, a total of 1,669 girls from 25 districts became the victims of child marriage in the first eight months, while 589 incidents of child marriage were stopped with the help of local administration.Thirteen girl children also faced dowry-related domestic violence during this period, while five were killed.On the other hand, a total of 15 girls who worked as domestic help were tortured in the first eight months of 2022, of whom two were killed after the torture, while one died by suicide.Focus group discussions with girl children at the field level revealed that about 1,000 girl children are being regular victims of cyber harassment, including inappropriate messages, distorted images, sexual innuendos and much more.However, an overwhelming majority of the girl children did not complain against those, as they did not know where to go to seek remedies. Others refused to pursue a legal battle, considering further threats and inconveniences.The forum recommended completing judicial proceedings as soon as possible with special emphasis on child abuse, rape and murder, and enacting a separate ""Sexual Harassment Prevention and Remedy Act"".It also recommended that the burden of proof in cases related to rape and attempts to rape must be shifted to the perpetrators, by amending the existing laws, along with stopping political and administrative shelter for perpetrators, and establishing a separate department for protecting child rights.The recommendations also included providing gender-sensitive training to all those involved in the legal and judicial system and ensuring proper implementation of the existing laws."

/tech-startup/news/toyota-axio-or-honda-grace-which-one-should-you-go-3131396,"If you have a budget of Tk. 20-22 lakh and planning to buy a mid-sized daily driver sedan to get around the city, you either have to seek the second-hand market for old Premallions, which is always a gamble to buy or you could play a bit safer and get your hands on reconditioned vehicles such as the Toyota Axio or Honda Grace. These old reliables are among the most popular cars even today, getting more and more common around Dhaka city and cementing themselves as the top choice among the budget-oriented reconditioned markets. However, with the same price range and so many similar features, which do you go for? Toyota Axio or Honda Grace? Here are some key differences to consider.First and foremost, both are fantastic choices for sedans. The local consumers tend to be biased toward Toyotas, owing to consistently high resale values and the city mechanics being familiar with Toyota cars' ins and outs. On the other hand, Honda offers Grace in the same price range - making it a worthy contender owing to most features being similar, with some being arguably better. Since Honda in general has become more common on Dhaka roads over the past couple of years, mechanics are also extending their arsenal towards fixing Honda vehicles. Within the next few years, you can expect that fixing your Grace will be as smooth as fixing any other car in this country.To keep this comparison as parallel as possible, we are going to compare the new shaped Axio (2015 and later facelift model) with the 2014-2015 models of Grace. These are both midsize sedans with an FF layout - both come as a hybrid and only the Axio comes with a petrol-only option. Both the Honda Grace and the Toyota Axio have an optional AWD and, in terms of engine size, both have a 1.5L four-cylinder engine. Toyota uses its infamous VVT-I technology and Honda uses its Variable valve timing and lift technology, which is also known as VTEC. While these cars seem to be very similar, these are just the basic specs. You will see later that these vehicles are quite different and distinct from each other.When it comes to looks, the Grace looks a bit more bold and well thought out. The exterior is a bit larger than the Axio and overall looks more ""mature"", whereas the Axio is a bit smaller compared to the Grace and looks a bit more sporty and agile. The rear end of the Axio is a difficult design to judge, as the trunk does not sit flush with the bumper and taillights, thus looking like something is missing. The rear end of the Grace, on the other hand, is put through nicely and everything is flush and nothing sticks out like a sore thumb. Of course, subjective interpretations aside, both the vehicles are excellently designed and at the end of the day, everything, especially the design, narrows down to personal choice.Since both of these cars are meant for daily driving, the interior space is equally important for the driver and the passengers riding in it. The Axio has slimmer, more open fabric seats compared to the Grace where the seats, still fabric, are bigger and have larger bolsters which provide better support when taking turns. Both the Axio and Grace have leather steering wheel options and an analogue speedometer with an additional display to show miscellaneous information about the vehicle. The infotainment system in both cars is basic and provides necessary features such as Bluetooth pairing for hands-free calling and music. Both cars also come with backup cameras. Overall, the features and materials are nice and neither company skimped on the interior.Both cars come with 1.5-litre engines as standard with a CVT gearbox. However, if you look hard enough, you can sometimes spot 5-speed manual Axios out in the wild as well - models extremely rare in this country and very hard to come by. The petrol models come with a 1 NZ engine which is honestly no surprise at this point, packing 109 hp and 138 Nm of torque and the hybrid version, unfortunately, loses additional power, having the same engine, where it narrows down to 74 hp and 111 Nm of torque.  The Grace, on the other hand, comes with a hybrid-only L series engine with the Honda Earth Dreams hybrid technology paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission - packing more power than the Axio, averaging 110 hp and 132 Nm of torque. Fuel consumption is comparatively low as these are hybrid vehicles, where the Axio averages at 20-22 km/l in the city and 26-28 km/l on highways. The Grace averages 18-20 km/l in the city and 20-22 km/l on highways.Overall both of the vehicles offer good options for the price they have been set for but, when push comes to shove, it all depends on personal choice and what you are looking for. Toyota offers superb resale value and a slightly better fuel economy but Honda is providing better materials and driving experience and most experienced users would agree that the Honda Grace is subjectively a better-looking car than the Axio. In the end, judge the features (and the looks) yourself and go with what your heart decides. You honestly can't go wrong with either."
/business/economy/news/bb-hikes-key-interest-rate-25-basis-points-3131631,"The Bangladesh Bank yesterday raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent as it stepped up its fight against inflation, which is running at a multi-year high.  This was the third hike since May 29, an unprecedented move on the part of the BB as it has never revised the rate upwards multiple times in such a short time.The move is in line with the efforts of central banks around the globe as they are desperately trying to curb inflationary pressures amid supply chain disruption, driven by the Russia-Ukraine war.For example, the Federal Reserve of the US, the central bank of the US, hiked interest rates in September for the fifth consecutive time. Similarly, the European Central Bank raised interest rates in July and September.The UK raised the rate recently, while India's central bank is expected to increase its policy rate by half a point for the third time in a row.But it remains to be seen whether the BB's intervention, which is meant to be making funds costlier for borrowers, would be able to contain inflation since loans are relatively cheaper in Bangladesh at the moment owing to a ceiling on interest rates.The central bank has maintained the lending interest rate cap of 9 per cent since April 2020.Usually, central banks raise interest rates to curb accelerating inflation and safeguard price stability.A higher interest rate pushes up the lower limit for lending rates to firms and households, disincentivising their consumption and investment. In turn, this reduces aggregate demand in the economy, thus lowering inflationary pressures, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB).The policy rate, which is termed the repurchase agreement (repo) in Bangladesh, is a pivotal benchmark interest rate that commercial banks follow in fixing the interest rates on both loans and deposits.Quoting the rate, cash-strapped banks take short-term loans from the BB and disburse them among borrowers.Md Habibur Rahman, chief economist of the BB, says that inflation may go up further in the days to come, prompting the central bank to raise the policy rate once again.In July, inflation fell to 7.48 per cent from a nine-year high of 7.56 per cent in June. The government has not published the figure for August.In addition, the private sector credit growth is now on the increase, an indication of the upward trend of the money supply.Private sector credit growth surged to 14.07 per cent in August, almost touching the central bank's target for the entire fiscal year of 14.1 per cent.The rising private sector credit growth means the central bank's monetary policy stance is not bringing about desired outcomes. ""The policy rate hike means the central bank is now stricter in reducing the supply of money than before,"" said Rahman.Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said the demand for loans would not go down until the interest cap on loans is withdrawn.""If interest rate cap is lifted, lending will decrease across the board and this will ultimately squeeze the money supply.""The economist said money supply from the central bank through the repo platform will not face any major barrier as banks will continue to lend to businesses at the current pace.""So, the latest central bank initiative will not help the economy contain inflation,"" he said, adding that cash-strapped banks will, however, see their profit decline.A number of BB officials, on the condition of anonymity, said that the withdrawal of the lending rate cap was discussed at a BB meeting yesterday.""But it is not possible for the central bank to take any move to this end since the cap is being implemented at the instruction of the government,"" said one of them.A managing director of a bank alleged that a group of influential borrowers is compelling both the government and the central bank to follow the cap so as to borrow at cheaper rates.Selim Raihan, executive director of the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, said that revising the policy rate upward would not help arrest inflation.""If the central bank can't withdraw the cap, it should at least relax the ceiling in the interest of the economy.""Monzur Hossain, research director of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, thinks raising the policy rate may slow down the private sector credit growth, but says it will not bring any major positive impact when it comes to fighting inflation.""Now is the time to consider withdrawing the lending interest cap.""Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, says banks will be in a disadvantaged situation as their cost of borrowing from the central bank would go up. ""But the private sector credit growth is not likely to dip.""Another BB official says if the interest rate ceiling is scrapped, the money supply will decrease, which will subsequently reduce the demand for goods and services.""This will help curb imports.""Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves have been hit hard by the escalation of import payments.The reserves stood at $36.44 billion yesterday in contrast to $46.28 billion a year ago.According to the ADB, many central banks in the region have already raised policy rates, but it is likely that more tightening will be needed.For now, real interest rates are low or even negative in much of the region, despite rising inflation expectations.Going forward, the Manila-based lender said, central banks facing persistent pressures of currency depreciation may opt for a more aggressive hiking cycle, as well as the careful implementation of appropriate capital flow management policies to deal with potentially destabilising and unwanted capital outflows.The taka has lost its value by about 25 per cent against the US dollar in the past one year amid shortages of the American greenback. "
/business/economy/news/does-bangladesh-need-5g-now-3131591,"During a rural market visit a few years ago, I discovered, to my amusement, a keen interest in 5G penetration among the villagers. When I asked why they need 5G at all, as most did not have a smartphone, their shy excuses said it all. And why not, I urged them. There is nothing wrong with dreaming high.Bangladesh is growing fast with making ""Vision 2041"" a reality. The Perspective Plan of Bangladesh aims to reach the status of upper middle-income country by 2031 and high-income status by 2041. The internet and digital technology are going to be the key tools in implementing the plan.Digital inclusion is a crucial component of this journey with access to reliable and affordable connectivity being essential to the government's aspiration towards its ""Vision 2041"".The reach of mobile networks has galloped with over 95 per cent of the population covered by 4G mobile broadband networks. Despite massive investments in the sector with its rapid expansion of 4G coverage, there is still a significant usage gap of 67 per cent.Interestingly, of the remaining 33 per cent, only 28 per cent subscribed to a mobile internet service in 2020. The lag between 4G coverage and the share of 4G connections only goes to emphasise that demand does not automatically follow supply.Let's understand what 5G has to offer. 5G is designed to do a variety of things that can transform our lives, including faster download speeds, low latency, and more capacity and connectivity for billions of devices – especially in the areas of virtual reality, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. Its use would result in smarter logistics, advanced healthcare, modernised mining and much more.If data usage is further analysed, almost two-thirds of it is being used for watching YouTube and social media engagements. Then, does it make sense to invest in 5G for YouTube, Facebook, TikTok etc.?Amid forex reserve constraints, Executive Committee of the National Economic Council has put Teletalk's 5G expansion project on hold for now.Planning Minister MA Mannan has announced that ""the prime minister thinks Teletalk's 5G project is not needed right now. Its 4G service needs to be ensured first in all parts of Bangladesh"". He further said, ""not just Teletalk, all mobile operators have been asked to increase their 4G coverage"".With the current lack of 5G usage in Bangladesh, the government's pragmatic decision to delay the 5G launch/expansion is commendable. The investment in 5G would yield no benefits for either the country or the companies involved in the short-medium term.It is also laudable that the telecom regulator has auctioned spectrum at a reasonable price to ensure 4G coverage and quality.However, operators would still prefer to embark on 5G merely to take early movers' advantage and for the sake of competitive benefits despite the lack of sufficient use cases to justify it. With the existing spectrum available for 5G with operators, private 5G services may be offered selectively to reap benefits in areas like ports, mining etc.Before launching 5G, it is imperative to ensure a collaboration between the government and multi-stakeholders to address current usage by means of taxation (on user), regulation, local content, use cases and coverage barriers (fragmented licensing, discriminatory tax on operators) and so on.There is no denial that 5G is essential to achieve Bangladesh's 2041 goal. But it is not an immediate requirement given the huge investment involved, the current ecosystem and forex reserve constraints far outweigh the desired benefits.Rather the stakeholders should use this wait time to ensure digital inclusion through 4G network and, prepare better for 5G with sufficient use cases and infrastructure readiness.The author is a telecom and management expert."

One thing that stood out for me even watching you play, was the fact that so many people around the world, not just in the world of tennis got behind you, supporting you and that kind of unity I've never seen for any other individual athlete ever. That is something that cannot be created, that cannot be generated in anyway.""You had that special ability always. It was very evident when we watched you play and the aura you brought on court is unmatchable. And for me, you're always going to be the greatest of all time. I'm sure in the next phase of your life you're going to have as much fun and as much enjoyment as you did on the court. I wish you all the best and your family as well. Take care,"" said the India batter,"" he had further added.

/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/search-space-and-meaning-iftikhar-uddin-ahmeds-solo-exhibition-ends-today-3131791,"""Searching for Space"", a solo exhibition featuring Iftikhar Uddin Ahmed's artworks is currently underway at La Galerie, Alliance Francaise, Dhaka.Ahmed's artworks connect the past with the present, characterised by the skillful use of broken lines, doodles, and textures. The prominence of wheels, broken pillars, clocks, and keys in his semi-abstract work demonstrates the concept and importance of time. It was one of the central themes followed by the diverse body of work on display.Iftikhar Uddin Ahmed, a freelance artist by profession, was born and brought up in Dhaka. After completing his master's degree in Drawing and Painting from the Institute of Fine Arts, he received a scholarship to continue his education on modern painting at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, France.Ahmed has several glorious achievements to his name, including the First Prize in Painting at Artists of the World, Galerie Bennanos, Paris in 1994; an Honourable Mention Award at the 9th Asian Art Biennale in 1999 and the Bangladesh Charushilpi Sangsad Biennale in 2000.The artist has a unique approach towards space. ""Space is an idea that differs from person to person. For some it could mean physical distance while others can think of it as an open canvas,"" he explained. The mixed media artworks on display reflect an inherent search for space, new ideas, hidden meanings and inspiration.""Artists in Bangladesh are greatly limited by a signature style and artform. For me, art is the freedom to imagine and should never be restricted to one theme. I believe diversity is what makes us unique as artists,"" asserted Ahmed. In the exhibition, none of the artworks seem to be connected to each other, with all of them having their own individual appeal.Ahmed is greatly inspired by the idea of real art and describes it as the power to defy reality. ""Art must have the power to put forward something that is naturally impossible. It is this escape from reality that I usually attempt for,"" he shared.In one of his artworks, ""Dream"", we can see typewriters floating in the air, appearing to have fallen from the sky. One of them is hitting the ground, with a motivational message printed out form it. Set in a foreign countryside location, it instantly catches the attention of viewers among the other dark pieces.Many of the artworks beautifully depict the progression and destruction following time. The ""Lost City"" shares the story of an old town, through the conversation between a guitar and a piano. These musical instruments are a testament to the time and the liveliness the city once possessed. It shows how everything has a definite life cycle, an idea that is explored in several other pieces.Another popular artwork is ""71 Bangladesh, Genocide"" which depicts the horrors of the mass killings that shook the nation in 1971. It is the only artwork with Bangladeshi representation and explores how merciless the murders were. There also lies a flag on the ground, emphasising on the impending fight for independence.The artworks are available for sale and the exhibition is open for all till today, September 30."

The bitumen has eroded in many parts. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
During dry season, the road is engulfed in dust and in monsoon. There is water and a thick layer of  mud.
This is the state of one of the busiest roads in Rupsha upazila for the last eight years.



As a result, for Khulna residents, using the Bir Shrestha Ruhul Amin Road has turned into a living nightmare.
According to LGED sources, the road's length is around seven kilometres It starts from the eastern bank of Rupsha Ferry Ghat and ends at Zabusa Bazar via Char Rupsa, Bagmara. The road has seen no repairs since 2015 .
Visiting the road last week, this correspondent saw around four km of the road (from Orion Power Plant to Ferry ghat) in a dilapidated state.



Rickshaw and van drivers were seen pushing their vehicles as there was no scope to drive it properly. Some pedestrians even chose to pass the road on barefoot, wading through murky water and mud.
 








Along the road, there are at least 15 shrimp processing factories and ice mills, three primary schools, coast guard office, police camp and several important facilities. At least 50 shrimp buying agents run their business on both sides of the road.
Md Kamal Hossain Bulbul, chairman of Naihati Union Parishad, said it's almost shameful that the road named after a Bir Shrestha is being neglected this way.
Although the road is under LGED, the road is categorised as ""Village Road-A"" in documents.  However, large vehicles of fish companies, heavy vehicles of power plants and many vehicles of the under-construction Rupsha rail bridge ply the road.
""There are also brick, sand, stone and coal dealers on both sides of the road and overloaded trucks from those places ply it regularly. This made the  road unusable,"" said Kamal Hossain.
Jalal Sheikh, a van driver in Bagmara, said, ""It has become difficult to use the road. Not a day goes by that cars don't get stuck in the potholes.""
Yasin Miah, a truck driver who regularly transports construction materials through the road, said sometimes vehicles have to be towed by another truck.
Contacted, LGED engineer SM Wahiduzzaman said, ""The maximum capacity of the road is 15 to 20 tonnes. But vehicles carrying 50 to 60 tonnes of goods regularly travel through it. The road's capacity needs to be increased from scratch. I sent a proposal to update it's category from  'Village Road-A' to 'Union Road'.""
""Over Tk 100 crore is needed to repair the road's main 4km portion and management of Rupsha river erosion but the road's category doesn't match with the fund that we asked for. Since the government allots funding based on the categories, the road's repair work is also being delayed,"" he added.

/news/bangladesh/agriculture/news/sheikh-hasina-the-farmers-voice-3131481,"After a long wait, Zillur Rahman was sworn in as the president of Bangladesh on February 12, 2009, a month after the swearing-in ceremony of the prime minister (PM) and the new cabinet. A few days later, a grand reception was held at Bangabhaban, where the president and the prime minister were surrounded by all the noted persons of the country.I went in front of the president and the prime minister and said today is the last day of Magh and it's raining outside. I put the microphone in front of the prime minister and recited the first verse of a popular proverb, ""If rain falls at the end of Magh,"" she instantly recited all the two verses, ""If rain falls at the end of Magh. Blessed king's, virtuous land.""Then I asked Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, 'It seems the harvest will be good this season, what is your opinion in this regard?""She said her government will pay special attention to agriculture in future action plan.I am a person who deeply believes that the country cannot be taken to the desired destination, if water is not given to the root of the farming sector.Soon after taking office, the inaugural cabinet meeting announced the first gift for the farmers by reducing the fertilisers price, bringing down the price of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) from Tk 90 (USD 0.89) to Tk 22 (USD 0.22) per kilogram (kg) Muriate of Potash (MOP) from Tk 70 (USD 0.69) to Tk 15 (USD 0.15) per kg.One of my biggest achievements is the prime minister has been constantly supporting the farmers, researchers and the policymakers.She used to watch Hridoye Mati O Manush on Channel i regularly and was fond of the boat race held in Gopalganj's Ghaghar river.  She said Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman used to hand over brass pitcher as prize to the winners of the traditional boat race.I have had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister on several occasions regarding her yard farming in Gono Bhaban premises.I am looking for the opportunity to record a special programme on her agricultural philosophy and practice. I believe, that occasion will come one day.According to her election manifesto, ""Din Badaler Sanad"" (A Charter for Change), she took various steps including subsidies in agricultural mechanisation, opening bank accounts for farmers at Tk 10 (USD 0.09), increasing irrigation facilities and incentives in agriculture.In 2009, the production of food grains was 33.83 million tonnes, which has now increased to 45.34 million tonnes.The country has progressed a lot in the last few years. What is the reason behind this?The main reason is the philosophy of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and the prime minister played the vital role in bringing back positive impacts across the country.Indeed, the pandemic has taken away a lot, but taught us the biggest lesson: how to exercise the right leadership with courage.Today, Bangladesh has made a remarkable progress in terms of food production and agricultural success.The country ranks third in rice production, third in vegetable, seventh in mango, seventh in potato, eighth in guava, fourth in tea, second in jute, third in inland freshwater fish and first in hilsa production.There is no scope to deny that the whole world is facing food crisis and economic recession and we are going to face a big setback in food production in future.In the past few years, I had the opportunity to attend the prime minister's press conferences where I questioned her on many issues regarding agriculture.During a press conference a few days back, she was talking about agricultural practices in the courtyards of people living in the Ashrayan projects.I am impressed to see the prime minister paying attention to the issues raised in my TV programme, Hridoye Mati O Manush.During the Covid-19 pandemic period, she advised people to engage in rooftop farming.My warmest wishes to the honourable prime minister on her birthday."
