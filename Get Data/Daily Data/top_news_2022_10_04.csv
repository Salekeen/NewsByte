/nrb/news/ransom-paid-bangladeshi-abducted-malaysia-yet-be-freed-3134746,Ransom paid but Bangladeshi abducted in Malaysia yet to be freed,"A 39-year-old Bangladeshi expatriate, who was abducted in Malaysia on September 25, 2022, was not released even after the payment of Tk 5 lakh ransom.Victim Sohel Miah's family members have lodged complaints with Bangladesh and Malaysia police stations as he remains traceless for nine days.Sohel, son of late Ahmed Miah of Dakshin Dhalapara village in Ghatail upazila of Tangail, has been working in a factory in Malaysia for over 15 years.According to Sohel's neighbours in Malaysia, the abductors picked him up from in front of his home in Tamiljaya neighborhood of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, on September 25 at 9pm (local time).Mizan, another Bangladeshi expatriate and next-door neighbour of Sohel, said, ""On the day of the incident, the victim came from work and spoke to his mother on mobile phone before going down. He was picked up from in front of his house by the abductors.""On September 28, Sohel's brother-in-law, Billal Hossain, filed a complaint with Ghatail Police Station in Tangail in this regard.On the other hand, Hashem Ahmed, a relative of Sohel and also a Malaysian expatriate, filed a complaint with Johor Bahru Police Station in Malaysia on October 2, 2022.According to the complaint lodged with the police stations, Billal received a call from a Malaysian number on September 25. Abductors threatened that if he doesn't pay Tk 5 lakh, Sohel will be killed. The next morning at 10 am, Sohel called him from the same number and said, ""If you don't send the money quickly, they will kill me"".Where or to whom should the money be sent? -- When asked, another Bangladeshi took the phone from Sohel and gave the account number of an organisation named Kulpatoa Poultry Feed under Janata Bank Barishal branch and asked Billal to send the ransom there.The family of Sohel quickly raised the ransom money by taking a loan. The funds were then deposited to the bank account provided by the abductors on September 27.A money receipt for Tk 5 lakh was sent to the abductors' WhatsApp account on the same day. The kidnappers responded with ""OK"" from the other end.However, the phone number is now switched off and there has not been any communication since that time.Contacted, Nazmus Sadat Selim, minister (labour) of Bangladesh High Commission in Malaysia, said the high commission is not aware of the abduction. So far, no written complaints have been received yet. The High Commission will act quickly if it receives a complaint, he added."
/business/economy/news/rampal-power-plant-take-time-start-running-3134451,Rampal power plant to take time to start running,"One of the Rampal power plant's two units was inaugurated last month but it still requires some machinery to practically start running. Moreover, a lack of synchronisation has led to the government incurring extra costs in the form of demurrage being paid to ships which have already arrived with coal but are having to await construction of the plant's jetties.The Maitree super thermal power project is being implemented by Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company, a 50:50 joint venture between Bangladesh Power Development Board and Indian government-owned electric utility company National Thermal Power Corporation.It is located at Rampal in Bagerhat district, which is 14 kilometres north-west of the Sundarbans mangrove forest.The plant is approximately costing $2 billion, of which $1.6 billion is being sourced as Indian Development Assistance under a concessional financing scheme.Bangladesh Premier Sheikh Hasina and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually inaugurated one of the plant's two units on September 6 during an official visit of the former to Delhi.At that time, it was announced that the plant would start running on the first week of October.""We have started trial…production capacity showed 160MW so technical setups are required to take the generation capacity of a single unit to the targeted 660MW,"" said Sayeed Akram Ullah, managing director of Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company last week.""We are expecting it would take at least mid-November to go into commercial generation of power as it is not the type of work that can be completed overnight…it is a technical work related to technology,"" he said.Akram hopes for the second unit to start running in April next year.Regarding the construction of the plant's three jetties, he said one was complete.The three will enable unloading 5,000 tonnes of coal in four hours, which is the amount of fuel the two units will need every day to produce 1,320MW of electricity, he said.Sources informed that coal-laden ships were already at the site awaiting unloading and being paid demurrage.Another issue was that draft of the Pasur river adjoining the plant was less than four metres, for which multiple lighters were needed instead of the mother ship coming right in.This requires dredging, said Akram.Subash Chandra Pandey, director of the project, did not provide any comment in this regard. "
/news/world/usa/news/trump-sues-cnn-defamation-seeks-475-million-3134726,"Trump sues CNN for defamation, seeks $475 million","Former US president Donald Trump sued CNN for defamation on Monday, seeking $475 million in punitive damages and claiming the network had carried out a ""campaign of libel and slander"" against him.Trump claims in his lawsuit, filed in US District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, that CNN had used its considerable influence as a leading news organisation to defeat him politically.CNN declined to comment on the case.Trump, a Republican, claims in the 29-page lawsuit that CNN had a long track record of criticising him but had ramped up its attacks in recent months because the network feared that he would run again for president in 2024.""As a part of its concerted effort to tilt the political balance to the left, CNN has tried to taint the Plaintiff with a series of ever-more scandalous, false, and defamatory labels of 'racist,' 'Russian lackey,' 'insurrectionist,' and ultimately 'Hitler,'"" the lawsuit claims.The lawsuit lists several instances in which CNN appeared to compare Trump to Hitler, including a January 2022 special report by host Fareed Zakaria that included footage of the German dictator.Trump, who in 2020 lost a re-election bid to Democrat Joe Biden, has not said whether he would seek re-election.In a statement, the former president said he would be filing lawsuits against other major media companies ""in the coming weeks and months,"" and that he could even take action against a congressional committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.The lawsuit comes as the 76-year-old former president faces considerable legal woes, including a criminal investigation by the US Justice Department for retaining government records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in January 2021.Trump was sued last month by New York state Attorney General Leticia James, who has accused him of lying to banks and insurers over the value of his assets."
/business/economy/news/govt-getting-ready-cepa-talks-india-3134436,Govt getting ready for CEPA talks with India,"Bangladesh has started the groundwork to begin negotiations for signing a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India, as has been agreed upon by top leaders of both countries last month. If it is finally signed, the CEPA will be the first, full-fledged trade agreement for Bangladesh.The country has been lobbying with major trading partners for many years to get free trade agreements (FTAs) signed.So far, only a preferential trade agreement (PTA) could be signed with Bhutan in December 2020.It enables duty free access to 34 Bhutanese and 100 Bangladeshi goods.""We are taking our preparations for starting the negotiation with India as this is a trade agreement which has three components -- tariff, services and investment,"" said Senior Commerce Secretary Tapan Kanti Ghosh.Senior Commerce Secretary Tapan Kanti Ghosh said since India was a very big source for imports and also a big potential export destination, a lot of research needs to be conducted before the formal start of the negotiations 


Senior Commerce Secretary Tapan Kanti Ghosh said since India was a very big source for imports and also a big potential export destination, a lot of research needs to be conducted before the formal start of the negotiations Ghosh said since India was a very big source for imports and also a big potential export destination, a lot of research needs to be conducted before the formal start of the negotiations.So, the commerce ministry is conducting studies to identify the kinds of goods Bangladesh imports, the kinds of goods that may be exported to India and the historic trade trends between the two countries, he said.However, neither country has sent any formal letter so far on starting negotiations.Still, Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi had announced in a joint statement that the CEPA negotiations would start from December this year.""I am also hopeful that the formal negotiations will start from December,"" Ghosh also said.Since the CEPA is a detailed form of an FTA and India is a major source for imports, experts suggested maintaining a list of sensitive commodities so that the government can also generate a significant amount of revenue from import duties from India.Last fiscal year, Bangladesh imported goods worth $16.19 billion from India, the second biggest source of imports after China.The Bangladesh government also generated more than Tk 15,000 crore from the import duty from India.Also last month, a joint study said Bangladesh might not make a large gain from the proposed CEPA as Bangladesh would lose its duty-free market access benefit to the Indian markets which was provided for it being a least developed country (LDC).Comparatively, India will make a larger gain from the trade deal primarily because through the removal of high tariff rates which it currently faces in Bangladesh, said the Joint Feasibility Study on the CEPA.Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute (BFTI) and the Indian Centre for Regional Trade (CRT) jointly conducted the study last week based on trade data of both countries between 2015 and 2020.Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi on September 5 discussed the proposed CEPA negotiations during an official visit of Hasina to India.The CEPA is a part of Bangladesh's preparations for retaining duty benefits once it makes the United Nations status graduation from an LDC to a developing nation in 2026.Moreover, Bangladesh has the potential to benefit from the trade of services in tourism, transport and educational cooperation and also creation of jobs locally from Indian investment.However, Bangladesh should slowly liberalise or maintain a list of sensitive products which is widely practised in signing such deals worldwide, experts said.Therefore, the trade relationship with India is dominated by imports. If goods and services through informal channels were considered, imports from India would increase substantially. India is an important travel, education, and health tourism destination for Bangladesh, the study said.Bangladesh is one of the most protected economies in the world with the nominal protection rate being as high as 27 per cent.If Bangladesh signs an FTA with India, leaving the current high tariff rates unchanged, trade diversion effects will be substantial.It has been estimated that an FTA or CEPA-kind of agreement with India alone could result in trade diversion worth of $700 million, said MA Razzaque, research director of Policy Research Institute (PRI).This is the amount of trade that is now taking place with other countries but would be lost due to preferential tariffs granted to one country, he said last month.Furthermore, about 14 per cent of Bangladesh's imports are sourced from India with an average applied tariff rate of more than 20 per cent.""We have estimated that the potential tariff revenue loss from a comprehensive bilateral goods trade agreement with India will be to the tune of around $2 billion,"" he added.Some 67.3 per cent of the total capital goods imports from India were duty free followed by 56.9 per cent of fuel imports and 30.2 per cent of industrial supplies. "
/business/economy/news/cheaper-cotton-raises-hopes-higher-rmg-work-orders-3134341,Cheaper cotton raises hopes of higher RMG work orders,"The slowdown in demand and stronger US dollar worldwide has pushed down cotton prices in the international market, raising hopes of increased work orders from global brands and retailers among local garment makers.Cotton prices fell to around 84-85 cents per pound in the International Futures yesterday from the previous rate of between $1.05 and $1.06 per pound last month.""We may receive more work orders from abroad because of the price fall of cotton but at the same time, global retailers and brands will put pressure on local suppliers to reduce prices,"" said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.So ultimately, local garment suppliers might not be greatly benefited from the significant price fall of cotton, he added.Similarly, local spinners, millers and cotton importers may not have reason to cheer for the fall in cotton prices because they already have unsold stockpiles of yarn.Razeeb Haider, director of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, said spinners currently have a lot of unsold yarn in their mills because of lower demand from garment manufacturers.So, the spinners might not be benefited from the price fall of cotton in international markets, he said, adding that higher inflation and lower demand has put them in a tight corner.Moreover, spinners cannot spin cotton adequately because of low gas pressure that has restricted production by almost 50 per cent.In addition, importers do not feel encouraged to import more cotton because of the higher price of US dollar, he added.As such, Bangladesh cannot take the opportunity of lower cotton price now, Haider said.Bangladesh imports 9.5 million tonnes of cotton annually at a cost of more than $3 billion.Global cotton production is up 1.4 million bales at 118.4 million, and stocks are projected higher this month and unchanged from the previous year, according to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) last month.Consumption is down slightly at 118.6 million bales with lower projected use in Pakistan and Vietnam.Global trade is unchanged though as higher US exports more than offset lower shipments of the fibre from Brazil.The US balance sheet shows higher beginning stocks, production, exports, and ending stocks. Production has grown to 1.3 million bales with larger prospects for most major producing states compared with last month, the USDA report said."
/news/asia/news/north-korea-tests-longest-range-missile-over-japan-3134711,North Korea tests longest-range missile over Japan,"-- Missile flies over Japan for first time since 2017-- May have been intermediate-range ballistic missile-- Japan issues shelter warning, stops some trains-- Apparent test condemned by US, S Korea, JapanNuclear-armed North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan for the first time in five years on Tuesday, prompting a warning for residents to take cover and a temporary suspension of train operations in northern Japan.The Japanese government warned citizens to take cover as the missile appeared to have flown over and past its territory before falling into the Pacific Ocean.It was the first North Korean missile to follow such a trajectory since 2017, and Tokyo said its 4,600 km (2,850 miles) range may have been the longest distance travelled for a North Korean test flight, which are more often ""lofted"" higher into space to avoid flying over neighbouring countries.The latest launch was Pyongyang's fifth in 10 days, amid military muscle-flexing by the United States, South Korea, and Japan. Last week, the three countries conducted trilateral anti-submarine exercises that included a US aircraft carrier, which stopped in South Korea for the first time since 2017.Recent tests have drawn relatively muted responses from Washington, which is focused on the war in Ukraine as well as other domestic and foreign crises, but the US military has stepped up displays of force in the region.Tokyo said it took no steps to shoot the missile down. Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada said Japan wouldn't rule out any options, including counterattack capabilities, as it looks to strengthen its defences in the face of repeated missile launches from North Korea. South Korea also said it would boost its military and increase allied cooperation.""North Korea's series of actions, including its repeated ballistic missile launches, threatens the peace and security of Japan, the region, and the international community, and poses a serious challenge to the entire international community, including Japan,"" Japan's top government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno, told a news conference.Officials in Tokyo and Seoul said the missile flew between 4,500 to 4,600 kilometres (2,850 miles) to a maximum altitude of about 1,000 km.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said it appeared to have been an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) launched from North Korea's Jagang Province. North Korea has used that province to launch several recent tests, including multiple missiles that it claimed were ""hypersonic.""The test prompted East Japan Railway Co (9020.T) to suspend train operations in the northern regions, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported. Matsuno said there were no reports of damage to aircraft or ships from the missile.The initial flight details suggest the missile may have been the Hwasong-12 IRBM, which North Korea unveiled in 2017 as part of its threatened plan to strike US military bases in Guam, said Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who now teaches at Kyungnam University.The Hwasong-12 was used in 2017 tests that overflew Japan, and Kim noted it was also test fired from Jagang Province in January.Flying a missile such a long distance allows North Korea's scientists to test missiles under more realistic conditions, said Ankit Panda of the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.""Compared to the usual highly lofted trajectory, this allows them to expose a long-range reentry vehicle to thermal loads and atmospheric reentry stresses that are more representative of the conditions they'd endure in real-world use,"" he said.""Politically, it's complicated: the missile largely flies outside of the atmosphere when it's over Japan, but it's obviously distressing to the Japanese public to receive warnings of a possible incoming North Korean missile.""North Korea's flurry of missile testing helps make more of its weapons operational, develop new capabilities and sends a message that development is s sovereign right, analysts said.North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programmes are banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions, which have imposed sanctions on the country.South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol called the test ""reckless"" and said it would bring a decisive response from his country's military, its allies and the international community.He has pushed for more military muscle to deter the North, and South Korea staged its own show of advanced weaponry on Saturday to mark its Armed Forces Day, including multiple rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, main battle tanks, drones and F-35 fighters.Speaking to reporters in Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called North Korea's actions ""barbaric"", and said the government would continue to gather and analyse information.The launch over Japan was ""unfortunate"" and ""not a productive path forward,"" Daniel Kritenbrink, the top US diplomat for East Asia, said during an online event hosted by the Institute for Corean-American Studies.The North has completed preparations for a nuclear test, which it might look to undertake sometime between China's Communist Party Congress this month and US mid-term elections in November, South Korean lawmakers said last week."
/news/bangladesh/news/where-tradition-meets-craftsmanship-3134536,Where tradition meets craftsmanship,"It is very easy for one to get woefully lost in the crevices and back alleys of Old Dhaka even with a guidebook. When one thinks of visiting Old Dhaka, Shakhari Bazar is a place that gets mentioned by almost all who either have lived or visited the area, thanks to its history associated with craftsmen.With the advent of Puja, Shakhari Bazar livens up with festivity and sales.Located near the intersection of Islampur Road and Nawabpur Road -- the two main arteries of the old city and only a block away from the Buriganga, Shakhari Bazar stretches along a narrow lane, lined with thin slices of richly decorated brick buildings built during the late Mughal or colonial period.The name of the area is credited to the Shakhari community, who have kept the craft of making and selling ""Shakha"" (a white bangle made out of conch shells) -- traditionally worn by married Hindu women -- alive for ages.The history of Shakhari Bazar dates back to the pre-Mughal days, if not earlier. The first mention of Puran Dhaka can be found in the writings of Mirza Nathan, the general turned historian, who travelled with Subahdar Islam Khan.He mentioned Puran Dhaka as the area between Dholai Khal and Buriganga river -- covering Shakhari Bazar, Tanti Bazar, Bangla Bazaar, Lakhsmi Bazaar, Bangla Bazaar, Kamar Nagar, Sutar Nagar, Goala Nagar, and many more. Each ""mohalla"" or area used to belong to separate communities, depending on their craft and trade.However, the Liberation War changed this demography as many Hindu craftsmen had to leave everything behind to save their lives.The ones who survived are the ones who have continued the lineage of their ancestral profession to the modern day, despite various difficulties. These craftspeople care deeply about their craft, so much so that many have said that their business and their very existence are intertwined.And when one sees any of these ""Shakha"" or ""Pola"", that dedication surely reflects.This correspondent spoke to many who are involved in this traditional craft at Shakhari Bazar, to understand the state of their affairs ahead of puja.Shourav Chandra Shur (29), a Shakha and Puja appliance salesman at ""Sreeguru Bhander"", said, ""I'm the third generation in this business. My father and grandfather still take charge of a few of the shifts.""""We are seeing better sales now, owing to the puja season. Orders for this season were already sent out two months ahead. Our regulars are already picking up their orders,"" he added.Walking down the winding Shakhari Bazar road, this correspondent saw crowds gathering in almost every store. Some were visiting with their mothers, in-laws and daughters to buy Shakha and Pola.Nandita Deb, a local who was seen at ""Shur Brothers"", said, ""I live in Road-52 in this area. I visit this store every year because they sell the best Shakha. The price this time has not increased drastically as well.""Johnny Shukh (35), a salesman at ""Nag Vander"" has been working there for almost 14 years now. He highlighted that while there used to be many artisans available, their numbers have reduced over time.""There was once a time we could do everything -- from making the initial structure, down to the final polish. Now we just sell ready-made products. Many of these products come from India.""""A single shakha has to go through nine artisans to procure the final product. Hence, we don't bring in the raw, plain ones anymore as we only have a few artisans who can engrave designs on the shakhas,"" added Johnny.Speaking on the current puja sales and stock, he said, ""We usually bring around 2,000 to 4,000 shakhas in a single lot. At the store, we keep shakhas ranging between Tk 300 and Tk 5,000.""""During puja, shakhas worth Tk 700 to Tk 800 sell out the fastest. Some customers purchase shakhas worth Tk 400 to Tk 600 for rough use. The thick and wide ones are quite popular this season and their cost starts at Tk 3,000,"" he added.On the other hand, Kartik Chandra Dhar, proprietor of Mahabir Pola Store, said, ""Like everyone else, our business suffered greatly during the last two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We are seeing a rush during puja season, but I can't say that sales have risen exponentially.""""The pola that you're seeing here is brought to Chawkbazar from India. If products worth Tk 5,000 are sold, we bring in more,"" he added.The biggest crowd was seen at ""Ma Mansha Shankha Shilpolay"" where four salesmen were seen tending to eager customers.Papiya Ray, a Wari resident who was seen purchasing Shakha from ""Ma Mansha Shankha Shilpaloy"", said, ""I have been coming to this store ever since I got married. I love coming here since the shop owners know me personally and treat me dearly. They know exactly what I like and I can come here any time to get repairs done.""Shoumitra Nath, one of the owners, said, ""Starting from the first of the Bangla month of Ashwhin till puja, we have made really good business. The biggest issue is that due to the price hike of gold, the premium shakhas are selling less.""""In terms of design, we try to keep up with the latest trends. For example, this puja, wide shakhas are quite popular. Customers are mostly purchasing shakha within the range of Tk 200 to Tk 600. We get a lot of sales during the wedding season as well,"" he said.Speaking of their craft, Shoumitra said, ""This business has been our ancestral profession for about 100 years now. Currently, my father is in charge, after him, it will be me and then my son.""""Our business only caters to the demand that exists, and the pool of people we sell to is very small. But I can say for sure that as long as our religious practices and religious harmony exist, so will our business,"" he added.   "
/business/economy/news/bangladesh-oasis-growth-3134426,Bangladesh–an oasis of growth,"Bangladesh is currently weathering a period of heightened external pressure and economic headwinds like it has done since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and kept growing, said a top official of a multinational bank.  ""I am seeing an oasis of growth here in Bangladesh. Not only it is resilient, but it is also one of the few countries that continued to expand during the pandemic and – as I understand – grew more than 17 per cent over the last three years,"" said Benjamin Hung, chief executive officer of Standard Chartered for Asia.He was in Dhaka recently. During the visit, he met the finance secretary and the governor of the Bangladesh Bank.""It is great to hear their plans to diversify Bangladesh's industries – augmenting the strength you have developed from the garments industry to other sectors, from investments into infrastructure, remittances, and a whole variety of aspects favouring the development of Bangladesh.""Besides, he met with many corporates and was encouraged by both the foresight and desire of the country to follow through to the next chapter.""I am confident in Bangladesh's great potential to take its economy further forward,"" he told The Daily Star in an interview.Hung has been working at Standard Chartered since 1992 and was appointed as the CEO of Standard Chartered for Asia in January 2021. He also sits on the group's management team and is the chairman of Standard Chartered Bank (China) Ltd.According to him, the financial sector of Bangladesh is one of the top 10 FDI-attracting sectors with major inflows from the UK, the US, and China. A burgeoning middle-class is sending demand higher for increasingly sophisticated financial products and a dynamic mobile financial services sector is causing ripples of disruption across the pyramid, driving financial inclusion.""The confluence of shifting consumer patterns and technological investments has led to digital channels experiencing unprecedented growth. Domestic banks are becoming increasingly sophisticated.""Hung was bullish about Bangladesh's potential.""Bangladesh strikes me as a country of immense opportunities. It is weathering a period of heightened external pressure and economic headwinds that have impacted many economies. With economic growth trajectory remaining stable and with the mitigatory effects of policy actions being visible, it seems that Bangladesh remains on course to achieve sustainable growth.""In his view, there are some key strategic levers the country could draw on to accelerate growth.One is mobilising investment to address the infrastructure deficit.""Economies need to be more connected than they are now, both within and outside their borders. It is not just about the obvious infrastructure – bridges, railroads, ports, but digital infrastructure as well.""Bangladesh needs an estimated $320 billion of infrastructure investment by 2030 if it is to fulfil its potential to act as the gateway to the massive regional markets in South Asia and Asean.""Developing viable and efficient financing strategies that mobilise resources nationally and globally for infrastructure projects is vital,"" according to Hung.So far, Standard Chartered has raised more than $7 billion of financing in power, telecommunication, infrastructure, and other key sectors and can play a vital role in answering how to optimally structure these projects.""Implementing the right policies to encourage physical and digital infrastructure that will spur flows of trade, investment, information, and people will accelerate the nation's rising prosperity,"" Hung said.""For instance, bridging the Padma River is a historic achievement that is a marker for things to come.""The Standard Chartered top regional official is also aware of the challenges facing the country owing to global warming.While Bangladesh only accounts for a tiny proportion of global emissions, it is in the top 10 of the world's most-affected countries by climate change. The north-eastern floods that happened earlier this year are yet another reminder of the immediacy of the challenge.""Bangladesh needs to be in tune with the collective effort to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions to limit temperature rises,"" Hung said.A study, commissioned by the London-headquartered bank, found that Bangladesh-based suppliers are risking almost $18.7 billion in exports each year if carbon emissions are not cut in line with their biggest clients' net zero plans.""At the same time, we need to accelerate change. This calls for a greater public-private partnership to unlock more investment and drive the action required. Coordinated government policy, incentivisation and structures that direct money to the projects required to raise this capital will be crucial,"" Hung said.""Innovations from the private sector will also be required, including new technologies to help communities adapt and new financial products that direct capital to the technologies and projects where the need is greatest.""When asked about the thoughts that keep him up at night, he lists the Covid-19 pandemic, the geopolitical tensions and their ever-changing dynamics, and supply chain disruptions.""The scale and depth of today's challenges are something I have never experienced before in my 35-year banking career.""Amidst these headwinds, Hung says, it is easy to overlook that it is these exact shifts that are presenting emerging opportunities for businesses.""Particularly here in Asia, we are seeing some really transformational and structural changes that will be to the benefit of all of us living here.""Intra-Asia trade dynamics have blossomed over the years.""We have had almost three to four decades of manufacturing in the East for consumption by the West. I think in the next 10 to 30 years, we will be seeing a lot more of the East producing for the East on the backdrop of rising middle classes in Asia,"" Hung said.He also touched upon digitalisation and the fourth industrial revolution, which are bringing about huge business model changes that will have a benefit in terms of how businesses operate.""That said, vigilance about cybersecurity is critical – cyberattacks come with significant consequences and we can only expect their frequency, scale, and sophistication to increase. There is also the sustainability side of things, which presents a challenge, but also an opportunity.""Over the last two decades, Bangladesh grew consistently by over 6 per cent year-on-year.

""Physically he is probably in the greatest spot of his physical career. Emotionally he is sound.""We have got full faith in his wicketkeeping skillset so he has ticked all of the boxes.""Paine was appointed to repair Australia's reputation after the 2018 ""Sandpaper-gate"" ball-tampering scandal which rocked world cricket and cost Steve Smith the captaincy.When Paine quit, Pat Cummins took over as Test captain with Aaron Finch the white-ball skipper.""I think it's really good for Australian cricket to have Tim around,"" Finch said on the Gold Coast ahead of Australia's T20 clash with the West Indies on Wednesday.""For Tasmania to have his experience back around the side with a squad that has got a few young players, the Tasmanian side will be better for that.""I think Australian cricket is better for having Tim involved in a playing capacity."""
/news/bangladesh/rights/news/hate-crimes-dsa-twin-terrors-the-minorities-3134651,"Hate Crimes, DSA: Twin terrors for the minorities","On one hand, there were at least 22 incidents of Hindu religious sites being attacked this year.On the other, there were at least seven incidents in which members of the minority community were sued or arrested under the Digital Security Act or other laws for ""hurting religious sentiments"".While both are examples of ""hurt sentiments"", the legal actions taken  were vastly different.Incarcerated Pritom Das's home in Srimangal is sombre during this year's Durga Puja celebrations.Pritom, a mobiliser of an organisation named ""Rashtra Sanskar Andolon"", was arrested a month ago under the DSA. He has since been rejected bail and is now spending Puja in jail.His favourite delicacy during this time of the year was his mother's special mutton curry. His brother Piyas Das said no one in their home is in the mood to get into lengthy culinary preparations.""After all, there is no celebration in jail.""Pritom's alleged crime was posting a quote by the Urdu writer Saadat Hasan Manto, where someone asked the writer what the situation of the country was and he responded, ""Just like the Friday prayers in jail ..."".This literary reference was lost on the plaintiff --  24-year-old Chhatra League activist Mahbub Alam Bhuiyan -- who took one look at Das's surname and concluded that his religious sentiments were decidedly hurt.While Pritom languishes in jail, artisan Bhaskar Ranjan Pal of Satkhira's Agardari village still does not know who vandalised his workshop and destroyed as many as 53 idols in the making.The incident happened in the middle of the night on January 24 this year. The photos of the attack show idols under construction with heads and arms askew after being battered with blunt objects.Bhaskar said he closed his shop at 9:00pm and went home. He found his workshop vandalised when he went back the next morning.""I am an over-60-year-old poor artisan, working for 35 years. I don't have any enemies. I don't know who did this and why. Nothing like this has ever happened before.""He estimated his losses at Tk 42,000.Even though a case was filed, nobody was ever apprehended because none of the criminals could be identified, said Swapan Kumar Shil, who leads  Satkhira's Puja Udjapan Parishad.Two more temples -- a Swaraswati temple in Habiganj and the Shri Shri Shitla O Tara Ma temple in Narayanganj -- were vandalised the very next month.Then in March, three more temples came under attack in Dhaka and Chattogram's Banshkhali, followed by a temple in Noakhali being vandalised in April.In July, there were as many as six attacks on religious sites.These include a Ram Krishna temple in Gaibandha's Damodarpur, the Bhushondi Rathkhola temple in Tangail, temples in Dighalia of Narail, Shibaloy of Manikganj and Rangunia of Chattogram.In addition, devotees praying inside the Shri Shri Jalakumari temple in Chattogram's Chandraghona were also attacked.In August, household temples in Kurigram's Nagdanga, Barguna's Shibganj and Satkhira's Shibpur were vandalised.In September – the month leading up to the Puja celebrations -- four incidents of vandalism and looting took place in temples across Dhaka's Nababganj, Magura's Dariapur, Kushtia's Lahini Karmakar Para and Barishal's Chanpur.This is according to data collected by Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad, which maintains that nobody has been arrested in these cases, nor has there been a conviction.On the other hand, school teachers Hridoy Mondal of Munshiganj and Swapan Kumar Biswas of Narail were arrested in April and June respectively for ""hurting religious sentiments"", with the former serving jail time, and the latter publicly made to wear a garland of shoes.Only Swapan got some form of a legal remedy, with action being taken against those who publicly humiliated him.Hridoy's only consolation was being granted bail and release from prison.In addition, a Hindu house in Bagerhat's Morrelganj upazila was vandalised over a rumoured Facebook post made by 20-year-old Kaushik Biswas, who was arrested for ""hurting religious sentiments"" in April.A carnage in Narail's Dighalia's Sahapara left several Hindu houses burnt to embers and shops vandalised, all because a teenage boy allegedly uploaded a Facebook status.Both the boy and his father were detained and the former was taken on a three-day-remand under the DSA. In August, Jhumon Das was arrested in Sunamganj's Shalla, in a second DSA case, with his first being when he was arrested for posting against fallen Hefazat leader Mamunul Haque.This time too he was booked for a Facebook status that allegedly threatened religious incitement.The Puja Udjapan Parishad reported another case in Satkhira in September, in which a man named Mihir Mondal himself allegedly sought police custody after a Facebook post by him ""incited"" the community of Ashashuni village.One of the directives given by the Parishad prior to the celebrations this year include ""refraining from activities that hurt the religious sentiments of others.""As Pritom's brother Piyas told The Daily Star, ""As the minority here, we have to be careful about what we say.""The Parishad has maintained that attacks on temples are meant to hurt religious sentiments of the Hindu community.In a statement on September 24, it said, ""Using fabricated allegations of hurting religious sentiments, radical forces have been attacking, vandalising, looting and setting fire to temples and Hindu homes.""Advocate Zahirul Islam Khan Panna, human rights expert, pointed out that even the violent attacks that took place during last year's Puja celebrations have not yet seen the light of justice.""There was supposed to be a judicial enquiry, but it never took place because the Appellate Division stayed it recently due to an ongoing departmental enquiry.""On the flipside, the DSA cases filed against Pritom and the others are discriminatory and exploitative, he said.Panna, who has represented many accused under the DSA, stated, ""These cases are targeted. If you are a religious minority, if you are vulnerable, you are more likely to be a victim of the DSA. Has there been any cases filed concerning hate speech against minorities, which we see all over social media?""In the case of Jhumon Das, I read out his social media [post] in an open court and said that if I posted it, it would be considered patriotic. But since Jhumon said it, he was sued and arrested.""There were six cases filed concerning the 2016 [religious] violence in Nasirnagar. In one of those cases, a poor fisherman, Rasraj, was sued for hurting religious sentiments. He cannot even operate social media but his case is actively at the trial stage, with Rasraj being charge-sheeted. Meanwhile, the other cases have gone nowhere.""In other instances of violence against religious minorities, a notable one was the 2012 Ramu violence, in which local mobs carried out a series of attacks on Buddhist monasteries, shrines, and houses in Cox's Bazar's Ramu upazila. This 10-year-old attack has yet to see the light of justice."
/youth/education/news/literacy-rate-5-districts-fall-far-behind-the-rest-3134671,Literacy rate: 5 districts fall far behind the rest,"The literacy rates in Jamalpur, Sherpur, Bandarban, Sunamganj and Kurigram are significantly lower than the country's average.According to data from the preliminary Population and Housing Census 2022 report, Bangladesh's average literacy rate among those aged seven and above is 74.66 percent. This shows an increase by 22.89 percent since the previous census conducted in 2011, in which the literacy rate stood at 51.77 percent.However, the aforementioned five districts have the lowest rates this time.Jamalpur's literacy rate was 61.52 percent – 13.13 percent lower than the national average.Meanwhile, 63.57 percent of the people in Sherpur, 63.64 percent in Bandarban, 64.77 percent in Sunamganj, and 64.99 percent in Kurigram cannot read or write.Officials of the Bureau of Non-Formal Education (BNFE) working in these districts cited a host of factors owing to the staggeringly low literacy rates.Those factors include extreme poverty, a lack of awareness and also an absence of district-wide literacy projects, as well as continuous efforts to continue those.Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics said literacy is defined as the ability to read and write in any language.Kazi Saifuzzaman, additional director of Jamalpur BNFE, said it was true that the district's literacy rate was much lower than that in other districts.""We have a lot of char areas, and poverty there is the main reason for the low literacy rate. Most of the guardians are not educated, and many of them do not show interest in sending their children to schools.""On the other hand, adults are also reluctant to join adult literacy programmes due to poverty. Parents instead send their children to farms for agricultural work.""Other BNFE officials too blamed the absence of continuous efforts for adult literacy programmes in these districts.Manzur Ahmed, additional director of Bandarban BNFE, said the Basic Literacy Project, aimed at providing basic education to 7,000 people aged between 15 and 45, is currently in the implementation stage in his district.""Before this, we didn't have any literacy project initiative for many years. We need continuous projects for the improving literacy rate.""While there are five upazilas in Jamalpur, the BNFE is currently implementing the ""Out of School Children Programme as Second Chance Education"", to provide non-formal education, in only Jhenaigati and Sherpur Sadar upazilas to 4,200 children aged 8-14.""It would have been great if we had been able to cover the three other upazilas -- Nakla, Nalitabari and Sreebardi,"" said Syed Moktar Hossain, additional director of Sherpur BNFE.He said that as part of an earlier literacy programme, they had provided basic education to 18,000 adults of each Naliatbari and Jhenaigati, and 22,000 adults of Sreebardi.""The programme helped push up the literacy rate several years ago.""Poverty is another big factor, he added.""If a child works at a bidi factory, they might get Tk 1,000-1,500, while the school stipend is a meagre amount. To encourage children to come to school, the stipend amount has to be increased.""Razu Kumar Sarkar, additional director of Sunamganj BNFE, said the out-of-school-children project is currently benefitting 4,200 children with non-formal education in two of the 12 upazilas.Jamalpur BNFE's Kazi Saifuzzaman and Sherpur BNFE's Syed Moktar Hossain suggested continuous literacy programmes that should also provide skills development training for jobseekers.Moktar also said social movements, commitment from political leaders, and formations of union literacy committees are needed to help increase the literacy rates in the districts falling behind.Nuruzzaman Sharif, acting director general of BNFE, said the basic literacy project was recently completed and another such programme providing non-formal education is being implemented.""So, the districts falling behind, along with the rest of the country, will see improvements in terms of literacy rates.""Currently, we do not have upazila level officials. So, we will have to chalk out new initiatives to improve countrywide literacy rates.""According to the 2022 census, the literacy rate in the urban areas is 81.28 percent, while in rural areas, it is 71.56.The rate is higher among the male population, which is 76.56 percent. Among the female population, it is 72.82.The highest literacy rate – 78.09 -- was in Dhaka division."
/news/bangladesh/news/here-women-run-the-show-3134511,"Here, women run the show","Since the Duga Puja celebrations started on October 1, hundreds of people, from all walks of life, have been flocking to a particular temple in Moulvibazar town.So what's so special about the ""Durgabari temple"" on Moulvibazar's Saifur Rahman Road?The answer is simple. The six-decade-old temple has a reputation for organising one of the best pujas in the district.However, there is another catch. The temple garnered greater attractions this year by sticking with the real spirit of Durga Puja -- women empowerment.Durga Puja is not only a religious festival but also an occasion that celebrates the manifold faces of womanhood. Although it's the men who mostly call the shots in terms of organisation and performing the rituals, celebrations in the Moulvibazar temple will be run mostly by women.The temple authorities have announced a 127-member committee for running the puja this year, of which, 124 are women. The three men in the committee are holding the posts of assistants, while all the important positions have been filled up by women.Initially, there were some reservations among a section of locals on how the women would handle the pressure. However, all doubts were cleared as the committee won them over by successfully organising Mahalaya on September 25.A colourful procession was taken out on Mahalaya, while clothes were distributed among the underprivileged. It was the women who lit up the forums in the discussion meetings.The temple has been seeing a mad rush of devotees since October 1, riding on the massive success of the Mahalaya celebrations.This correspondent talked to Ranjit Datta Johny, a local, while visiting the temple on October 2.""Hundreds are visiting this place every day. Some visitors were seen being a bit judgemental, trying to nitpick anything they find. But even they were seen leaving the place with a wide smile on their face, happy with how everything went,"" he said.""Most were left mesmerised with how beautiful the idols were, along with the security arrangements, rituals, and everything in between,"" he added.He also claimed that not only Moulvibazar residents but people from nearby districts, including Brahmanbaria and Habiganj are renting cars to come and experience the celebrations organised by women.In an earlier conversation, Nandita Deb, president of the committee, said, ""Durga is the embodiment of our Dharitri Mata (Mother Erath). Durga destroys Asur with her many hands and does everything for the welfare of the devotees. Similarly, our mothers work non-stop for the welfare of their children. The formation of our committee symbolises this realisation.""The women in this committee are of many professions -- teachers, doctors, lawyers, expatriates, housewives and students.""Earlier, one or two women were kept in the committee. But this year, the status quo has been changed,"" added Nandita.Priyanka Roy, general secretary of the committee, echoed the same.Mallika Dey, Moulvibazar's additional district magistrate, said, ""Durga is considered to be the manifestation of feminine power. The leadership of these women is a perfect representation of that.""""Durga Puja is being held in 1,006 puja mandaps in the district,"" she added.According to the temple authorities, a Marwari businessman named Champalal Shando established the Durgabari temple about 80 years ago during the British period. Durga Puja has been organised there since then.  "

""All in all I have done a proper job on it!""He added: ""Anyway... on the positive side the operation went well and I am now three weeks post surgery and my staples have been removed...""One thing is for sure and that is I shall not be partaking in anything more during 2022... however I cannot wait for what 2023 holds!!""Before the injury, Bairstow had been in superb form for England, scoring 1,061 runs, including six hundreds, at an average of 66.31 during the best year of his Test career.Bairstow told the Daily Telegraph: ""Normally when you slip you fall on your bum, which would have been fine as there's plenty of cushion in there.""Except this time I tried to regain my balance, my left ankle turned right, dislocated and my weight went through my left lower leg. I heard it snap straight away.""I took a couple of steps down then slipped. By the time I crumpled into a heap, I was three-quarters of the way down. It's all a blur, it happened so quickly.""I yelped. Uncontrollable screams, the sort you hear on a rugby field. The adrenaline kicked in, and I knew I needed an ambulance.

/news/bangladesh/news/padma-bridge-wildlife-sanctuary-two-years-still-confined-words-3134661,"Padma bridge wildlife sanctuary: 2 years on, still confined to words","Two years have passed since the declaration of the Padma Bridge Wildlife Sanctuary, but the forest department is yet to take any steps to conserve the biodiversity of the Padma.
The move was a bid to reduce the impact on the biodiversity due to the construction of the bridge.
A new problem emerged about a year ago when sand mining began at various points of the river in Shariatpur and Madaripur as part of the river training work of the Padma Bridge project. The Padma Bridge Authority has permitted the dredging. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Extraction of sand is posing a threat to the aquatic life of the river, which may force schools of hilsa to migrate elsewhere. It has also exposed the river banks to erosion in Munshiganj and Shariatpur.
The environment, forest and climate change ministry in 2020 declared the river's 11,772 hectares area, including shoals and wetlands, as Padma Bridge Wildlife Sanctuary. The sanctuary covers 118 square miles in Munshiganj, Shariatpur, Madaripur and Faridpur.



Dewan Md Abdul Kader, executive engineer of the Padma Bridge Authority, said the river training work would end in June next year. ""Dredging is going on to facilitate navigation of cranes and barges around the pillars of the bridge,"" he told The Daily Star.
Forest department officials said they held several meetings within their office and also with the bridge authority on conservation of the biodiversity after the publication of the gazette. However, no measures have been taken in this regard in the last two years.
The department says it could not look after the sanctuary as the bridge authority was still carrying out river training work.



Professor Lokman Hossen, team leader of the Biodiversity Conservation Programme for Padma Bridge, said erosion of the river caused by the sand extraction has devoured two unions. ""Both the banks of the Padma are exposed to erosion because of the unbridled sand extraction.""
Hilsa has stopped migrating to the Padma, he said, adding that dolphins, locally known as Shusuk, are hardly seen in the river.
""Parts of Painpara, Teotia, Char Janajat and Korailer Char have already gone into the Padma. This is harming the biodiversity of the river,"" he told The Daily Star.
Visiting the river last month, this newspaper found more than 30 dredgers extracting sand within around 100 metres of the bridge in Mawa of Munshiganj, which is in the core zone of the sanctuary.
Sand mining in part of Sariatpur's Janjira upazila remained suspended following intervention by the local administration on the ground that it did not grant permission. Locals also held rallies demanding the authorities concerned take actions to stop the dredging of the river bed.
Md Salauddin Bepara, former chairman of Kunderchar Union Parishad in Janjira, told The Daily Star that around 400 homes and about 100 acres of arable land went into the river. ""Sand traders in connivance with some officials from the administration and police have been causing this suffering to the people,"" he said.
Shafiqul Islam, director of Padma Bridge Project, told this newspaper that they permitted 31 dredgers to mine sand as a part of the river training work.
Asked if any study was conducted to assess the harm the dredging could cause to the biodiversity, he did not give a direct answer and advised The Daily Star to talk to an expert.
Imran Ahmed, conservator of forest (wildlife and nature conservation) of the forest department, said though the government issued a gazette declaring it as sanctuary, the bridge authority was yet to hand over the area to them.
""We are in touch with the bridge authority. Once the river training work is done, they will hand over the area to us,"" he said.
The Munshiganj office of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) in a letter sent to its higher authorities in August said that the dredging was violating the Sand Quarries and Earth Management Act-2010.  The law stipulates that the slope of the river bed should be preserved during sand mining and it has to be ensured that river bed uniform level is not harmed.
The extraction should be done following the swing method to maintain the uniform level of the river bed, read the letter.
It also added that the amount of sand to be extracted was not mentioned by the bridge authority, which gives the dredgers the scope for unbridled sand mining. This could change the river's morphological character.
Asked about the BIWTA's objections, an official of the Padma Bridge Authority refused to make any comment.

As a Bangladeshi woman and a scientist, she has become a role model for the female population daring to chase after their dreams in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).The young scientist is currently residing in the UK, working as a synthetic chemist for Evonetix, a Cambridge-based synthetic biology company focused on developing DNA synthesis technology.In a casual interview with The Daily Star, the chemist opened up about her experience of working in STEM.Raysa's family moved to Sweden when she was quite young and she completed her education there. ""Chemistry invoked my curiosity from my high-school days,"" said the scientist. ""I had an amazing chemistry teacher, Dr Tammara Elmfors, who inspired me to pursue higher level education on the subject.""She graduated as the top student in her class, earning a Bachelor's Degree in Medical and Pharmaceutical Chemistry from Nottingham Trent University in 2014. In 2018, she completed her PhD in Medical Chemistry from the University of Sussex.The young scientist is currently residing in the UK, working as a synthetic chemist for Evonetix, a Cambridge-based synthetic biology company focused on developing DNA synthesis technology.
""Once we went to visit a six-year-old cousin of ours in Bangladesh, whose mom told him that there's a scientist amongst the two of us,"" shared Nazmus Sakib Tareque, Country Manager UK, Equality Check, and Raysa's husband. ""He assumed that the scientist was me rather than Raysa. But when I cleared his misunderstanding, he couldn't believe that a woman could also be a scientist.""



""People usually assume that being a scientist is a man's job,"" added Raysa. ""Even in the UK, there are fewer women in the upper spectrums of STEM.""
""It's often easier to accept and acknowledge something when you have a role model to broaden your horizon,"" shared Raysa.

/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/errant-cops-leniency-lends-them-impunity-3134656,Errant cops: Leniency lends them impunity,"Complaints about police's involvement in various crimes continue to pile up thanks to lenient disciplinary measures that embolden errant cops, say criminologists and legal experts. The complaints range from extortion, abduction, and torture, to bribery, drug dealing, framing people and unlawful detention. The offenders inside the force range from the ranks of superintendent of police to constables.Police themselves investigate allegations against its members and mete out departmental punishments to many, while a few also face criminal charges.Yet, their involvement in crimes continue because the punishments of police personnel often do not match the severity of their crimes or offences, said experts.""Somehow the offenders [in police] are getting spared and so, they are becoming repeat offenders,"" said Omar Faruk, a professor of the criminology and police science department at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University.He said unless there is media coverage of these incidents, action is seldom taken against offenders or they are dealt with leniently.""Only one or two incidents that make headlines, get the attention [of police]. That is why they can't come out of the deviation.""He said a huge number of police at field level are involved in crimes, but proper disciplinary action is not taken against them or only taken on a limited scale. Punishment under the existing laws is also not being ensured, he added.Departmental actions are taken only in name, like transfers, suspension of promotion, he said, adding, ""The offenders should be punished under the criminal justice system through departmental investigation.""Prof Faruk also suggested setting up an independent and neutral commission, like the ones that exist in developed countries, to try complaints against police.Around 9.6 percent of the force of 2.13 lakh law enforcers faced departmental action in 2021 alone, according to data the Bangladesh government provided to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on May 12, 2022.From 2015 to 2021, that number was 1.17 lakh or 55 percent of the total force. At least 1,692 criminal cases were filed against members of the force during that period.In 2021, a total of 17,966 members faced minor action like warnings, reprimands, or temporary wage cuts, and 2,388 faced major consequences like termination, suspension or demotions, according to the data.But the consequences of departmental action often pale in comparison to the benefits that corrupt members can get by abusing their power.For example, a constable who has been working at a police unit in Dhaka faced major departmental action twice in two years for taking money from people promising them jobs in the police department, said a police official wishing anonymity.The constable is now under investigation for a similar crime, the police official added.Another constable, Nafidul Islam, was suspended on charge of ration card forgery when he was posted in Rajarbagh Police Lines a few years back.In September last year, Shahjahanpur police arrested Nafidul along with another member of police and three others on charges of abduction and demanding ransom.Some victims of the crimes committed by police have alleged that they are yet to see any effective action despite submitting complaints to a complaint cell introduced by Police Headquarters (PHQ) in November 2017.The Daily Star talked to two such victims recently. One was falsely implicated by a team of Detective Branch (DB) of police in 2016, while another was tortured by a police team of DMP in 2019.They said considering the extent to which the offenders abused their power, only token departmental action was taken against them.When they moved to the court seeking justice, they faced various obstructions from the accused police members, they said, asking not to be named.All of this has resulted in an erosion of people's confidence in the police force. A recent survey commissioned by Bangladesh Police shows that over 73 percent of victims of various crimes did not report the crime.The reasons behind the non-reporting, according to the survey conducted between January and December 2018, include inconvenience victims face while filing a case and appearing in court, unfriendly attitude of police, and ""monetary involvement"" (the term the survey used).PHQ's Deputy Inspector General (Operations) Haider Ali Khan, however, claimed that very few members of the 2.13-lakh force get involved in criminal offences.""Since we are in uniform, crimes by police personnel draw attention. When any policeman commits any crime, we do not suppress it. We take proper punitive actions,"" he told The Daily Star.He said they always instruct and brief field-level police personnel and warn them about the punishment they would face if they were involved in any crime.""If any allegation is found against any member of the force, the allegation is probed properly. If the member is found guilty, departmental action is taken and even criminal cases are filed if he or she commits criminal offences,"" he said.Asked why, despite such actions, police personnel are still involved in crimes, the DIG said he thinks as police always deal with criminals, some members get influenced by them.More than a dozen incidents involving police officials in various crimes made headlines in the last few months.Take, for instance, the case of Assistant Sub-Inspector Mahbubul Alam of Pallabi police.On September 6, he planted yaba pills into the pocket of a pedestrian and showed him arrested in a narcotics case in the capital's Khilkhet area. Later, Alam and his two informants were arrested for framing the man.Constable Kamruzzaman and his seven accomplices were arrested on September 12 for looting 98 tolas of gold from a jewellery shop worker in Keraniganj.On July 17, Jahidul Islam, an ASI of Rupnagar Police Station, and his four associates were arrested for snatching 38 tolas of gold ornaments from a jewellery shop worker in the capital's Gabtoli area.The ASI was a member of SI Masudur Rahman's team who were involved in various crimes in the area. Last year on August 19, a woman in Dhaka's Rupnagar area alleged that Masudur took Tk 2.5 lakh from her home during a drive.On July 8, Rab arrested four people, including a constable of the special branch of Chattogram Metropolitan Police with 5,260 yaba pills.Of all the incidents, the suspension of Banani inspector Sheikh Sohel Rana, the so-called patron of e-commerce platform E-orange which made headlines for reportedly embezzling crores of taka by not delivering customers' products, was the talk of the country.Besides, six police personnel, including two officials of Rajshahi Metropolitan Police, were closed after a complaint against them was lodged for extorting money from two people by threatening to frame them in drug cases.Prof Omar Faruk said police culture has deviated from ensuring safety of the public and stopping crimes.Field-level police personnel in most cases demand bribes to file cases, take money from victims and act according to politically connected or influential people's bidding while registering cases and making arrests. Police officials also get transferred or promoted in exchange for bribes, he added.""Whatever innovations or strategies police take, they will not be able to overcome the image crisis as long as people are not getting the services,"" he said.Recruitment, transfer, and promotion in the police department have to be done fairly and transparently, he said.Former inspector general of police Nurul Huda said some undesirable people, who cannot resist temptation, are getting jobs in the force, and the bad elements are not being properly dealt with at different levels.Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman thinks a lack of effective accountability beyond departmental action, which is often not a sufficient deterrent, is increasing the risk of converting the institution to protect and enforce law into violators of law.That is not to say that there are no examples of pro-poor policing, but those are few compared to the widespread allegations of abuse of power, he told this newspaper.He said people at large are increasingly losing confidence in police as the first and principal port of call for rule of law and justice.""The police can get away with a culture of secrecy with regard to reports on investigations of police crime because of an apparent sense of confidence that the political authority also does not care much about the accountability of police,"" he added.""On the contrary, the deficit of accountability is often politically colluded and protected to serve short-term mileage. The resulting syndromes of dysfunctionality is ominous for law enforcement agencies as an institution as well as for the future of democracy in the country,"" Iftekharuzzaman said.Referring to cases where police plant narcotics on innocent people, Supreme Court lawyer Barrister Jyotirmoy Barua said such incidents indicate a flawed chain of command as well as a fragile law and order situation.""Law and order must operate objectively to ensure no innocent is punished. This can uphold the judicial equilibrium, but we have failed in many cases,"" he told this newspaper.""Punitive actions are supposed to set an example that deters others from committing crimes and in a true sense such examples could not be set."""
/business/economy/news/three-factors-holding-back-economy-3134446,Three factors holding back economy,"The interest rate cap on loans, the frequent changes to the exchange rate regime and a relaxed attitude to enforcing austerity measures are the major challenges facing Bangladesh in restoring stability in the economy. On several occasions in the last couple of months both the government and the Bangladesh Bank have claimed that the foreign exchange market will become stable within two to three months. But in reality, the situation is getting complicated with each passing day.The latest blow came last month when remittance and export receipts fell significantly whereas higher import bills, which have been at the heart of the pain facing the economy, have deepened the stress.The poor show of the three major indicators of the economy brought the foreign exchange reserves further down: It stood at $36.44 billion on September 28, down 6.7 per cent from August 31 and 21.25 per cent from a year ago.In order to curb inflation, which has been running high for several months for higher commodity prices and energy costs and US dollar shortages, the central bank asked banks to receive the full amount in advance from importers while opening letters of credit for consumer goods. But import payments have not declined as expected.The BB has also increased its key interest rate thrice since May, raising it to 5.75 per cent, in keeping with the stance the central banks around the world are following.The key interest rate, which is termed repurchase agreement (repo) in Bangladesh, determines the interest rate on both deposits and loans in the banking system. Banks also take short-term loans from the central bank quoting the rate.A higher repo rate is supposed to make funds costlier, which, in turn, will discourage borrowers from taking loans.The BB has maintained a 9 per cent interest rate cap since April 2020 at the instruction of the government, paving the way for the availability of cheaper funds for borrowers.Economists have been mostly unanimous in calling for the withdrawal of the ceiling in order to reduce the money supply since inflation has gone up and imports escalated. But the central bank has not paid heed to the suggestions. Subsequently, the country's private sector credit growth swelled to 14.07 per cent in August, reaching the touching distance of the BB's target of 14.10 per cent set for the whole fiscal year.Central banks usually raise the repo rate to reduce the money supply in order to contain inflation, but BB's repo rate hike is not working at all thanks to the interest rate cap.Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office, says that inflation could have been tackled had the BB withdrawn the interest rate cap.In July, inflation fell to 7.48 per cent from a nine-year high of 7.56 per cent in June. The government has not published the figure for August and September.A withdrawal of the interest rate cap can also help rein in import payments as it would discourage borrowers from importing more.But in reality, overall import payments swelled 26.5 per cent year-on-year to $20.69 billion in the first three months of the fiscal year.The central bank has seemed to be in a quagmire while setting the exchange rate of the taka against the dollar since volatility hit the foreign exchange market.The BB had followed a fixed exchange rate for a long time to ensure a stronger local currency, albeit artificially. But such a stance has come under pressure once reserves started depleting to keep the wheels of the economy moving.In June, the BB decided to move towards a floating exchange rate when remittances started to decline sharply. It later backpedalled when the taka lost its value sharply against the dollar.The US dollar traded at Tk 105.20 on October 2, up 23 per cent year-on-year.On September 12, banks were allowed to set the exchange rate under the guidance of the central bank.""The repeated changes to the exchange rate regime have adversely affected the remittance flow,"" Hussain said.Despite a surge in the outflow of migrant workers, remittances declined 11 per cent year-on-year to $1.54 billion in September, the lowest in seven months. Migrant workers sent home more than $2 billion each month between July and August.""There is no reason for the remittance to fall in September as a record 7.84 lakh migrant workers left the country for jobs abroad in the first eight months of this year,"" said Hussain.Experts blame the hundi, an illegal cross-boundary financial transaction system, for the falling remittance.Expatriate Bangladeshis used to get as high as Tk 115 for each dollar if they sent the money through the official channel. But as per a decision taken by banks last month, no lender now offers more than Tk 108 for a dollar from foreign exchange houses, which facilitate remittance transfers.""The central bank should follow a uniform exchange rate instead of multiple fixed exchange rates,"" said Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh.""If the fluctuation in the exchange rate regime persists, the remittance flow will continue facing difficulties.""In addition, exchange houses might not have remitted the money immediately so that the foreign exchange market faces further volatility and they can gain from the situation.He hopes remittance flow would accelerate within a few months if a proper policy action is taken.""Law enforcement agencies should take strict actions against the people involved in hundi,"" said Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue. Although the government earlier took various initiatives to implement austerity measures, no significant progress to this end is visible.The country has been enforcing power outage since July to save diesel amid its spike in price globally, in a bid to cut consumption and save US dollars. It has also stopped importing liquefied natural gas, sending the supply of natural gas low amid inadequate domestic generation.  But since factories are facing more than 10 hours of load-shedding nowadays, many manufacturers have turned to diesel owing to a lower pressure of gas and power supply, said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, on Sunday. As a result, the consumption of diesel has increased, he said.Zahid Hussain urged the government to stop the implementation of development projects funded by the domestic resources.This is because a large amount of US dollars is required to implement such projects and it is mobilised from the local source. Although the government had earlier taken a decision not to implement such projects, adequate action is not visible.""Austerity measures are also important for the private sector,"" said Mansur."
