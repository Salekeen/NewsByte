/shout/news/taorem-sananu-wins-the-thesis-the-year-golden-award-arcasia-3134886,Taorem Sananu wins the Thesis of the Year Golden Award at ARCASIA ,"Taorem Sananu, an Architecture student at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) won a gold medal at the Architects Regional Council Asia (ARCASIA) and represented Bangladesh in the annual global conference held in Mongolia. The ARCASIA consists of members from 22 Asian countries and is an extension of their institute's regional programmes and relations. They organise several architectural competitions and seminars, intending to unite architects in this region and provide them with a platform to maintain professional networks. It is a worldwide forum for ARCASIA member countries and architecture schools to display talent and ideas, to boost the quality of architectural education in Asia as a whole. It appreciates the idea of honouring thesis work from graduating students to create the ground for cross-border sharing of educational methods in the field of architecture.Students are encouraged to submit their final year thesis and the top three projects are forwarded to the Institute of Architects of Bangladesh (IAB). These are selected as the winners of the national round and are submitted to ARCASIA. Finally, three thesis projects are honoured with the Thesis of the Year (TOY) Award. ""Winning this prestigious award has been an amazing experience and nothing short of a dream come true. I enjoyed the ceremony and made friends with people from diverse cultural backgrounds,"" shared Taorem Sananu.Sananu, who hails from Homerzan Village in Moulvibazar, was the youngest member of team Bangladesh. She participated in the conference wearing the traditional clothes of the Manipuri community, thereby staying true to her roots.  Her thesis, entitled ""Blurring the Line"", focused on rejuvenating entrepreneurial potential to develop the socio-economic scenario of urban slums. This project was supervised by Dr Khandaker Shabbir Ahmed, Professor, and Md. Mizanur Rahman, Assistant Professor, of the Department of Architecture, BUET.The flexibility of slums combined with the static nature of urban structures tends to create a fine line that distinguishes the two areas. This conspicuous divide is just a reflection of the contrast between urban poor and city inhabitants, which is ultimately the result of more significant economic and social inequalities between these populations. The differences in economic level lead to a difference in social standing, which results in the tangible segregation of this demographic of people. Such economic, social, and physical barriers have hampered the expansion of the slums, leaving little room for socioeconomic progress and eventually forcing them to become a burden to the development of the city.Sananu's project addresses this problem by harnessing the spirit of slum entrepreneurs, from the Sattala slum. In her model, economic redevelopment is achieved by redistributing this existing market layout and integrating entrepreneur-friendly approaches within the existing scenario. She designed three types of modules, all at different thresholds, to blur all sorts of lines thereby, constructing an interdependent relationship between these two communities.Maisha Islam Monamee is a student of IBA, DU, and a freelance journalist who likes reading, scribbling, and blogging.

/business/economy/news/three-factors-holding-back-economy-3134446,Three factors holding back economy,"The interest rate cap on loans, the frequent changes to the exchange rate regime and a relaxed attitude to enforcing austerity measures are the major challenges facing Bangladesh in restoring stability in the economy. On several occasions in the last couple of months both the government and the Bangladesh Bank have claimed that the foreign exchange market will become stable within two to three months. But in reality, the situation is getting complicated with each passing day.The latest blow came last month when remittance and export receipts fell significantly whereas higher import bills, which have been at the heart of the pain facing the economy, have deepened the stress.The poor show of the three major indicators of the economy brought the foreign exchange reserves further down: It stood at $36.44 billion on September 28, down 6.7 per cent from August 31 and 21.25 per cent from a year ago.In order to curb inflation, which has been running high for several months for higher commodity prices and energy costs and US dollar shortages, the central bank asked banks to receive the full amount in advance from importers while opening letters of credit for consumer goods. But import payments have not declined as expected.The BB has also increased its key interest rate thrice since May, raising it to 5.75 per cent, in keeping with the stance the central banks around the world are following.The key interest rate, which is termed repurchase agreement (repo) in Bangladesh, determines the interest rate on both deposits and loans in the banking system. Banks also take short-term loans from the central bank quoting the rate.A higher repo rate is supposed to make funds costlier, which, in turn, will discourage borrowers from taking loans.The BB has maintained a 9 per cent interest rate cap since April 2020 at the instruction of the government, paving the way for the availability of cheaper funds for borrowers.Economists have been mostly unanimous in calling for the withdrawal of the ceiling in order to reduce the money supply since inflation has gone up and imports escalated. But the central bank has not paid heed to the suggestions. Subsequently, the country's private sector credit growth swelled to 14.07 per cent in August, reaching the touching distance of the BB's target of 14.10 per cent set for the whole fiscal year.Central banks usually raise the repo rate to reduce the money supply in order to contain inflation, but BB's repo rate hike is not working at all thanks to the interest rate cap.Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office, says that inflation could have been tackled had the BB withdrawn the interest rate cap.In July, inflation fell to 7.48 per cent from a nine-year high of 7.56 per cent in June. The government has not published the figure for August and September.A withdrawal of the interest rate cap can also help rein in import payments as it would discourage borrowers from importing more.But in reality, overall import payments swelled 26.5 per cent year-on-year to $20.69 billion in the first three months of the fiscal year.The central bank has seemed to be in a quagmire while setting the exchange rate of the taka against the dollar since volatility hit the foreign exchange market.The BB had followed a fixed exchange rate for a long time to ensure a stronger local currency, albeit artificially. But such a stance has come under pressure once reserves started depleting to keep the wheels of the economy moving.In June, the BB decided to move towards a floating exchange rate when remittances started to decline sharply. It later backpedalled when the taka lost its value sharply against the dollar.The US dollar traded at Tk 105.20 on October 2, up 23 per cent year-on-year.On September 12, banks were allowed to set the exchange rate under the guidance of the central bank.""The repeated changes to the exchange rate regime have adversely affected the remittance flow,"" Hussain said.Despite a surge in the outflow of migrant workers, remittances declined 11 per cent year-on-year to $1.54 billion in September, the lowest in seven months. Migrant workers sent home more than $2 billion each month between July and August.""There is no reason for the remittance to fall in September as a record 7.84 lakh migrant workers left the country for jobs abroad in the first eight months of this year,"" said Hussain.Experts blame the hundi, an illegal cross-boundary financial transaction system, for the falling remittance.Expatriate Bangladeshis used to get as high as Tk 115 for each dollar if they sent the money through the official channel. But as per a decision taken by banks last month, no lender now offers more than Tk 108 for a dollar from foreign exchange houses, which facilitate remittance transfers.""The central bank should follow a uniform exchange rate instead of multiple fixed exchange rates,"" said Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh.""If the fluctuation in the exchange rate regime persists, the remittance flow will continue facing difficulties.""In addition, exchange houses might not have remitted the money immediately so that the foreign exchange market faces further volatility and they can gain from the situation.He hopes remittance flow would accelerate within a few months if a proper policy action is taken.""Law enforcement agencies should take strict actions against the people involved in hundi,"" said Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue. Although the government earlier took various initiatives to implement austerity measures, no significant progress to this end is visible.The country has been enforcing power outage since July to save diesel amid its spike in price globally, in a bid to cut consumption and save US dollars. It has also stopped importing liquefied natural gas, sending the supply of natural gas low amid inadequate domestic generation.  But since factories are facing more than 10 hours of load-shedding nowadays, many manufacturers have turned to diesel owing to a lower pressure of gas and power supply, said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, on Sunday. As a result, the consumption of diesel has increased, he said.Zahid Hussain urged the government to stop the implementation of development projects funded by the domestic resources.This is because a large amount of US dollars is required to implement such projects and it is mobilised from the local source. Although the government had earlier taken a decision not to implement such projects, adequate action is not visible.""Austerity measures are also important for the private sector,"" said Mansur."

/daily-star-books/news/fanfiction-and-the-art-retelling-stories-3134831,Fanfiction and the art of retelling stories,"The term 'fanfiction', self-explanatory enough, describes amateur fiction pieces written by a fan, based on popular literary works. Its writers are devoted members of their respective fandomsbe it books, television shows, a film franchise, or a video game; these fans spend considerable amounts of time revisiting the universes of their favourite characters. So much so, that continuing the narrative to their own liking becomes the next logical step. Despite the great effort that often goes into these works, writers do not really emphasise on putting it through a publication process; they are mainly published on online platforms like Wattpad, and shared via their personal social media accountsshould they choose to circulate it. In commercially published works, there is always a name, a face and biography attached to the book; book-signings and interviews take place where the readers can glimpse at the person behind the work.Fanfiction writers, in contrast, mostly write their content incognito: their profiles are devoid of their photos and their real names hidden behind aliases. So the questions remain: Why do they take such great efforts to create new, additional plot-points and storylines of content that have already been sufficiently discussed and explored by the original creators themselves? Why not develop their own new story/universe? Why put in so many hours into writing about someone else's work? To appreciate the 'fanfic' writer, one must understand how a fan's mind works. Fans are not just passive consumers. They do not finish reading a book or watching a show and move on with their lives. Instead we spend hours reimagining scenes, wondering about other possibilities and contemplating pivotal moments from within the fictional world that we have grown to love. And sometimes, in our obsessive devotion, we let our minds run wild, and this is why we create fan-clubs, the existence of which often prompts activities such as cosplaying and multi-day fan conventions and expositions. And when our imaginations continue to overflow with possibilities and our minds keep churning out newer ideas about the source material, the only way forward is to write it all down. I believe fanfiction is written for a number of reasons. Some fans want to explore other possibilities by expanding on certain ideas from the source material that they most cherish. Others seek to answer questions that were left unexplored, and many others seek to change elements in the story to result in an ending to their satisfaction. Some ambitious fans want to explore the possibilities of combining two or more franchises to form crossovers. Personally, my mind has often wondered what would have happened if Nina Zenik and Matthias Helvar from Six of Crows escaped to Novyi Zem instead of coming back to Ketterdam, or how the story of Lord of the Rings would have progressed if Boromir managed to snatch the ring from Frodo. These are questions that can only be answered by fanfiction writers. No matter how many reasons there are for writing fanfiction, they all intimately coalesce into a simple fact: fanfiction is written and read because it allows fans to spend a little extra time with the characters they have grown to adore. What fan would not want to prolong their time within a story surrounded by the fictional characters, whose joys and struggles have moved them, characters that they have rooted for and characters that they have lost? Despite this kind of sincere devotion, many critics dismiss fanfiction writers as being too lazy or lacking in active imagination, stemming from the concern that the content is based on borrowed characters and plots (even though all fanfiction comes with a disclaimer that gives all content ownership to the original creators). Simply explained, fanfiction is just a devoted fan's mind asking, ""What if?"" The genre means that the author or the creator of the fictional work has touched the hearts of their fans, it means that they have given their fans hope and vision, causing positive ripples in their lives. Fanfiction is the greatest love letter a work of art can receive from a fan.Sameirah Nasrin Ahsan is a mechanical engineer in Dhaka. She aspires to be an author someday.

/nrb/news/ransom-paid-bangladeshi-abducted-malaysia-yet-be-freed-3134746,Ransom paid but Bangladeshi abducted in Malaysia yet to be freed,"A 39-year-old Bangladeshi expatriate, who was abducted in Malaysia on September 25, 2022, was not released even after the payment of Tk 5 lakh ransom.Victim Sohel Miah's family members have lodged complaints with Bangladesh and Malaysia police stations as he remains traceless for nine days.Sohel, son of late Ahmed Miah of Dakshin Dhalapara village in Ghatail upazila of Tangail, has been working in a factory in Malaysia for over 15 years.According to Sohel's neighbours in Malaysia, the abductors picked him up from in front of his home in Tamiljaya neighborhood of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, on September 25 at 9pm (local time).Mizan, another Bangladeshi expatriate and next-door neighbour of Sohel, said, ""On the day of the incident, the victim came from work and spoke to his mother on mobile phone before going down. He was picked up from in front of his house by the abductors.""On September 28, Sohel's brother-in-law, Billal Hossain, filed a complaint with Ghatail Police Station in Tangail in this regard.On the other hand, Hashem Ahmed, a relative of Sohel and also a Malaysian expatriate, filed a complaint with Johor Bahru Police Station in Malaysia on October 2, 2022.According to the complaint lodged with the police stations, Billal received a call from a Malaysian number on September 25. Abductors threatened that if he doesn't pay Tk 5 lakh, Sohel will be killed. The next morning at 10 am, Sohel called him from the same number and said, ""If you don't send the money quickly, they will kill me"".Where or to whom should the money be sent? -- When asked, another Bangladeshi took the phone from Sohel and gave the account number of an organisation named Kulpatoa Poultry Feed under Janata Bank Barishal branch and asked Billal to send the ransom there.The family of Sohel quickly raised the ransom money by taking a loan. The funds were then deposited to the bank account provided by the abductors on September 27.A money receipt for Tk 5 lakh was sent to the abductors' WhatsApp account on the same day. The kidnappers responded with ""OK"" from the other end.However, the phone number is now switched off and there has not been any communication since that time.Contacted, Nazmus Sadat Selim, minister (labour) of Bangladesh High Commission in Malaysia, said the high commission is not aware of the abduction. So far, no written complaints have been received yet. The High Commission will act quickly if it receives a complaint, he added."
/news/world/news/why-svante-paabo-won-2022-nobel-prize-medicine-3134761,Why Svante Paabo won 2022 Nobel Prize in medicine?,"Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for discoveries that underpin our understanding of how modern day people evolved from extinct ancestors at the dawn of human history.Paabo's work demonstrated practical implications during the COVID-19 pandemic when he found that people infected with the virus who carry a gene variant inherited from Neanderthals are more at risk of severe illness than whose who do not.Paabo, director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, won the prize for ""discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution,"" the Award committee said.""The thing that's amazing to me is that you now have some ability to go back in time and actually follow genetic history and genetic changes over time,"" Paabo told a news conference at the Max Planck Institute. ""It's a possibility to begin to actually look on evolution in real time, if you like.""Paabo, 67, said he thought the call from Sweden was a prank or something to do with his summer house there.""So I was just gulping down the last cup of tea to go and pick up my daughter at her nanny where she has had an overnight stay,"" Paabo said in a recording posted on the Nobel website.""And then I got this call from Sweden and I of course thought it had something to do with our little summer house ... I thought the lawn mower had broken down or something.""Asked if he thought he would get the award, he said: ""No, I have received a couple of prizes before but I somehow did not think that this really would qualify for a Nobel Prize.""Paabo, son of a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, has been credited with transforming the study of human origins after developing ways to allow for the examination of DNA sequences from archaeological and paleontological remains.Not only did he help uncover the existence of a previously unknown human species called the Denisovans, from a 40,000-year-old fragment of a finger bone discovered in Siberia, his crowning achievement is considered to be the methods developed to allow for the sequencing of an entire Neanderthal genome.'GENETIC DIFFERENCES'This research, which showed that certain genes of Neanderthal origin are preserved in the genomes of people today, was once considered impossible, given that Neanderthal DNA on bones has shrivelled up over thousands of years into short fragments that have to be assembled like a gigantic puzzle, and are also heavily contaminated with microbial DNA.""This ancient flow of genes to present-day humans has physiological relevance today, for example affecting how our immune system reacts to infections,"" the Nobel Committee said.The prize, among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is awarded by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden's Karolinska Institute and is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($900,357).It is the first of this year's batch of prizes.Born in Stockholm, Paabo studied medicine and biochemistry at Uppsala University before creating a scientific discipline called ""paleogenomics"", which helped show genetic differences that distinguish living humans from extinct hominins.""His discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human,"" the Committee said.The COVID-19 pandemic has placed medical research centre stage, with many expecting that the development of the vaccines that have allowed the world to regain some sense of normality may eventually be rewarded.Still, it typically takes many years for any given research to be honoured, with the committees charged with picking the winners looking to determine its full value with some certainty amongst what is always a packed field of contenders.PANDEMICWhen asked why the prize did not go to advances in combating COVID, Thomas Perlmann, secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, said the committee would only talk about prize winners, not those who had not won, or had not yet won.However, Paabo's ancient forensics work did offer insight on why some people are at higher risk of severe COVID.In 2020, a report from Paabo and colleagues found that a gene variant inherited by modern humans from Neanderthals when they interbred some 60,000 years ago made those that carry the variant more likely to require artificial ventilation if infected by the COVID-causing virus.""We can make an average gauge of the number of the extra deaths we have had in the pandemic due to the contribution from the Neanderthals. It is quite substantial, it's more than one million extra individuals who have died due to this Neanderthal variant that they carry,"" Paabo said in 2022 lecture.Paabo's most cited paper in the Web of Science was published in 1989, with 4,077 citations, said David Pendlebury, from UK-based scientific data analytics provider Clarivate.""Only some 2,000 papers out of 55 million published since 1970 have been cited this many times,"" he said.""It is, however, not an award for a discovery relevant to clinical medicine, which many anticipated this year after a Nobel Prize focusing on physiology last year.""Past winners in the field include a string of famous researchers, notably Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin, and Robert Koch, who won already in 1905 for his investigations of tuberculosis."

/news/bangladesh/news/pm-hasina-leads-complex-roiling-nation-the-washington-post-3134796,"PM Hasina leads a complex, roiling nation: Washington Post","The Washington Post, the leading US daily newspaper, has highly lauded Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's strong leadership on the world stage alongside Bangladesh's tremendous progress of women, and achievements in education and poverty reduction.The appreciation came in an article published in the widely circulated newspaper on Monday, written by its columnist Petula Dvorak.The article was written based on an interview of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina taken by the writer at hotel Ritz-Carlton's ballroom in Northern Virginia recently.Highlighting success stories of the prime minister, Dvorak wrote, Sheikh Hasina is the longest-serving female head of government in the world.The article said, the prime minister is leading a nation with more people than Russia and has survived at least 20 assassination attempts including an especially bloody grenade attacks in 2004 thrown into the crowds around her.Referring to a man named Abdullah Niami, the writer said, he raised his 6-year-old daughter Zoya up high as he wanted her to witness the site of the Bangladeshi PM--a female head of government which America won't see anytime soon.The article also highlighted that Sheikh Hasina, as the nation's prime minister for four terms (18 years so far) is upholding the legacy of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.The article explained that Sheikh Hasina is a leader who leads a complex, roiling nation.At the UN General Assembly, it said, the prime minister asked for help with more than a million Rohingya refugees who have fled the violence in Myanmar and settled in camps in Bangladesh.Petula Dvorak quoted Sheikh Hasina as saying that camp life is not good and the Rohingyas want to return to their country.Her nation's migrant situation cannot be compared with America's, Hasina said, adding that America is a vast country where there are lots of lands, lots of space, opportunities to do work.Hasina said, Bangladesh ranks No. 8 in the world in population, with more than 171 million people, but its size is just like Wisconsin of the USA.The article also highly appreciated the Hasina government's zero-tolerance approach to domestic terrorism.Being a woman, the prime minister said, she understands more intimately the struggle of poverty and education in Bangladesh, the obstacles that most women face, and how their stagnation slows a nation's progress.In the past decade, her government significantly reduced poverty in the country, expanded educational opportunities and improved housing, she said.Sheikh Hasina also elaborated that Bangladesh makes housing a human right, even if they are simple structures of brick and corrugated steel roof.The houses are willed in the name of the man and the woman, she emphasised and said, if the couples split up, the woman keeps the house, and not the man.The article quoted the World Bank that gives high marks to growth in Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina's leadership, noting it went from ""being one of the poorest nations at birth in 1971"" to reaching ""lower-middle income status in 2015.""Besides, the article reads, under the leadership of the prime minister, investing in the women of Bangladesh through health care and housing helped elevate the nation."
/business/news/oil-prices-edge-3134801,Oil prices edge up,"Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as expectations that OPEC+ may agree to a large cut in crude output when it meets on Wednesday offset concerns about the global economy.Brent crude futures rose 46 cents, or 0.5 per cent, to $89.32 per barrel by 0629 GMT after gaining more than 4 per cent in the previous session.U.S. crude futures rose 30 cents, or 0.4 per cent, to $83.93 a barrel. The benchmark gained more than 5 per cent in the previous session, its largest daily gain since May.Oil prices rallied on Monday on renewed concerns about supply tightness. Investors expect that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known collectively as OPEC+, will cut output by more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) at their first in-person meeting since 2020 on Wednesday.Voluntary cuts by individual members could come on top of this, making it their largest cut since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, OPEC sources said. read more""Despite everything going on with the war in Ukraine, OPEC+ has never been this strong and they will do whatever it takes to make sure prices are supported here,"" said Edward Moya, a senior analyst with OANDA, in a note.OPEC+ has boosted output this year after record cuts put in place in 2020 due to demand destruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. But in recent months, the organisation has failed to meet its planned output increases, missing in August by 3.6 million bpd.""Whilst OPEC+ might announce a large cut (in excess of 1 million bpd), in reality, the cut could be much smaller. This is due to most OPEC+ members producing well below their target production levels,"" ING analysts said in a note.The production cut being considered was justified by the sharp decline in oil prices from recent highs, said Goldman Sachs, adding that this reinforced its bullish oil view. read moreConcerns about the global economy could cap the upside, said Tina Teng, an analyst at CMC Markets, as investors also look to take profit on gains made in the previous session.""Uncertainties remain in the global markets, such as bond market turmoil, the sell-off in risk assets, and a skyrocketing U.S. dollar,"" said Teng.Oil prices have dropped for four straight months as COVID-19 lockdowns in top oil importer China curbed demand while interest rate hikes and a soaring U.S. dollar pressured global financial markets. Major central banks have embarked on the most aggressive round of rate rises in decades, sparking fears of a global economic slowdown.U.S. crude oil stocks were estimated to have increased by around 2 million barrels in the week to Sept. 30, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday."
