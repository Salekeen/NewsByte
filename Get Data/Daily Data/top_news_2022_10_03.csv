/opinion/in-focus/news/gandhis-sojourn-noakhali-3133786,Gandhi’s sojourn in Noakhali,"There are many ways a nation's history can be understood, for it has many points, opinions, and arguments depending on the sources one can reach. To comprehend history, scholars have recently started turning to memories in their efforts to make sense of the past. On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on October 2, we can take the opportunity to examine the memories of his visit to Noakhali to remember the ""champion of non-violence.""Memories are being used as a tool to reconstruct the past, as much it was imagined as it transpired. This article is aimed at seeing Gandhi's visit through recollection, commemoration, and social manners and mores. It is a repertoire of interests, and collective mentality about the local history of India's partition. Gandhi's Noakhali visit in 1946 was rarely examined directly through collective memory, neglected as just a case study that fails to reveal the long-lasting legacy Gandhi left behind, as can be found in the oral recollections of the villagers in Noakhali.Gandhi's sojourn in Noakhali sparked many political debates and opinions, alleging him of downplaying the cause of the Muslims, who were victimised by the communal riots in Bihar that erupted immediately after the violence in Noakhali. However, Gandhi intended to heal the communal scars in the Muslim society in Noakhali, aiming to set an example for the rest of India of how Hindus and Muslims can get along. However, while relevant, the focus of this piece is not the political agenda of the time, but rather the local history of Noakhali during Gandhi's visit, and how he was mainly seen from the Muslim perspective and is still remembered in the community by people who had no political affiliations and ambitions.Hindu-Muslim relationships in Noakhali in late 1930s
Before delving into the memories of Gandhi's visit to Noakhali, let us have an overview of the Hindu-Muslim relationships in the area the decade before. The relationship took a hit when Khitish Babu, a schoolteacher in Lamchar, Noakhali, who happened to be Hindu, called his Class 7 student, who was Muslim, haramjada (bastard). This was an offensive to Muslims, especially coming from someone who was Hindu. Following that, a large meeting was called by Golam Sarwar, the local MLA and a Muslim political leader, in Lamchar on April 12, 1939. Sarwar protested this incident and was agitated about how Hindus dared rebuke a Mohammedan student with this filthy language. He asked for an apology from the school authorities and said he would go on a strike at the school otherwise. He further threatened the teacher by dragging him round the street with shoes around his neck – an unimaginable insult for a teacher.



A Congress leader from the Hindu community at the time, Monoranjan Chowdhury, wrote a letter to Gandhi regarding this communal propaganda spread by Sarwar, and requested him to take immediate steps. He was angry that Hindus in Noakhali were switching from Congress to Hindu Mahasabha. What wasn't mentioned in the letter was that the Congress leader had also made references and an allegation of Bengal Muslim leaders failing to check the communal tensions, which was featured in the local newspaper. One particular point the newspaper addressed was about Sandwip, Noakhali, where, for 12 years, an agreement was in place between the two communities. This agreement stated that Hindu processions could pass in front of mosques, playing music, except during prayer hours. In 1939, on the Bijaya Dashami Day, the local Hindus employed the agreement. But the sub-deputy collector and circle officer-in-charge wrote to Babu Rajendralal Nag, BL on October 21, 1939, ""I consider it my duty to let you know and you are probably aware that a civil tumult may arise if music is played near the mosque at any hour on the Dashera Day.""
""There was a time when Indian Musselman used to listen to me, but now (they) regard me as their enemy number one. I worked with the Ali brothers, Azmal Khan, and many others for years. I tell you; I am not an enemy of anybody on Earth. I am a servant of God, i.e. truth.""



There was an allegation about Krishak Samitis as well. Hindu leaders demanded for the appointment of a committee of inquiry to look into the cases of communal tensions and violence. In response, the then Home Minister Sir Nazimuddin insinuated that there was no precedent condition to such inquiry. He said all the issues they lamented about were false, baseless, and malicious – an attempt was made to malign this government without any reason whatsoever. He claimed that it was a ploy of Hindu zamindars and mahajans, whose illegal exactions had been checked by the Krishak Samitis of the district. No immediate response from Gandhi was found in 1939 concerning the problem, making it more difficult to assume whether he took time to go over the letters sent from Noakhali. However, he responded by visiting the district in 1946, indicating that he was aware of the situation and the growing differences between the two groups. To bring the community together during the riots and before partition, Gandhi travelled to Noakhali with his ""peace mission,"" an idea that can be used interchangeably with non-violence.

Remembering Gandhi
Memories endure only within the social context that they were created in, with communities largely defining the conceptual structures that individuals use to recall information. The socially acquired understanding of the past is a patchwork of personal reminiscences constructed and pieced together within this social dimension (Hayden White: 1987). Thus, the relationship between memory and an understanding of history through social context is one of mutual influence, both parts greatly effecting and relying upon the other. Regarding the individual memories of Gandhi, I took oral interviews in the places Gandhi visited in 1946. The attempt was to retrieve individual perspectives on Gandhi, which coalesced into an image. One of the people that I interviewed, Motalleb Patwary, who is now 88 years old with a round wrinkled face and a goatee, shared, ""There were no places left untouched by the rioters in Chandpur. While the whole place was aflame, there were no human casualties. Immediately after the riots, the Gurkha Army first came to our area. Then, Gandhi arrived with his two granddaughters, and his message was calming and noble. Gandhi spoke to the mass people in a comforting tone. Nothing was out of order. He tried to make the communities understand that we, Hindus and Muslims, were brothers. There was no point of fighting each other. We were trying to drive out the British rulers; while they were leaving, they made us fight one another."" Patwary and his maternal cousin joined Gandhi's prayer meetings. He also added that there was no one in the village who did not attend the meetings; everyone, young and old, was there.

As the interview went on, Patwary also mentioned, ""Everyone was waiting for him to come. There was a whole sea of people."" Despite the issue of riots which was what Gandhi was trying to address, Gandhi the individual became a hot topic in the community. Because of the poor communication system back then, the roads Gandhi travelled were renovated by filling ditches, and bridges were made where needed. An air of festivity had settled in the area. The news of his visit led to the resolution of a lot of issues. People who were forcefully converted to Islam became Hindu again. More importantly, the perpetrators of the riots went into hiding, while many of them went to apologise to the Hindus. Patwary's experience resonates with Tofael Ahamad, who was, then, a student at Chatkhil Panchgaon Government High School. He wrote in his book, ""'Let's go see Gandhi,'saying this, we ran"" [Mahatma Gandhi in Bangladesh (East Bengal), Dhaka: Panchgaon Prokashoni, 1992, P. 1-5]. He further described that it was not more than a quarter of a mile from his house where Gandhi came – a 10-minute walking distance. His aura was powerful, and it seemed like Ahmad needed to see him and attend his meeting. Even though he didn't like who Gandhi was and why he came, he still felt an urge to see him.
Gandhi's sojourn in Noakhali sparked many political debates and opinions, alleging him of downplaying the cause of the Muslims, who were victimised by the communal riots in Bihar that erupted immediately after the violence in Noakhali. However, Gandhi intended to heal the communal scars in the Muslim society in Noakhali.
Noni Bala Bonik was protected by her Muslim neighbours. She was 90 at the time of the interview, but had sharp and detailed memories on Gandhi. She recalled, ""Gandhi came like a messenger and set up some temporary camps. I attended his prayer meetings twice and received chocolates."" For Noni Bala and other Hindus, Gandhi appeared like a saviour after the riots, as everyone assumed that since he was around, nobody would have the courage to unleash violence again. After Gandhi's assassination, Noni Bala and her family members lived in anxiety for days fearing that riots may break out again. But nothing happened.
Whatever the Hindu or Muslim positions were in Noakhali seven decades ago, Gandhi was able to bring the community together. Sumit Sarkar defined it as Gandh's ""finest hour."" The principal of Chaumani College, Tafazzal Husain, equated Gandhi with a prophet. Gandhi wrote a letter to Husain and shared his emotion. ""There was a time when Indian Musselman used to listen to me, but now (they) regard me as their enemy number one. I worked with the Ali brothers, Azmal Khan, and many others for years. I tell you; I am not an enemy of anybody on Earth. I am a servant of God, i.e. truth. I shall stick to this job till I die, or someone kills me (Smritikana (Bits of Memory) (Dhaka: 1978), P. 83)"" His statement revealed the internal conflict he had been going through before the partition. He wanted to return to Noakhali after the partition and spend the rest of his life with the Muslim community. More importantly, he compared riots with cancer, which needed to heal before it spread to the whole body of Indian polity. He said prevention was better than cure. Noakhali gave him the opportunity to set an example of communal harmony for the entire Indian subcontinent.
 







Gandhi Monument at Joyag, Noakhali.
Gandhi's monument
The Gandhi Ashram Trust, a philanthropic organisation in Noakhali, built a monument to convey Mahatma Gandhi's legacy and memories to the next generation. One can see the 20-foot, white stone sculpture of Gandhi standing upon a plinth and welcoming visitors. He is shown holding a walking stick in one hand, his other hand gently at his side. The statue is surrounded by a gorgeous garden of all sorts of trees and foliage. The image is simple and inviting, while still conveying the power of Gandhi's presence. It was built to commemorate Gandhi and the history of riots in Noakhali. This monument connects us to the history and power of resistance to violence as well as a willingness to reject riots. It always sparks a conversation among people and a broader public image which unites the community.
A monument is the embodiment of memories, a place bridging different generations. It helps us rethink the past that it perpetuates. Moreover, it is a constant dialogue between past and present, based upon which we can make decisions for the future. Gandhi's monument in Noakhali reveals the past to which we belong and how to learn from it. It also speaks to the community's crisis, trauma, and grief. Gandhi's legacy will continue in Noakhali through his monument, and let people understand the flag of peace he sailed with on his journey throughout Noakhali.

The more the deforestation, the more the natural calamities,"" he added.Those involved with the facility said this centre will address the knowledge gap, lack of climate technologies and action research to create contextual solution to the climate crisis through engaging academia, researchers, affected communities, development practitioners and policy makers.The centre was built in an area of 30 acres and has five ecological zones, including a haor region, a dry region, Char areas, hilly areas and a coastal zone, illustrating the resilience mechanism of each zone.Climate expert Saleemul Huq told The Daily Star that there are different activities going on in different regions.One of the key features of the facility is that it has five different ecosystem zones in display, where one can easily get a picture of what kind of impact each zone is facing.""Global researchers will come here to see how we are coping with the impacts of climate change. They will share their knowledge and learn from our resilience strategies,"" he said.The state-of-art facility will mainstream the transformative community-led adaptation and climate risk reduction by accelerating innovation, capacity development and knowledge dissemination, said CCDB Executive Director Juliate Keya Malakar.""It is our dream that this centre will now start supporting us, the communities we work with, and the country, in shaping our common future in climate resilience and zero carbon emission pathways"", she said.The facility also has 70 practical technologies that are effective in adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction.It also accommodates a climate learning centre, digital theatre, exhibition zone, conference hall, library, research centre and young learners' zone within the 30-acre area.While visiting the facility, Thomas Hirsch, policy advisor from Climate and Development Advice, a Germany-based organisation, said Bangladesh is among the five most vulnerable nations in terms of climate change.""This facility was designed in a way to bring together different stakeholders to develop the solution that Bangladesh needs. This centre will be a hub of knowledge exchange not only in Bangladesh but also within South Asia. German and American scientists will come here to help find better solutions as well,"" he said.Petra Berner, director international (programme) of Bread for the World, said the idea of the centre was conceived in 2012 and it was a long journey to get here.""The idea behind building such a facility came from the ideas about what can be done to fight the impact of climate change. It will serve as a centre to connect the knowledge produced by the local community to the experts to strengthen the climate resilience mechanism,"" she said. The arrangement for a guided tour to take a look at the various zones can be availed by any visitor, she added."

Rony will be discharged from Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery after Puja.Earlier on, Rony was shifted from the High Dependency Unit (HDU) to a cabin. He is currently able to walk and eat properly. The doctors have been hopeful that they will be able to release him soon. However, Rony will still have to visit the hospital for regular checkups, due to the severity of his injuries.On September 16, Abu Hena Rony and four other policemen were severely burnt during a gas balloon explosion, at the anniversary celebration of Gazipur Metropolitan Police. The injured were initially taken to Gazipur Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmad Medical College Hospital. Rony and Zillur Rahman, a policeman, were later sent to Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery, as the severity of their burn injuries was much higher.On September 17, Dr Samanta Lal Sen—coordinator of Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery—informed The Daily Star that Rony had suffered 25 percent burns, while policeman Zillur Rahman had suffered 19 percent burns. They were both kept at the HDU after their wounds had been dressed. "

I do have an interest in politics but only as an artiste. And I'm a successful artiste, as I began my career at the age of 16. I have reached the present stage after a lot of struggle,"" Kangana told the reporters in New Delhi.She visited over 1,200 items gifted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that are on display as part of an e-auction that began on September 17.The 35-year-old actress said her politics would instead be reflected in her work. ""I don't have the capacity to start over in a new career, but I will always make good films keeping in mind my interest in politics.""She talked about her upcoming directorial project ""Emergency"", in which she essays the role of former Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.Kangana acknowledged that the movie's subject is controversial in nature and it was only due to the creative freedom fostered by the 'current government' that she could tackle the subject.""It is a controversial topic and I think nobody till date has had the liberty to openly tell this story. It is only possible now because the current government provides a certain protection and platform to actors..."" the actress said.""This (the Emergency) was an important phase of the country's history but no one had the guts to make a film on it.

/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/us-watching-processes-free-fair-polls-3133851,"US watching processes to free, fair polls","Out of the five largest economies in the world today, three -- China (2), Japan (3) and India (5) -- are in Asia. The robust economic growth of Asian giants, China in particular, is rapidly reshaping the global distribution of power. With the global power shifting to Asia, the world's number one power USA rushes to join the geopolitical game, in which Bangladesh too, is likely to get pulled into.   Peter D Haas, the new US ambassador, who has been openly critical of human rights violations, accountability of Rab, political violence, touched on a few thorny points in an exclusive written interview with The Daily Star recently.The Daily Star (DS): Based on the solid foundation built between the two countries over the last 50 years, how do you see the future relationship of Bangladesh and the US? What are the elements needed to improve the relationship?Peter Haas (PH): I am amazed at just how much Bangladesh has accomplished over these 50 years and proud of the support the United States has provided to the Bangladeshi people and its government. We have collaborated across many sectors, and I predict that over the next 50 years, our partnership will become even stronger.The United States will continue to work with Bangladesh and build on the progress we have made together in food security, health, and reducing poverty. We will also identify new and innovative approaches to address issues like climate change, promoting democratic principles, increasing trade, and sustaining Bangladesh's impressive economic growth.  I am extremely optimistic about our future together. DS: What is the latest US position, 10 months after the sanctions on Rab? Is Washington satisfied with the measures already taken by Dhaka?  Specifically, what more is required?PH: The US Department of Treasury is the lead agency for sanctions-related matters.  For that Department to consider lifting sanctions, there must be accountability (i.e., holding those involved with human rights violations accountable) and change. The nomination of a human rights-sanctioned individual (just-retired IGP Benazir Ahmed) to attend an international conference does not signal accountability or change.More broadly, let me emphasise, sanctions need not limit our relations or cooperation in other areas. The United States and Bangladesh have a broad relationship and deep cooperation in many areas, including trade, development, health, and security.DS: You have repeatedly spoken of fair and inclusive elections in Bangladesh as the Biden administration's key foreign policy focus is democracy and human rights.  Do you think that Bangladesh is going the right way ahead of the upcoming national elections in early 2024? Do you have any suggestions?PH: The United States believes the strength of a democracy rests in the ability of its people to make their voices heard. Our policy on the Bangladeshi elections -- or anywhere for that matter -- is that the people of the country should be able to choose their own government through free and fair elections, conducted in accordance with international standards. We do not support any political party.News reports of intimidation and political violence in Bangladesh are disturbing. Free and fair elections cannot take place in such an environment. We call on all parties to respect the rule of law and to refrain from violence, coercion, intimidation, or retribution. Moreover, for journalists to be able to cover the elections freely and fully, they must be protected from harassment and violence.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said she and her government want free and fair parliamentary elections. We welcome these words and look forward to understanding how the government will ensure free and fair processes. We support constructive actions Bangladesh can take, ahead of the polls, to carry out a credible process.DS: The US considers labour rights a very important issue.  Exactly, what are the labour issues that the US is concerned with, and where do you think reforms are needed?  What do you think is the overriding labour rights issue that Bangladesh needs to address?PH: Although Bangladesh has taken some initial steps to amend its labour laws, workers continue to be subjected to unfair labour practices, and they too often face retaliation when they complain or attempt to organise collectively for change.I note Bangladesh has adopted an occupation, health, and safety national plan and implemented remediation of some factories after the Rana Plaza tragedy. Yet, we continue to be concerned over workplace safety issues when we hear about deadly industrial incidents and workplace fires.Due to these labour rights issues, Bangladesh has been ineligible for the Generalised System of Preferences trade benefit. The lack of significant progress in this area prevents funding of development projects in Bangladesh by the US International Development Finance Corporation.The US and Bangladeshi governments meet several times a year to discuss the necessary changes to protect labour rights in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh government has indicated it is working to further amend its labour laws.  We are committed to supporting Bangladesh to improve its labour rights, including through targeted development assistance.DS: Bangladesh is paying a hefty price for the carbon pollution by global economic giants including the United States. Is there any prospect for US investment or cooperation in combating climate fallouts?PH: The United States applauds Bangladesh's leadership in addressing climate change and is a proud partner in addressing this problem.Earlier this year, the US embassy launched a $20 million project to protect critical forests and wetland areas in Bangladesh from degradation and help local communities develop long-term resilience to climate change. Our development programmes also strengthen resilience in communities most vulnerable to disasters or climate-related impacts -- including support for early warning systems and shelters to mitigate severe weather emergencies, as well as interventions like helping farmers adopt climate-smart agriculture techniques.DS: Stability in Asia has suddenly become a major concern as the Biden administration aggressively executes its new Indo-Pacific strategy. The common perception is that this geopolitical development has placed Bangladesh's traditional relationship with China under stress. Is a vibrant Sino-Bangla relationship an obstacle to a warm US-Bangladesh relationship?PH: The United States' vision for the Indo-Pacific is a free and open region comprised of nations that are independent, strong, prosperous, and secure. We also envision a region that is more resilient to global challenges like pandemics and climate change, and in which nations and peoples are more interconnected. This is a vision we share with many of our allies and partners, including Bangladesh.Let me be direct about the relationship between the United States and China by quoting President Biden at the UN General Assembly earlier this month. ""As we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader. We do not seek conflict. We do not seek a Cold War. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.""We know that many countries, including the United States, have vital economic and people-to-people ties with China that they want to preserve. Our engagement in the Indo-Pacific is not against any one country, nor is it designed to make anyone choose between countries. Instead, our engagement is about advancing a positive, shared vision for creating a region where all nations can thrive."

Some 42,000 tickets had been issued for a stadium designed to hold 38,000 people, he said.The incident was a ""dark day for all involved"", said FIFA, the governing body for world soccer, which has asked Indonesian football authorities for a report on the incident.Its safety regulations say firearms or ""crowd control gas"" should not be used at matches.A tearful Arema FC president Gilang Widya Pramana apologised on Monday to the victims of the stampede and said he took full responsibility for the disaster.""Lives are more precious than soccer,"" he told a news conference.In an address on Sunday, Pope Francis said he had prayed for those who have lost their lives and for the injured from the disaster.Police and sport officials have been sent to Malang to investigate an incident that ranks among the world's deadliest stadium disasters.""All those responsible should be held accountable for this disaster, regardless of their status or position,"" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch said on Monday."

/business/economy/news/exports-slip-after-13-months-3133661,Exports slip after 13 months,"Export earnings dropped 6.25 per cent year-on-year to $3.9 billion in September, the first fall in 14 months, as the cost-of-living crisis in the western countries took its toll on Bangladesh's main foreign currency earning sector.  The decline came as the garment shipment, which accounts for about 85 per cent of national exports, went down by 7.52 per cent to $3.16 billion in the month, according to data from the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).In September, woven exports slipped 5.66 per cent to $1.43 billion while knitwear shipments dipped 9 per cent to $1.73 billion.The contraction in export earnings came as European and American buyers continue to struggle amid higher consumer prices.Inflation in the 19-member eurozone surged to 10 per cent in September, the highest on records, owing to the soaring electricity and natural gas prices. In the US, the Consumer-Price Index rose 8.3 per cent in August from the same month a year ago.And exporters warned that the negative growth may continue for another one or two months because of the double-digit inflation in Europe and higher consumer prices in the US and the growing threat of the world falling into recession.Overall earnings in the July-September quarter were, however, up 13.38 per cent at $12.49 billion.Similarly, garment shipment rose 13.41 per cent to $10.27 billion during the three-month period. Of the amount, $5.64 billion came from the knitwear sector and $4.62 billion from the woven segment, up 9.40 per cent and 18.73 per cent respectively from the identical quarter a year earlier.The shipment of woven garment items has been displaying a strong rebound because of the improvement in the coronavirus pandemic situation as the people have returned to offices and are going out and attending social events.""We expect that the earnings from the garment sector will rebound strongly from December as international retailers and brands are confirming previously stalled orders,"" said Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA).International retailers and brands have put on hold the orders because of the price escalation of the raw materials and higher inflation caused by higher prices of essentials and energy costs for the Russia-Ukraine war.""However, the situation is improving thanks to a fall in the prices of petroleum products and cotton in international markets,"" Hassan said.Cotton prices fell to 80 to 84 US cents per pound last week from $1-$1.05. This led retailers and brands to begin confirming the orders. Moreover, a lot of orders are shifting from China to Bangladesh due to the dragging tension between China and the US.Hassan, however, said factories need simplified business processes and there has to be adequate supply of gas to cater for the work orders.In the quarter, the earnings from the jute and jute goods export increased by 15.71 per cent to $245.65 million, EPB data showed. Leather and leather goods export grew 20.87 per cent to $327.97 million.""The earnings from jute and jute goods have been rising because of the growing export of diversified and value-added goods,"" said Md Abul Hossain, president of the Bangladesh Jute Mills Association.Recently, local jute mills have started producing fine yarn, which has higher demand in the international markets, he said.Syed Nasim Manzur, president of the Leathergoods and Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association of Bangladesh, expects the earnings from the sector to cross $3 billion in the next three years and $5 billion in the next five years from $1.5 billion in the last fiscal year.Home textile exports grew 26.59 per cent to $353.48 million between July and September, and the shipment of non-leather footwear grew by 35.31 per cent to $125.34 million.However, frozen and live fish, agricultural products, pharmaceuticals, carpets, terry towels and furniture could not perform strongly in the quarter. "

And we want accountability, who is to blame?"" said 25-year-old Andika, who declined to give his last name.""We want justice for our fallen supporters,"" he said.Outside the Kanjuruhan stadium on Sunday evening, people held a vigil beneath the roaring lion statue -- the club's symbol -- to honour the victims.But fresh graffiti daubed on the walls of the stadium revealed bubbling anger towards the authorities.""My siblings were killed. Investigate thoroughly,"" read one message scrawled on the stadium's shutters, accompanied by a black ribbon and the date of the tragedy.""ACAB"", an acronym for ""all cops are bastards"", was sprayed on another wall.In Jakarta, hundreds of football fans gathered outside the country's biggest stadium in Jakarta late Sunday chanting ""murderer! murderer!"", singing songs in support of Arema FC and placing police tape on the complex's fence.Indonesian President Joko Widodo announced a probe into the incident, but rights groups said it should be independent and officers should be held accountable for using tear gas in a confined area.""We call on authorities to conduct a swift, thorough, and independent investigation into the use of tear gas at the stadium and ensure that those who are found to have committed violations are tried in open court,"" Amnesty International said in a statement.""This loss of life cannot go unanswered.""Indonesia's chief security minister Mahfud MD said Sunday the government ""will immediately take some measures to investigate if there is a legal violation or crime in the incident.""But the anger gathered pace online, with many posts critical of the police going viral in Indonesia.""Investigate thoroughly. Firing tear gas in a closed space full of humans is a serious violation,"" read one tweet that was liked 11,000 times.An online petition titled ""The police must stop using tear gas"" gathered nearly 6,000 signatures by Monday morning.The fallout came as more information emerged about the stampede, with Arema FC's Chilean football coach saying ""fans died in the arms of players"".""The boys passed by with victims in their arms,"" Javier Roca told Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser.""I think the police overstepped their mark.""Fan violence between rival groups is an enduring problem in Indonesia.Witnesses of Saturday's violence say fans of the home team Arema invaded the pitch after their loss to Persebaya Surabaya.Persebaya Surabaya supporters were not allowed to buy tickets to the game, due to the fear of violence.After the deadly stampede, Arema fans threw rocks at officers and torched vehicles including a police truck on the streets of Malang, according to the police.FIFA's president Gianni Infantino called the tragedy a ""dark day"" for football but stopped short of calling for any action by authorities.The world football governing body's safety guidelines prohibit the carrying of crowd control gas by police or stewards at pitchside.World football united to mourn the tragedy, with Spanish clubs holding a minute's silence and top teams across Europe sending their condolences online."
/news/bangladesh/politics/news/bcl-run-the-whim-joy-lekhak-3133871,"BCL run at the whim of Joy, Lekhak","Bangladesh Chhatra League has been running its organisational activities in an ""undemocratic"" manner for the most part of the last four years, much to the dismay of its leaders and activists.Ever since they became the president and general secretary of the central committee in 2019, Al Nahean Khan Joy and Lekhak Bhattacharjee have been making organisational decisions at whim and in violation of the charter, insiders said. Aggrieved BCL leaders allege the democratic practices within the organisation have been pushed into the back seat as the top leaders are running the student body arbitrarily.The organisation was not run like this in its golden years leading up to the 1971 Liberation War.Joy and Lekhak did not respond to repeated calls and text messages for comments.As per the BCL charter, the incumbent central committee must make preparations for holding a council to elect the next president and general secretary before its two-year tenure ends. But the current committee made no such move in the last four years.The duo also failed to form committees in at least 67 out of the 116 district units within the stipulated one-year time. In some districts, councils are pending for over 10 years.Barishal district unit, for example, was formed in 2011 and its tenure expired a decade ago. The tenure of the Dhaka University unit, one of the most influential units of BCL, expired in 2019.The two also did not hold a single bi-monthly meeting of the central committee. As a result, the central BCL leaders could not discuss any political matters and express their opinions or dissatisfactions over organisational issues.""There are no democratic practices within the Chhatra League. The president and general secretary make decisions on all matters without seeking opinions of the executive council. Other leaders in the committee have no roles except for occupying the posts,"" Sohan Khan, a vice-president of central BCL, told The Daily Star.Enraged by the top leaders' activities, a faction of central BCL leaders went to Awami League President Sheikh Hasina's Dhanmondi office on September 10 to submit a written complaint against Joy and Lekhak on various issues, including violation of the charter.But the office secretary refused to accept it. They waited there for hours and left after a senior AL leader committed to sitting with them on the matter at a convenient time.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is organisational chief of BCL, picked Joy and Lekhak as acting president and acting general secretary on September 14, 2019. She made the decision after the president and general secretary of the previous committee -- Rezwanul Haque Chowdhury Shovon and Golam Rabbani -- lost their posts following allegations of bribery and other controversies.Four months later, Hasina made them full-fledged president and general secretary.Under the BCL charter, its president and general secretary are elected every two years through direct votes of the councillors coming from across the country.'VIOLATION IS THE NORM'According to the BCL constitution, the organisation must operate in the light of its charter.Section 13 (Kha) of the BCL constitution limits the tenure of the central executive committee to two years, meaning the present committee has expired two years ago.A fresh council must be held within two years for the election of the next committee. However, if required, the two-year tenure can be extended by up to three months upon approval from the central committee members.""But the existing committee did not hold a fresh council nor officially extend its tenure,"" said a BCL vice-president, wishing anonymity.Theoretically, the current BCL committee has no mandate to run the organisation.The BCL vice-president said the previous six committees also occupied the posts for about four years.The central committee is not supposed to have more than 301 members. But in reality it has 700 members.""During the month of mourning [August], more than 500 people were included in the central committee without any scrutiny,"" reads the complaint prepared for submission to Sheikh Hasina.Sources said Joy and Lekhak handpicked them and made them members of the organisation simply by sending them letters to this effect.BCL leaders said the duo announced 13 committees of different units which include district, upazila, and university committees from July 6 to July 31. But it was done without holding any councils, which is a violation of its charter.""Violating the constitution has become a norm for the top leadership. We are very frustrated to see that an organisation like Chhatra League is being run like this,"" said a central BCL leader."

/sports/cricket/news/tigresses-suffer-nine-wicket-defeat-against-pakistan-3133946,Tigresses suffer nine-wicket defeat against Pakistan,"Bangladesh stumbled in their second match of Women's Asia Cup 2022 as Pakistan crushed the defending champions by nine wickets at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Monday. The Tigresses had a flying start of the campaign beating Thailand by nine wickets in their first match. However, they suffered a similar fate to Thailand as the title holders couldn't stand against Pakistan in their second match.Chasing a humble total of 71 in 20 overs, Bismah Maroof's troop comfortably reached the target. The opening 49-run stand between wicketkeeper batter Muneeba Ali and Sidra Ameen set the sail towards victory. Followed by Muneeba's departure in the eighth over by Salma Khatun, skipper Bismah Maruf and Sidra comfortably reached the target winning the game by nine wickets with 46 balls left to play. Earlier, Pakistan won the toss and sent Bangladesh to bat first. Pakistan captain Bismah's plans hit the jackpot as their bowling attack were all over their counterparts and didn't let the champions grow any form of resistance. A couple of wickets each from Dina Baig and Nida Dar while Sadia Iqbal and Omaima Sohail's solitary wickets each only led Bangladesh to score 70 runs off eight wickets in 20 overs. Skipper Nigar Sultana Joty scored a slow 17 off 30 balls while veteran batter Salma Khatun remained unbeaten on 24.

/news/bangladesh/politics/news/al-bnp-overdrive-woo-allies-3133856,"AL, BNP in overdrive to woo allies","The ruling Awami League and its arch-rival the BNP are working to bring like-minded political parties into their fold ahead of the next parliamentary election.As part of the move, the AL is trying to expand its alliance by taking the pro-liberation political forces on board. It is also taking steps to strengthen the 14-party alliance, insiders said.The BNP, on the other hand, is focused on waging a simultaneous movement with all the opposition forces. It has begun talks with like-minded parties so they could join hands and realise the demand for a neutral polls-time administration, BNP leaders said.Before the 2008 election, the AL formed a 14-party alliance with pro-liberation and left-leaning parties. At the same time, it formed a greater alliance including the Jatiya Party and participated in the polls.After the 2018 election, the relations between the AL and its partners in the 14-party alliance deteriorated because of the smaller parties' lack of representation in the government. Some of the allies were also vocal against the government on different issues.The main opposition in parliament, the Jatiya Party, was an electoral partner of the AL in the elections held in 2008, 2014 and 2018.The relations between the AL and JP have lately been strained as the former believes JP Chairman GM Quader has reached an understanding with the BNP leaders about a simultaneous anti-government movement, sources said.Last month, Quader said his party did not belong to any alliance with the AL.The ruling party is now working on its relations with the member parties of the 14-party combine and has already sat with them several times.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also had a meeting on March 15 with the partners of its ""ideological alliance"". Like the previous two elections, the AL will contest the 2024 national election under the banner of the 14-party alliance. The polls are slated for early 2024.Amir Hossain Amu, coordinator and spokesperson of the alliance, told The Daily Star that the AL is planning to expand the combine with the pro-liberation forces.""Our door is open for any democratic and pro-liberation party. Now we are trying to strengthen our relations with the alliance partners. We will organise some joint programmes in the coming days,"" he said.AL praesidium member and Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque also told The Daily Star that the party is trying to brush up on its communications with the like-minded and pro-liberation parties.It also plans to step up its political activities keeping in mind the BNP's series of programmes, insiders said.The ruling party, however, does not want to come up with any counter programme as the party leaders believe such programmes would only invite confrontations.Currently, the ruling party is holding grassroots conferences, and  it believes these conferences and new leaderships will help it boost its political activities across the country.But the party will resist the opposition on the streets if the BNP does  excesses in the name of anti-government movement, said party leaders.Talking to this paper, Razzaque said, ""The Awami League is not an opposition party. We will not take to the streets with political programmes.""AL General Secretary and Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader on Saturday said the BNP would face stiff resistance if it tried to create chaos.Meanwhile, the BNP started the second round of talks with the alliance and like-minded political parties to wage a simultaneous movement against the government. It held a meeting with the Bangladesh Kalyan party yesterday and reached an agreement on launching a movement for a neutral election-time government.In the first round of talks, the BNP leaders sat with 23 political parties including the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Rob), Nagorik Oikya, Biplabi Workers Party, and Gonosamhati Andolon.After the talks, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told reporters that in the first round of talks, the parties agreed on waging simultaneous movements. And in the latest round, the parties are finalising the issues and the demands that will be highlighted in the movement.""The BNP has drafted a number of demands for the movement and we have  agreed on those points,"" Syed Muhammad Ibrahim, chairman of Bangladesh Kalyan Party, told The Daily Star.He added that the BNP leadership wanted the movement to be simultaneous, not under an alliance.Fakhrul said that in the second round of talks, the BNP leaders would meet all the political parties, except the AL.The BNP is looking for simultaneous movements while keeping its 20-party alliance and Jatiya Oikya Front inactive.Sources said the BNP adopted this strategy keeping in mind the local and international reservations about the Jamaat-e-Islami, a key component of the alliance.BNP sources said the party faced widespread criticisms at home and abroad for its links to Jamaat, which is condemned for assisting the Pakistan occupation forces during the 1971 Liberation War.There has been pressure from within the BNP to cut ties with the Jamaat. Besides, other political parties earlier showed reluctance to be in a coalition with the BNP because of its relations with the Jamaat."

/business/economy/industries/tax-customes/news/nbr-may-extend-vat-cut-edible-oil-3133626,NBR may extend VAT cut on edible oil,"The National Board of Revenue (NBR) is likely to extend a value added tax reduction on edible oil imports and refining for three months to retain current prices for consumers battered by rising costs of essential commodities. The revenue administration is working on it and may issue a notification within a couple of days, said a senior NBR official.On March 16 this year, the NBR slashed the VAT on edible oil imports to 5 per cent from 15 per cent till June 30 to give some relief to consumers amid a public outcry against surging prices, slow delivery by mills, and stockpiling by a section of traders.Prices of soybean oil shot up over Tk 200 per litre in the local market at one point.The NBR then extended the timeframe until September 30, which was last Friday.Retailers in Dhaka city markets sold each litre of loose soybean oil at Tk 160 to Tk 175 and the bottled ones at Tk 185 to Tk 192 yesterday, according to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.Soybean oil is selling at the previous rate, confirmed Monwar Hossain, owner of Yasin General Store in Karwan Bazar. The government on August 23 hiked the price of soybean oil for the fourth time this year even though the price of the product in the international market held steady last month.Bangladesh requires about 20 lakh tonnes of edible oil in a year, according to data from the commerce ministry. Only 2.03 lakh tonnes can be sourced from local producers, with the rest met through imports.According to Bangladesh Bank, about 5,15,000 tonnes of crude soybean oil was imported in fiscal year 2021-22, about 75,000 tonnes less than that of the preceding year. On September 20, the commerce ministry sent a letter to the NBR chairman recommending that VAT rate of 5 per cent on import of crude soybean, refined or crude palm oil should be continued and the VAT exemption facility at the production and business level should be extended till June 30, 2023.The letter stated that consumers of Bangladesh are not getting the benefits of falling prices of crude soybean and palm oil in the international market because of high prices of dollar.But the ministry has not got any reply from the NBR, said an official of the commerce ministry."
