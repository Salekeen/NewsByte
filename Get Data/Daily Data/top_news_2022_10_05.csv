She set foot in the world of showbusiness through Lux Channel i Superstar 2009, and has worked in innumerable TV shows ever since.She chats with The Daily Star regarding her decision, and reminisces about her puja holidays.How has these 12 years been for you?I can't believe it has already been a decade that I have been in this industry. I have acted in many TV serials, and received everyone's admiration. From my colleagues in the industry to the viewers, everyone loves me. This is what I appreciate the most.I cherish my identity as an artiste, but I believe it is time for a much-needed break. I am not giving up on acting, I just need a breather.Why did you decide on this so abruptly?I love acting, but I am tired of being offered the same stories, and the same roles. I found myself longing for something different. I don't want to name any names, and I say this with all due respect, but I have been portraying the same characters in the past few months and I am not enjoying this anymore. This is what pushed me to make this decision.I need a break, and some space for myself.You are a two-time elected leader of the Actors' Equity election campaign. How has the organisation been supporting other artistes?

The West accuses Moscow of invading Ukraine while Russia calls it a special military operation.Part of the reason Washington wants lower oil prices is to deprive Moscow of oil revenue while Saudi Arabia has not condemned Moscow's actions.Relations have been strained between the kingdom and the administration of Biden, who travelled to Riyadh this year but failed to secure any firm cooperation commitments on energy.""The decision is technical, not political,"" United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazroui told reporters.""We will not use it as a political organisation,"" he said, adding that concerns about a global recession would be one of the key topics."

But investors have lost their appetite for riskier debt such as leveraged loans, spooked by rapid interest rate hikes around the world, fears of recession and market volatility driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.While Musk will provide much of $44 billion by selling down his stake in electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and by leaning on equity financing from large investors, major banks have committed to provide $12.5 billion.They include Morgan Stanley , Bank of America Corp and Barclays Plc (BARC.L).Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA), Mizuho Financial Group Inc (8411.T) and Societe Generale SA are also part of the syndicate.Noting other recent high-profile losses for banks in leveraged financing, more than 10 bankers and industry analysts told Reuters the outlook was poor for the banks trying to sell the debt.The Twitter debt package is comprised of $6.5 billion in leveraged loans, $3 billion in secured bonds, and another $3 billion in unsecured bonds.""From the banks' perspective, this is less than ideal,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. ""The banks have their backs to the wall - they have no choice but to finance the deal.""Leveraged financing sources have also previously told Reuters that potential losses for Wall Street banks involved in the Twitter debt in such a market could run to hundreds of millions of dollars.Societe Generale did not respond to a request for comment while the other banks declined to comment. Twitter also declined to comment. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Just last week, a group of lenders had to cancel efforts to sell $3.9 billion of debt that financed Apollo Global Management Inc's (APO.N) deal to buy telecom and broadband assets from Lumen Technologies Inc .That came on the heels of a group of banks having to take a $700 million loss on the sale of about $4.55 billion in debt backing the leveraged buyout of business software company Citrix Systems Inc.""The banks are on the hook for Twitter — they took a big loss on the Citrix deal a few weeks ago and they're facing an even bigger headache with this deal,"" said Chris Pultz, portfolio manager for merger arbitrage at Kellner Capital.Banks have been forced to pull back from leveraged financing in the wake of Citrix and other deals weighing on their balance sheet and that is unlikely to change anytime soon.The second quarter also saw U.S. banks start to take a hit on their leveraged loans' exposure as the outlook for dealmaking turned sour.

Another 50,000 are working as freelancers, according to an estimate by industry people.The growing demand for digital designs for e-commerce, catalogues, brochures, magazines, printings, newspapers, signboards, and business cards has created plenty of opportunities for local freelancers and firms.""Worldwide, the e-commerce boom has played a significant role in raising orders for graphic design and image processing,"" said Nazim Farhan Choudhury, chief executive officer of GraphicPeople.India, the Philippines and Vietnam have long been among the major markets for outsourcing for global clients, but Bangladesh has also become a favourite destination owing to lower prices and the ability to deliver large-scale work India, the Philippines and Vietnam have long been among the major markets for outsourcing for global clients, but Bangladesh has also become a favourite destination owing to lower prices and the ability to deliver large-scale work Located in Dhaka, GraphicPeople is an offshore studio providing digital print and production support services to advertising agencies and brands, and counts Dell and Microsoft among its customers. It employs about 250 people.With e-commerce and digital business thriving, the need for pictures and video has gone up. Large studios are flourishing in the global market.The segment even has the potential to diversify the export basket as basic skills are needed to get jobs in graphic design and image processing, said industry people.""What we are doing now is that we are providing backend editing and corrections. But we can be as large as the garment industry,"" Choudhury said.He said the garment sector, which accounts for about 85 per cent of Bangladesh's over $52 billion export earnings in the last fiscal year, has done a remarkable job. But, average salaries and export earnings per worker in the graphic designing and image editing segment are much higher than that of the apparel industry.""The value-edition is about 20 per cent in the garment sector whereas it is close to 100 per cent in the graphic designing and image editing segment.""The outsourcing of graphic designing and image editing is part of the business process outsourcing sector and the broader IT-enabled services industry.Bangladesh earned less than $500 million from the exports of IT-enabled services in the last fiscal year, data from the Export Promotion Bureau showed.However, the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS), the national trade body for software and IT-enabled services, put the figure at $1.3 billion since a significant portion of the overseas income is either brought into the country through unofficial channels or is not fetched at all.The global business process outsourcing market size was valued at $251 billion in 2021 and expected to reach $492 billion by 2028, said California-based newswire distribution network GlobeNewswire, citing data from SkyQuest Technology Consulting Pvt Ltd, an Indian firm.Skill-based training with an emphasis on student loans and certification, recognising companies with more than 500 employees as economic zones, and treating IT-enabled services as emergency services could propel the industry to a higher level and consistently support clients, said Choudhury.Mainly two groups of people work in the segment: individual freelancers working with marketplaces such as Upwork and Fiverr, and the other group that is employed by small and medium-sized firms.Kamruzzaman Sishir, a top-rated character illustrator at Fiverr, a global online marketplace for freelance services, said: ""It's a market with a huge potential.""But earnings depend on skills and there is stiff competition for the designing tasks that need basic skills.""Creativity matters. Some people with a six-month training might not land a job in designing whereas someone can win many orders with the same amount of training thanks to creativity,"" Sishir added.A skilled graphic designer and image editor can command six-figure salaries easily whereas someone with a lower level of skills struggles to earn Tk 15,000, according to the freelancer.The KOW Company, a content post-production management company with a focus on image and image editing, began its journey in 2014 with a three-member team and a one-room office in Dhaka's Bangla Motor. Today, it has grown into a family of more than 500 individuals working with 25 studios globally and processing around 25,000 photos every day.Kowser Ahmed Nirob, CEO and founder of The KOW Company, thinks image editing, computer-generated imagery, 3D, and content post-production segments have a big potential to fetch foreign currencies.From Bangladesh, many people go to the Middle East spending Tk 5 lakh to Tk 6 lakh. Many of them have to sell land to manage the fund. But the return is very low.""If they get proper training, they can earn foreign currencies sitting at home within a few months. Besides, graphic design and related verticals require basic skills to land jobs,"" said Nirob.According to the entrepreneur, it takes more than two years to become a skilled software developer.""But for image processing, if you train someone for six months, you will get a skilled worker to get your job done.""Wahid Sharif, president of the Bangladesh Association of Contact Center and Outsourcing, said as e-commerce and digital needs are thriving globally, the demand for image processing and related segments is growing fast.""It is one of the most promising areas in the business process outsourcing.""Russell T Ahmed, president of the BASIS, said creativity and basic skills are needed to flourish in the world of graphic designing and image editing.""For a graphic design or image editing job, you don't need a graduate in computer science and engineering. A graduate in the humanities and other areas can do it with training,"" he said.Ahmed underscores branding for the industry as well.""We are lagging when it comes to branding. If we can brand well, our firms will get smooth access to the global market,"" he said."
/opinion/views/news/exploiting-newtons-law-gravity-store-green-energy-3134951,Exploiting Newton’s law of gravity to store green energy,"Many power plants these days harness energies from solar radiation, wind, ocean waves, and other green sources. However, like many other innovations, these sources have downsides. We can generate abundant green power only when the sun shines or the wind blows or the waves roll.What do we do when the skies become dark and winds and oceans are calm? How do we satisfy the requirements of our energy-ravenous society?The solution to this predicament is based on the immutable Newtonian logic: ""What goes up, must come down."" It is the gravity battery that replicates the fabled story of Isaac Newton's falling apple, but reconfigured on a much larger scale – with a little twist.When a colossal mass, such as a concrete block, is lifted to a greater height using surplus green energy, it is stored in the block as gravitational energy. Also known as potential energy, it is the energy stored in an object because of its elevated position relative to the ground. The greater the height is, the greater potential energy is. When the block is lowered, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which sets the turbine of a generator into motion, producing electricity.Energy generated from gravity batteries is sustainable. Furthermore, they will store green energy when there is too much and release it into the grid when there is too little. Besides, the tremendous weight of the block coupled with its slow descent will create a huge amount of rotational force – or torque – in the generator, allowing it to deliver maximum power almost instantaneously.Gravity batteries have some distinct advantages over other batteries, such as lithium-ion or nickel-cadmium batteries that lose their capacity to store energy in a few years. Consequently, they have a short lifetime, and recycling these batteries is difficult. Moreover, whereas mining the minerals – cobalt, lithium, manganese, nickel, cadmium and other rare earth elements – required for these batteries poses environmental problems and health-related risks for the miners, a block of iron needed for a gravity battery has a much lighter environmental footprint.Because gravity batteries are mechanical devices, they can break. For example, a cable can snap, or a winch can jam, or a patch of rust can appear in a metallic part. Though problematic, these issues are not beyond repair, because individual components can be fixed or replaced with relative ease instead of replacing the entire system. So there is real scope for a gravity battery to have an operational life spanning a few decades.Gravitricity Ltd, a UK-based green engineering company founded in 2011, is working to make gravity batteries a reality. The company successfully tested its first prototype: an iron block weighing 50 tonnes, hoisted 15 metres up before gradually releasing it back, powering a series of electric generators with the downward gravitational force.When fully operational, Gravitricity expects each battery to release between one megawatt (MW) and 20MW at peak power for up to eight hours. According to their website, a 20MW power system ""could power 63,000 homes for every hour that it discharges.""Gravity batteries can also be deployed underground, leaving a significantly smaller surface footprint. They can be installed in abandoned mine shafts deep enough to house a full-sized battery. Electricity can be generated by raising the weights in the shaft, and then lowering them to activate a generator. Some researchers even came up with an unconventional yet ingenious idea of turning skyscrapers essentially into huge gravity batteries.Gravitricity is exploring the possibility of having a battery consisting of 24 weights, each weighing 500 tonnes, for a total of 12,000 tonnes located down a shaft at a depth of at least 300 metres. Once operational, the battery with a 50-year design life is anticipated to generate 20MW of power with a maximum efficiency of 80 percent.The idea of restoring abandoned sites of fossil fuel as repositories for green energy is not only eminently practical, it also embodies the values of ""just transition,"" which preaches principles and practices for transforming extractive economy into a regenerative one.Established in 2017 in southern Switzerland, Energy Vault is another leader in developing gravity batteries. When green power supply exceeds demand, the excess energy is used to lift a pair of 30-tonne blocks upwards to the top of a steel and concrete structure standing more than 20-storeys tall. When demand exceeds supply, they are dropped down, generating enough electricity for thousands of homes.Gravity batteries can also work on a small scale for use in places such as a remote village or a shed. It works on a simple principle. Attach to the light bulb hanging from a wall or ceiling a bag filled with rocks, sand, or any heavy object, and then winch it up to the top. As the bag gradually drops to the ground, it will drive a generator through a gearbox converting the motion to electricity that will light up the bulb for about 20 minutes, without using any fossil fuel.Another gravity-based energy storage technique is called Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH). It uses the force of gravity to produce electricity by funnelling water uphill using surplus solar, wind or other green power, and then, when needed, forces it down to drive the electricity-generating turbine in a power station. Unlike conventional hydropower plants, PSH recycles the water. First used in the US in 1930, PSHs have a long life with minimal maintenance requirement and little ecological repercussions. PSH facilities can be found in many countries now.The world needs bold and innovative climate solutions right now, particularly for storing green energy for later use. On this front, there may not be any silver bullets. But gravity batteries – with their harnessing of a truly infinite, omnipresent gravitational force – certainly have a role to play. The big question is: how soon will gravity batteries come to fruition? Dr Quamrul Haider is a professor of physics at Fordham University in New York, US.

/health/healthcare/news/cultural-therapy-mental-health-patients-3135581,“Cultural therapy” for mental health patients!,"Research is needed to determine the best approach to treating patients with mental illnesses. A group of Dhaka University students of theater and performance studies department started research at Pabna Mental Hospital -- on how patients suffering from mental illness can be treated using ""cultural therapy"".In the past two days, a group of five departmental students -- Fazle Navid Onon, Tanvir Newaz Tirtho, Jannatul Mawa Nibir, Farzana Afrin Meem, and Shithi Ishra Risil -- conducted field research among patients and medical staff of the hospital, reports our Pabna correspondent.""Many of the mentally ill people we spoke with have an extraordinary ability to expose themselves. In addition to traditional medicine, they also need cultural therapy to help them enjoy life. Cultural therapy can help a mental patient in this way,"" said Fazle Navid Onon, a member of the research team.He explained that theoretically, cultural therapy is divided into three categories: ""art therapy,"" ""drama therapy,"" and ""music therapy.""""Different patients have various preferences. Some patients enjoy drama and painting, while others enjoy music. Before working with a patient, we must first determine what is appropriate for that patient,"" said another team member Jannatul Mawa.""The majority of the patients we spoke with and tried to implement these three methods with during our visit to the mental hospitals in Pabna had positive responses, so we are optimistic that the cultural therapy will be successful for mental patients,"" she added.""We have already gathered patient histories and followed their medical care before deciding to start therapy,"" said Tanvir Newaz, adding that the initiative will be more successful if it takes on an organisational structure.Students launched the research work under the supervision of departmental teacher Professor Dr Ishrafil Shahin to implement ""cultural therapy"" for giving treatment among the mental patients.However, Dr Safkat Wahid, director of Pabna Mental Hospital, told The Daily Star that if ""cultural therapy"" can be properly implemented, it will be a key development in the treatment of mental patients, but it should be implemented at the domestic level."

/business/economy/opinion/news/creating-virtuous-circles-between-urban-planning-and-urban-transit-3135616,Creating virtuous circles between urban planning and urban transit,"Cities are not just places where people live. They are massive labour markets and engines of economic growth, facilitating structural transformation of economies towards manufacturing and service activities. New urban transport infrastructure changes how people access jobs and matches employees to firms.The relationship between urban development and transport systems is both critical and complex. Without effective urban transit, commuting becomes too costly, and cities cannot deliver on their full economic potential.Many cities in developed countries have a high enough density of demand to support urban transit infrastructure. This is not always the case in developing countries, especially in Africa, where urban structure is fragmented, and firms and households are dispersed. Fragmented urban development disconnects workers from jobs preventing the emergence of sustainable mobility options.In Nairobi, Kenya, 42 per cent of the population walk to work. They can only access 11 per cent of jobs and even the further 28 per cent who take minibuses are only able to access 20 per cent of jobs.  As a result of this fragmented urban form, Nairobi does not have an integrated labour market. Instead, it functions like a city with multiple small villages.The fragmented urban form and the preponderance of informal sector jobs in Cape Town, South Africa have made mass transit ineffective when it comes to connecting to labour markets. The Central Business District has become the transfer point for peripheral dwellers to connect to job opportunities on another spoke in the public transport network. The hub-and-spoke public transport network provides inconvenient connections, especially to the poor workers commuting from the periphery.As such, an increasing number of poor people in South Africa are opting out of the public transport system as they decide to take up jobs closer to their homes. Ironically, government funding flows primarily to large scale transport options, such as railways that carry only 16 per cent of passengers, even as two thirds of commuting trips are made on unregulated minibuses.Where urban density is higher, scale dependent transport solutions, such as the Bus Rapid Transit, (BRT) can emerge. There are now more than 180 of such systems operating globally, yet little is known about their economic impacts in emerging cities.Lagos, Nigeria is among the few urban areas in Africa with high density of demand, and one of the first cities in the region to invest in modern mass transit infrastructure.Lagos has a population of twenty-four million people and an additional one million people are reported to move to the city in search of jobs annually. In an effort to decongest the city and increase productivity, the government has developed an integrated multi-model transport plan that calls for the construction of six railway lines, 14 BRT systems, along with a comprehensive reform of bus and water transport systems.Currently, people spend four hours in congestion daily, on average, which is detrimental to productivity.To increase connectivity of isolated communities to the main transport interchange locations, last mile buses have been introduced to connect people to the BRT system. In other areas, non-motorised transport systems, such as bicycle racks where people can rent bicycles to assist with mobility, have been introduced.However, there has been no research conducted to quantify the benefits arising from transit investment in Lagos. This makes it difficult to know what complementary investments and policies need to be introduced to unlock the full economic potential of the city.BRT'S EFFECT ON COMMUTER CHOICES AND JOB ACCESSIBILITYRecent research on Bogota, Colombia's BRT system reveals the immediate effect on commuter choices and job accessibility, as well as the equilibrium effects on wages and house prices.Thanks to shorter commuting times, BRT systems can significantly increase the number of jobs accessible to residents. This is especially true for the urban poor, who are 25 per cent more likely to commute to work by bus. In addition, the development of new BRT systems increases residential floorspace prices and residential population and yields overall economic welfare gains of one to two percent.WOMEN AND URBAN TRANSITPublic transport invigorates local labour market, and their design affects the participation of disadvantaged groups. In particular, poor transit systems have been identified as a major factor in job location choices of women.Countries like India, Brazil and Mexico have introduced a variety of measures to improve women's safety on mass transit. Several studies show that women are willing to pay more for transport services that offer a sense of increased safety and greater social acceptability:A study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, finds that a fifth of women riders are willing to pay 20 per cent more of the fare to ride in the ""safe space"" of women-only subway cars, where the risk of physical harassment is reported to be 50 per cent lower.In Cairo, Egypt, research shows that women are more willing to pay for ride-hailing and ride-sharing due to improved safety relative to other options. Lowering the price of these services further increases female mobility.In Lahore, Pakistan, a study reveals that offering women-only transport services reduced physical mobility constraints and resulted in increased job searches for women. Those who received a 50 per cent transport subsidy were four times more likely to apply for jobs than those that did not.SUPPORTING URBAN TRANSPORT PLANNERS WITH NEW QUANTITATIVE ECONOMIC MODELSQuantifying transit and land use policies is important for helping policy-makers understand what complementary policies should be developed to maximise the return on infrastructure investments.New Urban Models, such as those developed by Gabriel M Ahfeldt, a professor of urban economics and land development at the London School of Economics, can help city leaders visualise how economic productivity and urban form mutually interact as they provide a better description of the city and give a much richer set of responses to infrastructure investment and policy changes.For instance, a tradable and dense city may have different options from a crowded and fragmented city. The model developed by Ahfedt of an internal city structure features agglomeration and dispersion forces, and an arbitrary number of heterogeneous city blocks, which makes it tractable and amenable to empirical analysis.Research on transit infrastructure has mainly been conducted in wealthy economies. There is limited evidence in developing countries, which are vastly different.For instance, there might be low population density and fragmented distribution, high levels of congestion, and a different set of modal choices, given that a sizable-large informal sector provides the vast majority of commuting trips for many.There is a need to develop innovative transport solutions that can be efficient and cost-effective in the low-density cities of developing economies. Economic models can play an essential role in informing this process. Nick Tsivanides is an assistant professor of the Department of Economics at the University of California at Berkeley; Somik Lall is a lead economist of the World Bank; and Mumba Ngulube is the infrastructure economist at the World Bank."

/life-living/travel/news/top-6-places-travel-sunamganj-3135696,Top 6 places to travel in Sunamganj,"A scenic place full of beautiful haors, serene rivers, and culturally diverse monuments, Sunamganj, situated in the Sylhet division of north-eastern Bangladesh, is a place that travel enthusiasts will fall in love with. Whether you want to go for a single day tour or take your time to visit the beautiful places spread around the district, we recommend these 6 places to be part of your next travel itinerary.  The place that is in everyone's travelling wish list, Tanguar Haor is a unique wetland ecosystem located in the Dharmapash and Tahirpur upazilas. Witness the haor turn into a large waterbody with strong waves in monsoon or greet over 200 kinds of migratory birds in winter; the wetland is a soothing sight for the tired urban eyes. To fully experience the magic of haors, reserve a boat and just roam around on the waters, see fishermen catch over 140 species of fresh water fishes and witness the diverse natural and aquatic elements.Also known as The Keane Bridge, built in 1936, Surma Bridge is one of the most iconic steel and iron architectures of Bangladesh. Standing on the Surma River, this bridge is 18 feet wide and 1150 feet long. Roaming around the bridge as the day ends, while the river under is glowing in the moonlight is a visual treat for all travellers. Even with new bridges around, the Surma Bridge still gives a nostalgic feeling of the bygone era.Originating in Meghalaya and flowing into Sunamganj, this river is close to Tanguar haor. If you want to see really blue waters where even the river bed can be seen in shallow areas, then this is the river for you. In monsoon this river gets wider while in winter the white sandy banks give it a wonderful picturesque scenic element.On the bank of Jadukata River, a small hillock of about 150 feet high is located named Barik Tila. The dividing point of the Bangladesh border with India, one needs to go to the hillock to get a wider and clearer view of both sides. From this side of the border, stunning panoramic views of mountains and forests of Meghalaya can be seen, giving this hillock a unique edge.   Hason Raja, a Bangladeshi mystic poet and songwriter, whose old house situated at the bank of Surma River in the Tegharia area, has been converted into a museum. This house holds a special place among followers of Raja as all his songs were composed in this place. Inside the museum, there is a photograph of Hason Raja, along with paintings by different artists, but the real attractions are the various items related to the memory of the poet including tables, chairs, colourful cloaks, sword, earthenware, etc.Also known as Raypur Boro Mosque, which is located in the village of Raypur, Paschim Pagla union in south Sunamganj and built in 1941. It's a two storey building with three large domes and six towering minarets and famous for its exquisite craftsmanship. Built entirely on bricks, without using any rods, other unique aspects of this mosque are its amazing crafted designs on the floor with rare white stones surrounded by blocks of black stones. The mihrab features elegant designs that are created by cutting gorgeous stones."
/opinion/views/news/open-letter-bangladeshi-youth-3135266,An open letter to Bangladeshi youth,"In a few short days, I will leave Bangladesh again. The first time I left, I left because I wanted to know more about the world and my place in it. A decade, a Master's degree, and a humanitarian mission later, I know there is still a lot more left to learn.You might be wondering who I am to write you a letter. In a number of ways, I am no one special. I have not done much that is worthy of note, and have not won any awards you might know of. But I did grow up here and I know how the rain feels. I know the air and I know the dog that sits in the corner of my street. And so, perhaps foolishly, I feel like I can write to you. But I do have an ulterior motive, like all who write must.For the past 18 months, I have worked for an international agency engaged in the Rohingya refugee response. I have been fortunate enough to learn from a community forced out of their homes, and in their plight, I have seen time and time again the urgency of fighting for our collective future. My note to you is a request to think of those deprived of what you and I can take for granted.Right now, 4,000 Rohingyas are stuck in the ""no man's land"" between Bangladesh and Myanmar. While a small percentage compared to the one million who have found safety in Cox's Bazar, these 4,000 humans are victims of the same armed aggression, state brutality and global inaction that has defined generations of the Rohingya experience. Across an increasingly fractured world, conflict remains the primary driver of human displacement, and a reminder that things can break apart anytime, anywhere.To make matters worse, when humans are forced to flee, they are met with barbed wires and the blunt ends of rifles. The richest states are the worst offenders, with pushbacks and incarceration common across Europe and North America. Those who are lucky to find safety still face an uncertain future. Services, resources and compassion available to refugees vary greatly and, despite grand claims of equality, can often be traced over the colour of one's skin.Climate change is causing this already flawed system to short-circuit. In northern Bangladesh, the floodwaters showed no signs of receding for a month; in southern Iraq, rivers as old as civilisation itself are drying up. This change, this radical shift, acts as both cause and correlation, precipitating and amplifying the need for people to move. We cannot stop this; we can only prepare for it.What does this mean for Bangladesh, where one out of every seven people is projected to be displaced over the next few decades? One out of seven people can be someone we know, someone we love, someone we are willing to take on the world for.I am plagued by a question that has no easy answer: as the waters rise, as cities become richer and towns become poorer, how do we ensure that humans are able to move to provide for themselves and their families? How do we do so sustainably, yet humanely, in a crowded and under-resourced country? How do we urge the privileged to share responsibility for the forgotten?We are nowhere near where we need to be. Everything that will decide the future is up in the air: in Geneva, they are debating whether climate migrants are refugees; in Sylhet, they already are. These definitions matter because they are tied to responsibility and resources. Equally importantly, it matters who is part of these discussions – where they come from and what languages they speak.Everyone agrees that responsibilities need to be shared, but no one agrees on how. Those who start wars, and those who contribute disproportionately to climate change, should theoretically shoulder more, but that is often not the case. We are trying to hold these feet to the fire, but to paraphrase a colleague, we need more hands.Bangladesh, despite the great inequality that plagues it, is aware of the existential threat that faces everything we hold dear. But Bangladesh – and dare I say the world – needs you. You hold, in your anger and your compassion, the ability to bend the arc of our future towards justice. Your voices, in their unfiltered clarity and unbridled possibility, can inform and influence those with power over lives. Regardless of what others may tell you, you are in a position to inform. Everyone can read theory – only a few live it.And so, when you think your words are not strong enough, make them stronger. When your critique doesn't raise enough brows, be more critical. Tell us, no holds barred, about everything we are doing wrong – about systemic change, about local leadership, about innovation and opportunity.You don't have to be a humanitarian to do this work. On the contrary, those who do this for a living need reminders from those who want to live. Movements live and die with those who support them with their time and energy, with their rage and joy, with their art, their words, their stories about what is at stake: the rain, the air, the dog in the corner of the street we grew up in.Imrul Islam is the outgoing advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Bangladesh.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/unseen-pressure-beauty-circus-mahmud-didar-3135731,An unseen pressure is on ‘Beauty Circus’: Mahmud Didar,"When ""Beauty Circus"" first emerged with its teaser/trailer, it is safe to say that many received the wrong idea about the film. In reality, it is a wonderful amalgamation of the lost art of circus, and the times of our Liberation War.Mahmud Didar's debut directorial film was released in September 23, in 19 halls across the country. It features Jaya Ahsan, Ferdous, ABM Sumon, Gazi Rakayet and the late Humayun Sadhu, among others.The film went head-to-head with Dipankar Dipon's ""Operation Sundarban"", another heavyweight production by the RAB Welfare and Cooperative Society Limited. The latter, however, was released on the same day in 35 halls across the country. On the second week, halls for ""Operation Sundarban"" increased to 45, while halls for ""Beauty Circus"" was reduced to a measly 11 halls.The director of ""Beauty Circus"", Mahmud Didar, has been vocal about the fact that some 'unknown forces' have been tampering with the film's 'true' success. According to Didar, this is the reason why it did not get the number of halls, that the production crew had been hoping for. For this film Didar had received a government grant in the 2014-15 fiscal year. It has been co-produced by Channel i.""Our film so far has received a positive response, despite not being able to market properly before release,"" says Didar.On the first week of release, Jaya Ahsan expressed her disappointment with Star Cineplex authorities, for not giving them slots for evening show. Initially, Cineplex ran two shows of ""Beauty Circus"", at 11 am, and 4:50 pm. The actress expressed concerns that the audience prefers evening shows, in comparison. On its second week, ""Beauty Circus"" did finally get evening shows.The distribution of ""Beauty Circus"" had been sold to director Anonno Mamun. ""He was given the responsibility of managing the number of halls. However, after a few days of the film's release, he went to Kolkata and we couldn't reach him,"" shares the director. ""I won't directly blame anyone, but there has been an unseen pressure on every one, but from our end we did not put enough effort as well.""The director shares that after the announcement of its release date, they had been wanting postpone the date. Eventually, that did not happen, since the production house informed Didar that there is no empty slot in the coming months.""Our posters were not visible in the halls, I feel like we have been neglected,"" shares the dejected director. ""Honestly, even the halls that we showcased the film in, outside of Dhaka – most of them were not up to the mark.""""I am doing everything that is possible,"" says Didar. ""In a huge premise like Jamuna Blockbuster Cinemas, we had only one poster! Despite that, my audience is my strength, which is why we got houseful shows there.""""Due to a huge communication gap between the artistes and the producers, the entire production was hampered"", says the director.On the third week of its release, ""Beauty Circus"" is making its way to international waters. It will be released in Australia,on October 9, across a few theatres in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, and Canberra. ""It is definitely a great news for all of us, and I am hopeful that the international audience will receive the film well.""According to Didar, circus is an extinct culture in our country, it has been evicted by a group of fundamentalists. His film not only tells the tale of an indomitable woman and her struggle, but it also showcases the strength she has to fight against evil. ""Punching upwards is a theme that I explore, through the narrative of Beauty Circus."""
