Another 50,000 are working as freelancers, according to an estimate by industry people.The growing demand for digital designs for e-commerce, catalogues, brochures, magazines, printings, newspapers, signboards, and business cards has created plenty of opportunities for local freelancers and firms.""Worldwide, the e-commerce boom has played a significant role in raising orders for graphic design and image processing,"" said Nazim Farhan Choudhury, chief executive officer of GraphicPeople.India, the Philippines and Vietnam have long been among the major markets for outsourcing for global clients, but Bangladesh has also become a favourite destination owing to lower prices and the ability to deliver large-scale work India, the Philippines and Vietnam have long been among the major markets for outsourcing for global clients, but Bangladesh has also become a favourite destination owing to lower prices and the ability to deliver large-scale work Located in Dhaka, GraphicPeople is an offshore studio providing digital print and production support services to advertising agencies and brands, and counts Dell and Microsoft among its customers. It employs about 250 people.With e-commerce and digital business thriving, the need for pictures and video has gone up. Large studios are flourishing in the global market.The segment even has the potential to diversify the export basket as basic skills are needed to get jobs in graphic design and image processing, said industry people.""What we are doing now is that we are providing backend editing and corrections. But we can be as large as the garment industry,"" Choudhury said.He said the garment sector, which accounts for about 85 per cent of Bangladesh's over $52 billion export earnings in the last fiscal year, has done a remarkable job. But, average salaries and export earnings per worker in the graphic designing and image editing segment are much higher than that of the apparel industry.""The value-edition is about 20 per cent in the garment sector whereas it is close to 100 per cent in the graphic designing and image editing segment.""The outsourcing of graphic designing and image editing is part of the business process outsourcing sector and the broader IT-enabled services industry.Bangladesh earned less than $500 million from the exports of IT-enabled services in the last fiscal year, data from the Export Promotion Bureau showed.However, the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS), the national trade body for software and IT-enabled services, put the figure at $1.3 billion since a significant portion of the overseas income is either brought into the country through unofficial channels or is not fetched at all.The global business process outsourcing market size was valued at $251 billion in 2021 and expected to reach $492 billion by 2028, said California-based newswire distribution network GlobeNewswire, citing data from SkyQuest Technology Consulting Pvt Ltd, an Indian firm.Skill-based training with an emphasis on student loans and certification, recognising companies with more than 500 employees as economic zones, and treating IT-enabled services as emergency services could propel the industry to a higher level and consistently support clients, said Choudhury.Mainly two groups of people work in the segment: individual freelancers working with marketplaces such as Upwork and Fiverr, and the other group that is employed by small and medium-sized firms.Kamruzzaman Sishir, a top-rated character illustrator at Fiverr, a global online marketplace for freelance services, said: ""It's a market with a huge potential.""But earnings depend on skills and there is stiff competition for the designing tasks that need basic skills.""Creativity matters. Some people with a six-month training might not land a job in designing whereas someone can win many orders with the same amount of training thanks to creativity,"" Sishir added.A skilled graphic designer and image editor can command six-figure salaries easily whereas someone with a lower level of skills struggles to earn Tk 15,000, according to the freelancer.The KOW Company, a content post-production management company with a focus on image and image editing, began its journey in 2014 with a three-member team and a one-room office in Dhaka's Bangla Motor. Today, it has grown into a family of more than 500 individuals working with 25 studios globally and processing around 25,000 photos every day.Kowser Ahmed Nirob, CEO and founder of The KOW Company, thinks image editing, computer-generated imagery, 3D, and content post-production segments have a big potential to fetch foreign currencies.From Bangladesh, many people go to the Middle East spending Tk 5 lakh to Tk 6 lakh. Many of them have to sell land to manage the fund. But the return is very low.""If they get proper training, they can earn foreign currencies sitting at home within a few months. Besides, graphic design and related verticals require basic skills to land jobs,"" said Nirob.According to the entrepreneur, it takes more than two years to become a skilled software developer.""But for image processing, if you train someone for six months, you will get a skilled worker to get your job done.""Wahid Sharif, president of the Bangladesh Association of Contact Center and Outsourcing, said as e-commerce and digital needs are thriving globally, the demand for image processing and related segments is growing fast.""It is one of the most promising areas in the business process outsourcing.""Russell T Ahmed, president of the BASIS, said creativity and basic skills are needed to flourish in the world of graphic designing and image editing.""For a graphic design or image editing job, you don't need a graduate in computer science and engineering. A graduate in the humanities and other areas can do it with training,"" he said.Ahmed underscores branding for the industry as well.""We are lagging when it comes to branding. If we can brand well, our firms will get smooth access to the global market,"" he said."

/news/world/news/south-korean-missile-fails-after-successful-north-korean-rocket-test-3135506,South Korean missile fails after successful North Korean rocket test,"A malfunctioning South Korean ballistic missile blew up as it plowed into the ground Wednesday during a live-fire drill with the United States that was a reprisal for North Korea's successful launch a day earlier of a weapon that flew over Japan and has the range to strike the US territory of Guam.The explosion and subsequent fire panicked and confused residents of the coastal city of Gangneung, who were already uneasy over the increasingly provocative weapons tests by rival North Korea. Their concern that it could be a North Korean attack only grew as the military and government officials provided no explanation about the explosion for hours.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said no injuries have been reported from the explosion, which involved a short-range Hyumoo-2 missile that crashed inside an air force base in the outskirts of the city. It said the crash didn't affect any civilian facilities.During the same drill, the US military launched four of its own missiles that are part of the Army Tactical Missile System and South Korea fired another Hyumoo-2 successfully. The homegrown missile is key to South Korea's preemptive and retaliatory strike strategies against the North and is a version of a Russian-designed Iskander missile, which is also possessed by the North.Kwon Seong-dong, a ruling party lawmaker representing Gangneung, wrote on Facebook that a ""weapons system operated by our blood-like taxpayer money ended up threatening our own people"" and called for the military to thoroughly investigate the missile failure. He also criticized the military for not issuing a notice about the failure while maintaining a media embargo on the joint drills.""It was an irresponsible response,"" Kwon wrote. ""They don't even have an official press release yet.""South Korea's military acknowledged the missile malfunction hours after internet users raised alarm about the blast and posted social media videos showing an orange ball of flames emerging from an area they described as near the air force base. It said it was investigating what caused the ""abnormal flight"" of the missile.Officials at Gangneung's fire department and city hall said emergency workers were dispatched to the air force base and a nearby army base in response to calls about a possible explosion but were sent back by military officials.The US and South Korean militaries are conducting the joint exercises to show their ability to deter a North Korean attack on the South. In addition to missile launches, they involved bombing runs by F-15 strike jets using precision munitions.North Korea's successful launch of a nuclear-capable ballistic missile hours before the drills was the country's most provocative weapons demonstration since 2017 and was its fifth round of weapons tests in 10 days.That missile has a range capable of striking Guam, which is home to one of the largest military facilities maintained by the US in Asia. North Korea in 2017 also tested missiles capable of hitting the continental United States.North Korea has fired nearly 40 ballistic missiles over about 20 different launch events this year, exploiting Russia's war on Ukraine and the resulting deep divide in the UN Security Council to accelerate its arms development without risking further sanctions.Its aim is to develop a fully fledged nuclear arsenal capable of threatening the US mainland and its allies while gaining recognition as a nuclear state and wresting concessions from those countries.The United States, Britain, France, Albania, Norway and Ireland called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the latest North Korean launch. Diplomats said it is likely to be held Wednesday, but it's not certain whether it will be open or closed."
/business/economy/news/4ir-e-sports-and-bangladesh-3135166,"4IR, e-sports and Bangladesh","Rapidly adapting to changes driven by industrial revolutions is what allows a nation to earn its rightful place in the world. The Third Industrial Revolution marked the beginning of the digital age and globalisation, inadvertently creating what we now call 'pop culture', allowing technologies to become the definitive vehicle of entertainment around the world. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) started around the turn of the new millennium, but its influence can already be felt in every aspect of modern life. With smartphones and wireless internet connectivity having achieved ubiquity, social media has become an integral part of our lives, supported by artificial intelligence and deep-learning algorithms.It has enabled our entertainment options to take new forms, turning streaming video, e-books, and of course, modern video games into new global standards.With breathtaking graphics and stunning audio, these games can be enjoyed even on smartphones, and many of them are focused on competitive online multiplayer, allowing scores of players to compete against each other over internet.Dedicated tournaments of such games, affectionately called e-sports, have already taken the world by storm.While traditional forms of physical sports remain profitable and popular, they are rather restrictive, given their deeply segregated tiers and divisions. But the vastly cerebral and online nature of e-sports ensures that they are unfettered by international borders, and even a wheelchair-bound teenage girl from Bangladesh can go toe to toe with a European professional e-sports player from halfway around the world and actually win, should she have the skills to do so, without even having to be in the same continent, let alone in the same physical arena.E-sports offer greater foundations of equality, tolerance and acceptance, where issues such as age, gender, ethnicity and/or many kinds of physical handicaps are irrelevant, and players are gauged solely on the basis of their talents and abilities. Anyone with the skills, the reflexes and the will can become a formidable force.Purely intellect-driven sports such as chess have always enjoyed a dedicated following, but e-sports can enjoy far more widespread viewership because of their breakneck pacing, vibrant visuals and innately flashy nature, making them far more suitable as universally appealing spectator events.Even in purely monetary terms, e-sports are impacting the industry in seismic ways. The planning, creation and governance of new intellectual properties alone are worth billions of dollars, not to mention the production of tie-in properties based on the rich lore of these games. These enable countless new job opportunities to exist at every level of this industry, where Bangladesh, with its abundance of talent, can become a powerful player.It is, therefore, of critical importance that the government of Bangladesh takes the necessary steps to scout out, nurture and train talents from our country for this very purpose.In the context of the ongoing 4IR, denying the impacts of technologies in our lives  especially in the fields of entertainment and wholesome competition  can only drive us further away from it. E-sports can build bridges where traditional sports can't, and Bangladesh must embrace it. Unless we accept the future, the future will not accept us.The author is the founder of the Bangladesh Esports Association "

There were hundreds of patients in the ward.Ward doctor Farhana Noorin told The Daily Star that the nebuliser was closed due to lack of electricity. The AC was not running, and neither were ceiling fans.Electricity supply in the area resumed only around 7:40pm.There was no electricity supply at wards of the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation in Dhaka, Prof Abdul Gani Mollah, director of NITOR, told The Daily Star.However, services at OT, ICU, CCU, and HDU went on normally due to generator backup, he said, adding that the emergency department also ran as usual.Our correspondent found nurses administering injections to patientsusing mobile flashlights at the wards of Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute.There was no power supply at wards and the general surgery remained shut at the Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, confirmed Khalilur Rahman, the director of the hospital.The hospital authorities kept the emergency department and operation theatre open with the help of a generator.Elsewhere, normal life was disrupted as city dwellers used mobile flashlights to walk on roads while roadside shops and kitchen markets were illuminated by candles.Many people were found frantically looking for alternative ways to illuminate their homes.After the national grid line failure, people rushed to nearby refilling stations to purchase fuel to power their generators.Our correspondents found long queues in at least two petrol pumps with people clamouring for either diesel or petrol to keep their generators operational.Ashik, a caretaker of an apartment building in Dhanmondi, rushed to Sadek Khan Petrol Pump. ""After waiting four hours I could buy only 55 litres of diesel,"" he said, adding that he needed 55 more litres.Power outages also disrupted telecommunication and internet services in the country. Mobile phone users around the country claimed to face difficulties in making calls and using the internet.Due to the sweltering heat, staying at home was not easy for people.Speaking to The Daily Star, Mominul Haque, an employee of a private bank, said he did not buy candles in the hope that his IPS would provide backup power.""But it [IPS] did not last long  Now we're sitting in complete darkness amid this hot weather,"" he said.ATMs of different banks in many areas were found shut as their backup power died.Abdur Rahim, employee of a private organisation, tried to withdraw cash from ATM booths in Savar. ""Security guards told me they shut booths as backup power ran out,"" he said. "

Many others had to suspend their operations early.Shopping malls in the capital also suffered losses due to the blackout. Private offices were affected because of disruptions in telecommunication and internet connections, while ATM booths of many commercial banks also went out of service.Some banks had to wait till night to settle transactions through electronic networks.People queued up in front of filling stations had to wait for hours to collect diesel for generators to keep offices and other establishments running. Many returned without diesel after waiting for several hours.""We could not run [our] factories even though we have standby generators. Filling stations were not able to meet the demand of the buyers,"" said Shahidullah Azim, vice-president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.He said the garment sector normally produces items worth $150 million every day. But yesterday's power failure caused production losses worth $50 million.Saiful Islam, president of the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said no electricity means no production and stopping of the industrial units.The cost of doing business has been on the rise in recent months because of load shedding, he said.Shamsul Haque, director of KSRM Group, a leading steel maker, said that production of steel requires uninterrupted power supply. He said they had to stop production yesterday for some time due to the power outage since noon.""We continue our production with backup electricity for about two to three hours. If there is any blackout for a longer period, our production gets affected.""Syed M Tanvir, a director of Pacific Jeans Ltd and director of Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that there was no impact of the blackout on the Chattogram Export Processing Zone as it gets electricity from a specific power producer.However, productions in the garment and other industrial factories located outside the CEPZ were disrupted. Many continued their production by cutting the duration of shifts.Md Fazlul Hoque, managing director of Plummy Fashions Ltd, a leading knitwear manufacturer and exporter based in Nararyanganj, said power went off around 1:10pm.""We had to let our second-shift workers go home around 6:30pm amid uncertainty over when the power connectivity would be restored. We kept our factory running with standby generators.""Helal Uddin, president of Bangladesh Dokan Malik Samity, said traders in different parts of the country had to shut their stores before the sun went down.Rizwan Rahman, president of Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the government has to find out why the national grid failed."

De Kock made his second successive fifty with a hit over the fence off Umesh Yadav.The pair hit eight sixes between them before the partnership ended with De Kock's run out in his attempt to steal a second run.- India's bowling woes -
Rossouw, who hit eight sixes, then got going with Tristan Stubbs in another big partnership of 87 and surpassed his previous best of 96 not out to reach his hundred in 48 balls.Stubbs, who was warned by pace bowler Deepak Chahar for backing up too far at the non-striker's end when on 13, made 23.Rossouw finished unbeaten and David Miller, who hit a 100 in the second T20, smacked three straight sixes in the final over from Chahar to score an unbeaten 19 off five balls.India captain Rohit Sharma said bowling remains one of the things to be worked upon before heading into the World Cup Down under.""Areas of concerns, we have to look at our bowling, what more options we can find in the powerplay, middle and death,"" said Rohit whose side also beat Australia 2-1 in a three-match T20 series last month.""We were playing two quality sides, (we) have to go back and see what we can do better. It will be challenging and we need to find answers, still working towards that.""India's chase started badly as they lost two early wickets including Rohit for a duck after the opener got an inside edge on to his stumps from pace bowler Kagiso Rabada.Wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant (27) and Dinesh Karthik (46) attempted to revive the chase in an attacking partnership of 41 off 20 balls.Pant got out after hitting three fours and two sixes in his 14-ball knock, but Karthik kept up the charge.Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj denied Karthik his fifty after the batsman attempted a reverse scoop only to be bowled.The rest of the batting, which missed Virat Kohli and KL Rahul who were rested, failed to challenge the bowlers apart from Chahar who made a valiant 31 of 17 balls.Fast bowler Dwaine Pretorius, who came in for the rested Anrich Nortje, stood out with figures of 3-26 in his 3.3 overs."

We are taking initiatives in this regard.""He added, ""In many places teachers don't want on-campus housing as the house rent allowance will then be deducted from their salaries.""Asked about teachers' allegations about having to join teacher politics, he declined to make a commentHe, however, admitted that many people refuse to work in newly established public universities due to the lack of residential and other facilities."

/tech-startup/science-gadgets-and-tech/tech-news/news/musk-offers-pay-44-bn-buy-twitter-3135391,Elon Musk offers to pay $44 bn to buy Twitter to end legal battle,"Elon Musk is abandoning his legal battle to back out of buying Twitter by offering to go through with his original $44 billion bid for the social media platform.The mercurial Tesla CEO made the offer in a letter to Twitter, which the company disclosed in a filing Tuesday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.The offer comes just two weeks before Twitter's lawsuit seeking to force Musk to go through with the deal goes to trial in Delaware Chancery Court.In a statement, Twitter said it intends to close the transaction at $54.20 per share after receiving the letter from Musk.Musk's proposal is the latest twist in a high-profile saga involving the world's richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms. Much of the drama has played out on Twitter itself, with Musk  who has more than 100 million followers  lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.A letter from Musk's lawyer dated Monday and disclosed by Twitter in a securities filing said Musk would close the merger signed in April provided that the Delaware Chancery Court ""enter an immediate stay"" of Twitter's lawsuit against him and adjourn the trial scheduled to begin in two weeks.By completing the deal, Musk essentially gave Twitter what it was seeking from the court  ""specific performance"" of the contract with Musk, meaning he would have to go through with the purchase at the original price. The contract Musk signed also has a $1 billion breakup fee.Eric Talley, a law professor at Columbia University, said he's not surprised by Musk's turnaround, especially ahead of a scheduled deposition of Musk by Twitter attorneys starting Thursday that was ""not going to be pleasant.""""On the legal merits, his case didn't look that strong,"" Talley said. ""It kind of seemed like a pretty simple buyer's remorse case.""If Musk were to lose the trial, the judge could not only force him to close the deal but also impose interest payments that would have increased its cost, Talley said.What did surprise Talley is that Musk doesn't appear to be trying to renegotiate the deal. Even a modest price reduction might have given Musk a ""moral victory"" and the ability to say he got something out of the protracted dispute, Talley said.News of the renewed offer caused trading of Twitter stock to be halted for much of Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange for ""news pending"" after it jumped nearly 13% to $47.93. That's still well below Musk's original offer. Trading halts are how stock exchanges give investors a forced timeout when trading for a stock gets too chaotic, or when a company is about to offer market-moving news.Neither Twitter nor attorneys for Musk responded to requests for comment Tuesday afternoon.Musk has been trying to back out of the deal for several months after signing on to buy the San Francisco company in April. Shareholders have already approved the sale, and legal experts say Musk faced a huge challenge to defend against Twitter's lawsuit, which was filed in July.Musk claimed that Twitter under-counted the number of fake accounts on its platform, and Twitter sued when Musk announced the deal was off.Musk's argument largely rested on the allegation that Twitter misrepresented how it measures the magnitude of ""spam bot"" accounts that are useless to advertisers. Most legal experts believe he faced an uphill battle to convince Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, the court's head judge, that something changed since the April merger agreement that justifies terminating the deal.Legal experts said Musk may have anticipated that he would lose. Things haven't been going well for him in court recently, with the judge ruling more frequently in Twitter's favor on evidentiary matters, said Ann Lipton, an associate law professor at Tulane University. The judge's denied several of Musk's discovery requests, Lipton said.It's also possible that Musk's co-investors in the deal were starting to get nervous about how the case was proceeding, she said.Musk's main argument for terminating the deal  that Twitter was misrepresenting how it measured its ""spam bot"" problem  also didn't appear to be going well as Twitter had been working to pick apart Musk's attempts to get third-party data scientists to bolster his concerns.Twitter now has options in the case and doesn't necessarily have to accept a new offer from Musk, said Robert Anderson, a law professor at Pepperdine University.""Twitter could still be concerned that the same thing might happen again without some additional security,"" Anderson said. ""They're going to want some assurance that the deal is going to happen right away.""Columbia's Talley said he would insist on Musk putting money into an escrow account until the deal is completed. Such an account could hold cash and/or Twitter shares, as a good-faith demonstration by Musk, Talley suggested.Mysteriously, neither Musk nor Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal have written anything about the deal on Twitter, where many developments in the dispute have been aired. Many of Musk's tweets in the past 24 hours have been about a divisive proposal to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine, drawing the ire of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Musk argued in a tweet Monday that to reach peace Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimea Peninsula that it seized in 2014. He also said Ukraine should adopt a neutral status, dropping a bid to join NATO following Russia's partial mobilization of reservists.If the deal does go through, Musk may be stuck with a company he damaged with repeated statements denoucing fake accounts, Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst for Hargreaves Lansdown in the United Kingdom, wrote in an investor note. ""This is an important metric considered to be key for future revenue streams via paid advertising or for subscriptions on the site, and his relentless scrutiny of Twitter's figures over the last few months is likely to prompt questions from potential advertising partners,"" she wrote.If Musk were to lose, among the remedies that would favor Twitter is a court order to go through with the deal. The Chancery Court last year forced private equity firm Kohlberg & Co. to go through with its $550 million buyout of DecoPac, a company based in Minnesota that calls itself the world's largest supplier of cake decorating supplies to professional decorators and bakeries. The case was emblematic of the court's common  though not uniform  resolution of enforcing contractual obligations on buyers.Other options include Musk being forced to pay the breakup fee each side agreed to if deemed responsible for the deal falling through. Or he might have to pay off a larger amount without actually buying the company for $44 billion."
/business/economy/news/small-fish-big-potential-3135171,Small fish with big potential,"The Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) has conserved and improved 37 domesticated varieties of freshwater fish over the past 30 years, bringing hopes that endangered breeds can be preserved to satisfy both local and global demand.Of the small indigenous species, some 11 were developed just last year and are already being exported overseas after catering to the domestic market, according to the BFRI sources.Some 64 of the 260 varieties of freshwater fish native to Bangladesh are already extinct while another 56 breeds have been listed as critically endangered since 1998 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.However, certain species domesticated by the BFRI are no longer endangered as they are now being cultivated by farmers on a large-scale.Around 5 lakh farmers are involved in cultivating small indigenous breeds with the required fish fry being produced at more than 500 hatcheries, said Yahia Mahmud, director general of the BFRI.Mahmud then said that roughly two crore people are either directly or indirectly involved with aquaculture in the country, which consumes about 42 lakh tonnes of fish each year.Around 30 to 35 per cent of the annual demand for fish is met by freshwater breeds, he added.Mahmud went on to say that certain varieties of fish have gone extinct over the years due to the drying up of their natural habitat amid changing weather patterns and other environmental perturbations.Bangladesh produced around 67,000 tonnes of fish in 2009 while it was 261,000 tonnes in 2021.""The amount is increasing every year as the cultivation of the conserved varieties of fish is gradually increasing at the farmers' level,"" he said.Experts say that some 80 per cent of the local demand for freshwater fish was met through rivers just two decades ago but now, the number has dropped to about 30 per cent as farmers cultivate certain varieties to make good profit in both local and international markets.Besides, it is very good news that fish production has increased four times in the last 12 years, considering the country's growing population, they said.Rashidul Hasan, principal scientific officer of the BFRI's Fresh Water Sub-Station in Syedpur, said the cultivation of small indigenous fish is attracting farmers as they offer reasonable profits at lower cost.As a result, breeds such as Bangladeshi Butterfish, climbing fish (Koi) and Gulsa are being cultivated on a large-scale, making these fish easily available now despite being scarce even a decade ago, he added.""Cultivation of the recently conserved Boirali fish has started in different areas of North Bengal,"" said Kohinoor, a retired director (admin) of the BFRI who worked on the conservation of small indigenous breeds.BFRI researchers claim that certain colourful varieties native to Bangladesh are mainly used as food but have good demand as aquarium fish in different countries.With this backdrop, there is a bright potential to export these breeds, they said.In addition, farmers have the opportunity to get good catches of these fish by producing them in ponds, which is comparatively cheaper than catching them from a river.The institute has so far developed 57 aquaculture and management technologies and most of them have already been transferred to the field level to help increase overall fish production.The institute has also successfully researched Thai Pangas, GIFT tilapia, native and exotic carp and non-carp species, and mud eel for commercial production.The cultivation of these fishes has commercially been successful at the farmers' level and the BFRI is supporting them by delivering fish fry, seed and technologies when they need, said Robiul Awal, senior scientific officer of the BFRI.""The native fish varieties are nutritionally dense and more flavoursome,"" said Selina Yesmin, another senior scientific officer of the BFRI.The institute has also taken short-term, mid-term and long-term projects to domesticate the remaining endangered varieties to meet the country's nutritional requirement and maintain its history and tradition, according to David Rintu Das, principal scientific officer of the BFRI's Fresh Water Sub-station in Bogura.Subhash Chandra Chakraborty, a professor of the fisheries technology department at Bangladesh Agricultural University, said fish exports are increasing and expatriate Bangladeshis are the main consumers of it.If this trend continues maintaining the desired quality, the export scale will surely be expanded in the future, he added.Chakraborty also said the natural breeding spots of indigenous fish are being destroyed by the indiscriminate use of chemical fertilisers and insecticides.Rezaul Islam Rony, a fish farmer in Mymensingh's Iswarganj upazila, said he earned good profits from cultivating small indigenous fish since 1999.""I cultivate the fish in 65 ponds and they are cheaper to produce compared to varieties of carp,"" he added.Rony also produces fish fry that are supplied to different districts of the country, including Rajshahi, Natore, Sirajganj and Sylhet.Sabuj Mia of Guilakanda village and Tajul Islam of Dekuarcahr village in Iswarganj upazila also expressed satisfaction over their cultivation of small indigenous fish.They said native breeds are more disease resistant than other varieties and thanked the BFRI for its all-out support.The two fish farmers then said they saw a marked rise in production after adopting modern techniques from the institute.The BFRI established a ""live gene bank"" for the conservation of small indigenous fish in 2020 and so far, 102 species have been included.""If any species is lost from nature, the bank will breed these in hatcheries and release them in open water bodies for natural regeneration,"" said Yahia.The institute was awarded with the ""Ekushey Padak"" in 2020 and it also received the ""Rtv-NRBC Bank Sammanona-2022"" for its outstanding research in the fisheries sector. "
/business/economy/news/apparel-export-can-hit-95b-2030-riding-mmf-3135196,Apparel export can hit $95b  by 2030 riding on MMF,"Apparel exports from Bangladesh will cross $95 billion by 2030 if the country can expand its share in the global market for manmade fibre (MMF) to 12 per cent from less than 5 per cent at present, according to a recent study.MMF apparel items accounted for $222 billion of the $440 billion global garments market last year, when cotton-based products contributed $190 billion.As such, almost half of all apparel exports worldwide are of MMF products while 42 per cent are cotton-based garment items.However, the picture is reverse in Bangladesh, where 72 per cent of the garment exports are cotton-based apparels and just 24 per cent are MMF, the study said.Of the total $42 billion apparel exports from Bangladesh in the last fiscal year, $30 billion were cotton-based garment items Of the total $42 billion apparel exports from Bangladesh in the last fiscal year, $30 billion were cotton-based garment items Mohammad Abdur Razzaque, research director of the Policy Research Institute (PRI) and author of the study, presented the outcomes at a programme on ""Man-made fibres for moving up the apparel value chain in the context of LDC graduation"".The event was organised by the planning ministry at the National Economic Council auditorium in Dhaka yesterday.Of the total $42 billion apparel exports from Bangladesh in the last fiscal year, $30 billion were cotton-based garment items.Bangladesh already accounts for 16 per cent of all cotton apparel shipments worldwide and the country will soon become the largest cotton-based garments exporter as China, the largest supplier at present, has been losing its market share.Global MMF apparel exports grew by 4 per cent while that of cotton-based items shrunk by 0.5 per cent annually between 2011 and 2019.Cotton apparel exports then fell by some 15 per cent in 2020 while MMF garment shipments saw robust growth of 8 per cent in 2021.The share of MMF apparel exports from China increased from 37 per cent of the country's total garment shipments in 2010 to 74 per cent in 2021.Similarly, the share of MMF apparel shipments rose to 57 per cent from 38 per cent in Vietnam, 32 per cent from 15 per cent in India, and 26 per cent from 13 per cent in Cambodia at the same time.Meanwhile, the share of MMF garments sent from Bangladesh increased to 24 per cent from 18 per cent of the country's apparel exports during the period, the study said.The global demand for MMF-based apparel items has been growing because of uncertainty in cotton production and supply, price comparability, and certain advantages offered by such products, namely higher durability, water and wrinkle resistance, and colour retention.Other reasons include environmental concerns, the fact that 2,700 litres of water are needed to produce a single cotton t-shirt, use of pesticides in growing cotton, and plastic recycling advantage of MMF.Global fibre production stood at 109 million tonnes in 2020, when manmade synthetic fibres accounted for 68 per cent (close to 80 million tonnes). MMF production worldwide is expected to reach about 110 million tonnes, by 2030, when the market will be worth around $100 billion compared to $62.7 in 2021.To tap into this market, Bangladesh needs to build its backward linkage capacity, Razzaque said.MMF currently comprises around 30 per cent of Bangladesh's total fibre imports with China being the largest source.Razzaque then suggested making the most of the few remaining years that Bangladesh will enjoy trade benefits as a least developed country (LDC) by offering additional cash incentives for MMF apparel exports and attract foreign investment in the sector so that the country becomes a regional supply hub.Planning Minister MA Mannan said the government has been considering paying more cash incentive to MMF-based apparel exporters as the garment sector is considered a strong component to address the challenges of LDC graduation.However, he did not say exactly how much the cash incentive would be increased as local manufacturers have already demanded 10 per cent cash incentives on export receipts of MMF to grab more of the global market share and attract foreign and local investment in the sector.The minister also said the cash incentive given on export receipts should be disbursed equally as other sectors deserve equal benefits."
/sports/football/news/cant-wait-read-newspaper-again-klopp-3135491,Can't wait to read newspaper again: Klopp,"Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp praised his team for riding out recent criticism of their dip in form to register a comfortable win over Rangers in the Champions League on Tuesday.Last year's Champions League and English Premier League runners-up have had a faltering start to the season, losing their opening game in Europe to Napoli and sitting a relatively lowly ninth in the domestic competition.But they brushed aside their Scottish opponents at Anfield with a 2-0 victory that would have been a bigger margin had it not been for Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's heroics.""I liked the game a lot. We got three points. That's the important thing,"" Klopp said, looking happy but more subdued than usual after a European win that left Liverpool second in Group A on six points after three games.""I can't wait for the moment when I can read newspapers again. But the criticism is completely fine. We are not over the moon about our situation,"" he said of the reaction to Liverpool's latest leaky performance in a 3-3 draw at home to Brighton at the weekend.""I saw tonight a team fully committed, that's what I like a lot. It was exactly what we needed tonight. A new formation, we had to change things. We had plenty of chances, imagine if we had taken more of them. Really good game. Very important.""We expected a reaction. Everyone expected a reaction. We really want to turn this into a positive and for that we need consistency. For that, you need top-class defending and we had that tonight. It worked out pretty well."" Right back Trent Alexander-Arnold has been particularly under fire of late for Liverpool, criticised for leaving gaps in defence as he marauds forward.Yet he got it all right on Tuesday, scoring a spectacular free kick to set Liverpool on the path to victory while also helping to keep a clean sheet.""He played a good game, defensively especially. And a wonderful goal, eh? I am happy that he had that,"" said Klopp, noting some tweaks in the formation to give Alexander-Arnold more cover when he went forward.""We take risks. We were not in the perfect moment, that's why we adjusted it.""Klopp, whose team are three points behind Napoli in Group A though still in a qualifying position, said he expected a very different game when Liverpool face Rangers in Scotland next week. ""We respect them a lot,"" he said.He was delighted with his front four of Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota.""The way the boys moved up front today was extremely good,"" he said, saying Nunez was bound to score soon after a string of saved shots against the Scots.""Two set piece goals as well - I love this as it means you don't need to wait for VAR!"" he quipped of Alexander-Arnold's free kick and Salah's penalty."
/environment/natural-resources/energy/news/half-the-country-blacked-out-3135131,Blackout hits half the country,"The country yesterday suffered the worst power outage in eight years, which, according to officials, was triggered by a trip at a substation in Ghorashal.It disrupted industrial production, water supplies and telecommunication services in more than half the country.Millions suffered in sweltering heat as most areas in Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet, and Mymensingh divisions were left without electricity for up to eight hours from 2:00pm.Besides, there were uncertainties as to when  power would be restored as the authorities didn't issue any detailed statement clearing up things until around 6:00pm.A spokesperson for Bangladesh Power Development Board said around 10:00pm that engineers were able to restore the electricity supply in 90 percent of the affected areas.As of 12:30am, power disruptions were still being reported in some parts of the capital.The power, energy, and mineral resources ministry in a statement last night said power supply started getting restored in some areas of Dhaka after 5:15pm.Power Division Secretary Habibur Rahman said the problem began at a substation near Ghorashal when the demand for electricity suddenly dropped, causing a power surge that tripped power stations one after another.""We will be able to come up with the exact cause very soon,"" he told The Daily Star.A power trip happens when an electrical circuit gets a load beyond its capacity, according to experts.Prominent energy expert Prof M Shamsul Alam said the National Load Dispatch Centre, which is supposed to coordinate the generation, transmission and distribution of power, often remains helpless because it is not provided with proper data by power generators and distributors.When the dispatch centre fails to ensure coordination, a risk of grid failure arises.If the voltage is not controlled, the electrical frequency cannot be controlled, and when the frequency rises or falls beyond a certain range, power stations trip one after another.Also, the frequency stability should be controlled automatically, but it is done manually here, he said.The Power Grid Company Bangladesh (PGCB) last night formed a five-member committee to find out what caused the failure and asked it to come up with its findings by Friday.Contacted, Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, said, ""It was a grid failure. We need a technical report to know what happened. I asked the secretary of the power division to form two separate committees in this regard.""Although the state minister assured that power supply would be restored by 7:00pm in Dhaka, vast areas of the capital were without electricity till 9:30pm.On September 7, nearly one-third of the country was left without power for about 40-60 minutes because of a grid failure.On November 1, 2014, the entire country suffered an outage because of a glitch in the Bheramara Power Plant.Yesterday's outage affected production in garment factories and small and medium industries. Patients suffered in health facilities that have no generator backup, our correspondents reported.Thousands of people couldn't make phone calls or access the internet while many ATM machines stopped working as the cell phone towers ran out of battery backups.In the capital, long queues were formed at the petrol pumps as people sought fuel for generators while Puja celebrations were affected in many places."
