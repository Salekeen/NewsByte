/business/news/bangladesh-earned-136-crore-exporting-hilsa-india-year-3136426,Bangladesh earns $1.36 crore exporting hilsa to India this year,"Bangladesh government has earned US$ 1.36 crore from exporting 1,352 tonnes of hilsa fish to India this year so far, Fisheries and Livestock Minister SM Rezaul Karim said today (October 6, 2022).Hilsa production has doubled in last 12 years and the rate of production is now 90 percent, he said.The minister revealed this information while speaking at a press briefing on 'Mother hilsa conservation drive 2022', held at the Secretariat.Like every year, the government is going to impose a 22-day ban on hilsa fishing -- from tomorrow (October 7,) to October 28, he said.Hilsa catching, selling and transporting will remain prohibited in the 7,000 square km area during the period to ensure the safe spawning of the hugely popular fish during its peak breeding period, he added.""Those found violating the law will face legal action including imprisonment and fine. None will be spared,"" said the minister.Besides, the government will take strict action against those involved in creating any obstruction on the development of hilsa resources.During this ban period all activities including catching, selling and transportation of hilsa will be prohibited in 20 districts including Chandpur, Lakshmipur, Noakhali, Feni, Chattogram, Cox's Bazar, Barishal, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barguna, Pirojpur, Jhalakathi, Bagerhat, Dhaka, Shariatpur, Madaripur, Faridpur, Rajbari, Manikganj and Munshiganj, he said.The ice factories of the districts will be closed as well during the ban, he added.Meanwhile, fishermen of 18 districts including Gopalganj, Narayanganj, Narsingdi, Kishoreganj, Tangail, Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, Pabna, Sirajganj, Natore, Bogura, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Brahmanbaria, Khulna, Kushtia, Narail and Jamalpur districts will be allowed to catch other fish except hilsa.Mobile courts will conduct drives day and night in all rivers of 38 districts, fisheries ghat, wholesale markets, chain shops and other markets to discourage people from catching and selling hilsa fish, he said.Alongside police, local administration, Navy personnel, Air Force, Coast Guard, Rab, river police and Fisheries Department will jointly conduct the drives.Meanwhile, dredging work in different rivers will be suspended during this period to ensure smooth spawning of hilsa, he said.Hilsa, the national fish of Bangladesh, is recognised as a certified patented product of Bangladesh.Nearly 6 lakh people of Bangladesh are involved in catching hilsa directly while 20-25 lakh people are involved in transporting, selling and other activities indirectly.Thanks to government initiatives, production of hilsa has increased to 5.65 lakh metric tonnes in 2020-21 fiscal year while it was 2.98 lakh metric tonnes in 2008-09 FY.Last year, nearly 51.76 percent of mother hilsa were able to lay eggs during the ban period, boosting production and hilsa export to India."

Her statement on JP's participation in the election does not have any importance,"" GM Quader told The Daily Star today.Raushan Ershad does not represent the party and those who are with her also do not belong to the party, he added.""I, therefore, think her (Raushan) statement will not create any influence in the party and Jatiya Party remains united,"" he further said.Without mentioning JP chief GM Quader's name, Raushan in her six minutes video, alleged that the party has become weak and disorganised after the demise of JP founder HM Ershad.""The party is running properly. The organisation will have to be strong,"" she said, urging all JP leaders and activists to get united to bring good result in the next general elections.Raushan said the aim of the next council to be held on November 26, 2023 is to infuse new and young faces in the party to make the organisation strong.Golam Moshi in the briefing blasted JP top leaders who said Raushan is acting on instruction of certain people who do not belong to Jatiya Party.Out of ten leaders who were present at yesterday's briefing on the stage, eight were presidium members and two were vice president of JP.Almost all of them were given relived from the party in the last three years as they were siding with Raushan, party insiders said.Quader in the last three weeks expelled at least three senior leaders including opposition chief whip Mashiur Rahman Ranga from their posts.In this situation, tension between the two sides increased further, sources in JP told The Daily Star.Rift between Raushan, widow of JP founder HM Ershad and GM Quader, younger brother of Ershad started brewing following Raushan's announcement of holding the party's council.JP Chairman GM Quader recently on several occasions unequivocally said they are against using EVMs in the national polls slated for January, 2024 as according to him EVMs are nothing but a tool for forgery.On September 25, Quader said JP would not participate in any elections if EVMs are used."
/business/news/further-delaying-climate-policies-will-hurt-economic-growth-3136506,Further delaying climate policies will hurt economic growth,"The world must cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least a quarter before the end of this decade to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Progress needed toward such a major shift will inevitably impose short-term economic costs, though these are dwarfed by the innumerable long-term benefits of slowing climate change.In our latest World Economic Outlook, we estimate the near-term impact of different climate mitigation policies on output and inflation. If the right measures are implemented immediately and phased in over the next eight years, the costs will be small. However, if the transition to renewables is delayed, the costs will be much greater.To assess the short-term impact of transitioning to renewables, we developed a model that splits countries into four regions—China, the euro area, the United States, and a block representing the rest of the world. We assume that each region introduces budget-neutral policies that include greenhouse gas taxes, which are increased gradually to achieve a 25 percent reduction in emissions by 2030, combined with transfers to households, subsidies to low-emitting technologies, and labor tax cuts.The results show that such a policy package could slow global economic growth by 0.15 percentage point to 0.25 percentage point annually from now until 2030, depending on how quickly regions can wean off fossil fuels for electricity generation. The more difficult the transition to clean electricity, the greater the greenhouse gas tax increase or equivalent regulations needed to incentivise change—and the larger the macroeconomic costs in terms of lost output and higher inflation.For Europe, the United States, and China, the costs will likely be lower, ranging between 0.05 percentage point and 0.20 percentage point on average over eight years. Not surprisingly, the costs will be highest for fossil-fuel exporters and energy-intensive emerging market economies, which on balance drive the results for the rest of the world. That means countries must cooperate more on finance and technology needed to reduce costs—and share more of the required know-how—especially when it comes to low-income countries.In all cases, however, policymakers should consider potential long-term output losses from unchecked climate change, which could be orders of magnitude larger according to some estimates.In most regions, inflation increases moderately, from 0.1 percentage point to 0.4 percentage point. To curb the costs, climate policies must be gradual. But to be most effective, they also need to be credible. If climate policies are only partially credible, firms and households will not consider future tax increases when planning investment decisions.This will slow the transition (less investment in thermal insulation and heating, low-emitting technologies, etc.), requiring more stringent policies to reach the same decarbonisation goal. Inflation would be higher and gross domestic product growth lower by the end of the decade as a result. We estimate that only partially credible policies could almost double the cost of transitioning to renewables by 2030.INFLATION AND MONETARY POLICYA pressing concern among policymakers is whether climate policy could complicate the job of central banks, and potentially stoke wage-price spirals in the current high-inflation environment. Our analysis shows this is not the case.Gradual and credibly implemented climate mitigation policies give households and firms the motive and time to transition toward a low-emission economy. Monetary policy will need to adjust to ensure inflation expectations remain anchored, but for the kind of policies simulated, the costs are small and much easier for central banks to handle than typical supply shocks that cause a sudden surge in energy prices.Using the United States as an example, we show how climate policies impact inflation and growth under a range of scenarios. When policies are gradual and credible, the output-inflation trade-off is small. Central banks can choose to either stabilise a price index that includes greenhouse gas taxes or let the tax fully pass through prices. The former would only cost an additional 0.1 percentage point of growth annually.If the transition is more difficult—reflecting a slower transition to clean electricity generation—the trade-off increases but remains manageable.The costs would be much higher if monetary policy were to lose credibility, a concern in today's high-inflation environment. If inflation expectations become de-anchored, introducing climate policies could lead to second-round effects and a larger output-inflation trade-off, as illustrated by the less-credible monetary policy scenario.Our analytical chapter shows how to design climate policies to avoid such a situation, curbing the impact of the greenhouse gas tax on inflation with subsidies, feebates or labor tax cuts. Is it reasonable to wait—as some have proposed—until inflation is down before implementing climate mitigation policies?We ran a scenario delaying implementation until 2027 that still achieves the same reduction in cumulative emissions in the long term. The delayed package is phased in more rapidly and requires a higher greenhouse gas tax, since a steeper decline in emissions is necessary to offset the accumulation of emissions from 2023 to 2026.The results are striking. Even in the most favourable circumstances when monetary policy is credible and the transition to decarbonised electricity is rapid, the output-inflation trade-off would rise significantly; GDP would have to drop by 1.5 percent below baseline over four years to drive inflation back to target.Delay beyond 2027 would require an even more rushed transition in which inflation can be contained only at significant cost to real GDP. The longer we wait, the worse the trade-off.Better understanding the near-term macroeconomic implications of climate policies and their interaction with other policies is crucial to enhance their design. Transitioning to a cleaner economy entails short-term costs, but delaying will be far costlier.Benjamin Carton is a senior economist in the International Monetary Fund's research department.

Fahima Khatun, Sanjida Akter and Rumana Ahmed picked up two wickets each during an all-round bowling effort from the Tigresses. Earlier Bangladesh posted 129 for five with Murshida Khatun and skipper Nigar Sultana hitting fifties."

It will be slashed to 160km via Jatrabari-Padma Bridge-Kalna Bridge, another RHD official said.Moinul said opening of the 3rd Shitalakhya Bridge will directly connect the Dhaka-Chattogram Highway with Dhaka-Mawa-Bhanga Expressway.As a result, vehicles from southern districts would not need to come to the capital's Jatrabari for going to Chattogram, he said adding that although the connecting road is not a wide one but they will take project for expanding the road.RHD in May 2016 took up a project titled Cross-Border Road Network Improvement Project with a soft loan from Japan.The Kalna bridge over the Madhumati River, which is among 17 bridges being constructed under the Tk 3,745.51-crore project, will cut short the travel time between Dhaka and Jashore.The government later named the bridge as Modhumoti Bridge.People are now using ferries to cross the river at Kalna point.The physical work of the 690-metre bridge started in November 2018 at the cost of Tk 959.45 crore. This is a Nielsen-Lohse arch type steel bridge, which is 27.10m wide, and the first six-lane bridge of the country.The Shitalakhhya river separates Bandar upazila from the Narayanganj district headquarters.The only direct road connection is through the Kanchpur Bridge (Shitalakhhya-1 Bridge), which currently requires nearly 30km of travel, according to RHD documents.Once the four-lane bridge with walkways is opened to public, commuters will have to travel less than two kilometres to reach Narayanganj city from Bandar upazila.RHD in November 2010 initiated the bridge project with Saudi Arabia's funding. But it took over seven years to hire consultants and contractors before the physical works started in late 2017.The 1234.5m bridge with 834.5m viaduct is formally named as Bir Muktijodhhda AKM Nasim Osman 3rd Shitalkhhya Bridge."
