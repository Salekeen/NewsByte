/star-holiday/news/kashmir-heaven-earth-3137896,Kashmir a heaven on earth,"After passing the passports and tickets to an immigration officer at Dhaka airport, I was lost in thoughts reflecting on the last couple of years. Though the worst days of the Covid-19 pandemic were over, the stagnant, restricted life was still vivid in my memory.How we all yearned for a pandemic-free world of unrestricted travelling!A benign cough from the immigration officer brought me back to the present.  ""Hello, Covid vaccine certificate please, ""he asked, reminding me of the post-pandemic ""new normal"" rules.During the pandemic, like many, I too had planned many trips in my mind. An opportunity came during the long Eid-ul-Fitr vacation and, my wife and I took it.  We were at the airport for a three-day trip to Kashmir.We reached Delhi after a two and half hour's flight. We grabbed a quick meal utilising the 2 hours before our next flight to Srinagar.Delhi to Srinagar was a 1.45-hour flight and an hour into it, Kashmir started to reveal its glamour and grandeur through the window. The views of the majestic Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas from above were superb.At the parking lot of the airport, Ferdous Bhai, our tour guide and driver, was waiting for us with a smile on his face. To our surprise, he could speak little Bengali.The beauty of the spring season in Kashmir kept our tired eyes open throughout our two-hour journey to Pahalgam, where stayed for the night.Located about 100 kilometres from Srinagar, Pahalgam, the jewel of the picturesque Liddar Valley located in the high Himalayas, is famous for its scenic beauty. By the time we reached there, it was already dark. After dinner, we had a walk in the near-empty local market.The next morning, on ponies, we set out for Aru Valley. 12 kilometres from Pahalgam, many consider this place the most beautiful of all the tourist spots in the area.We enjoyed the pony ride on lush meadows surrounded by mountains with snow-capped peaks and pine forests.However, by the time we reached there, the weather turned gloomy and soon, it started raining. This apparent setback was a blessing in disguise.  We enjoyed the rain with cups of warm tea. It was wonderful.Our next destination was Betaab Valley, another popular location among tourists and even Kashmiris, previously known as Hagan Valley. The renaming of the valley happened after the shooting of a hit Bollywood film called Betaab there.The entire setting was very scenic with the Lidder River flowing right next to it. With crystal-clear turquoise water, the beauty of this fast-moving river is hard to describe.Unfortunately, we were not permitted to approach Chandanwari, a tourist spot 8 km further away from Betaab Valley, as landslides, a common incident during the early spring season, triggered by rain blocked the road.That day, we left Pahalgam and reached Srinagar, where we stayed for the night. Our next spot was Sonamarg, which is approximately 80km away from the summer capital of Kashmir.The presence of the Indian military was noticeable in Sonamarg as it was near the Kargil, a focal point of the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan. However, other than facing a few regular security checkpoints on the way, we didn't face any adverse situations.The journey to Sonamarg, a gateway of the ancient Silk Road that connects Kashmir with China, became a pleasure trip as Ferdous Bhai from his driving seat recalled all the famous movies which were shot on this road.After reaching Sonamarg, situated at an altitude of 2730m with huge Himalayan Mountains in the backdrop, we decided to trek towards Thajiwas Glacier.It took us almost three hours to trek to the glacier site, enjoying a few moments there and coming back. In the evening, we returned to Srinagar and spent some time at the night market nearby our hotel to collect souvenirs.On the next morning, we started for Gulmarg which means ""Meadow of Flowers"". Gulmarg crowns the world's highest golf course and is also a popular destination for skiing.We hired a local guide and rented ponies to get to Snow Point, where we enjoyed a sledge ride. While returning, we stopped at factory outlets to see how famous Kashmiri pashmina shawls were made.We returned to Srinagar that night.Our stay in a houseboat at the Dal Lake in Srinagar was the tour's highlight. With a touch of luxury, we loved our stay at the floating house. We experienced a tranquil, surreal sunrise at Dal Lake.Later in the morning, we hired a Shikara (boat) to explore the lake. We also embarked on a sightseeing tour in and around Srinagar and enjoyed some Kashmiri cuisines like Wazwan, Kashmiri Biryani – which were distinct in taste and colour due to the presence of indigenous spices.On the final leg of the trip, we did some quick shopping and then started for the Srinagar airport.Soon, a sense of gloom engulfed us. Many call Kashmir heaven on earth for a reason.How to go there: One can go to Delhi by bus, train or air given that you have an Indian visa. Expenditures: The three-day trip of two cost us around 150,000 BDT."
/news/bangladesh/news/countries-lecturing-democracy-werent-beside-bangladesh-during-its-liberation-momen-3138201,Countries lecturing on democracy weren't beside Bangladesh during its liberation: Momen,"Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen has said Bangladesh does not seek foreign advice, emphasising that Bangladesh is a nation that has fought and bled to establish democracy and justice, safeguarding people's rights.""I would advise them (foreign critics) to look in the mirror first before criticising others."" ""We don't want that much advice,"" he told reporters today (October 8, 2022) after attending a programme in Sylhet Sadar upazila.Without mentioning any country's name, he said many of them, who are giving lectures on human rights and democracy, were not beside Bangladesh when the nation fought for independence and struggled for establishing democracy, justice and human rights and when the people's voices were denied.Momen said the tendency of showing hegemony has increased when Bangladesh is walking towards a better position and doing better on the economic front.He said the government never indulges in any extrajudicial killings and does not want to see anyone gets disappeared, but accidents happen in all countries.""We are very serious so that such accidents do not happen,"" Momen said, adding that Sheikh Hasina's government stands ready to take steps as per the law against those responsible. The foreign minister expressed displeasure over a section of the media mentioning that the media people go to foreigners to ask questions on Bangladesh's internal issues.  "
/sports/cricket/news/tigresses-suffer-heavy-defeat-against-india-3138121,Tigresses suffer heavy defeat against India ,"Bangladesh lacked the ammunition in their batting as they failed to assail the challenging total posted by India in their Women's Asia Cup encounter at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Saturday. The Tigresses suffered a heavy 59-run defeat.    Chasing India's 160-run target, Bangladesh could only muster 100 for seven in 20 overs. Openers Fargana Hoque and Murshida Khatun stitched together a 45-run opening stand but took as many as 55 deliveries to do so, resulting in increasing the scoreboard pressure on the batters to follow who could never keep up with the required rate. Murshida departed in the 10th over after a 25-ball 21 while Fargana, who fell to a Deepti Sharma delivery in the 14th over, scored an uninspiring 40-ball 30. Skipper Nigar Sultana Joty tried to up the ante with her team-high 29-ball 36 but that never put any pressure on India. Other than the aforementioned three, no other batters were able to get to double-digit scores as Bangladesh suffered a heavy defeat. Earlier, a 44-ball 55 from opener Shafali Verma coupled with skipper Smriti Mandhana's 38-ball 47 and an unbeaten rapid 35-run knock from Jemimah Rodrigues saw India pile up 159 for five.        "
/health/disease/news/dengue-grips-rooppur-plant-over-100-workers-infected-3138026,Dengue grips Rooppur Plant; over 100 workers infected,"Over hundred employees -- both foreigners and locals -- at Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant site have been infected with dengue since mid-September, while two other died of the disease in the past month.According to project officials, at least 30 workers are still receiving care at the project's hospital and other medical complexes.No larva of Aedes was found at the project site and anti-mosquito measures have been taken in this regard. that's why there is nothing to be concerned, sources said,However, Dr Asma Khan, Ishwardi upazila's health officer, told our Pabna correspondent that dengue outbreak began there in the middle of September. More than 100 patients have been admitted to this facility's dengue unit over the past few weeks.""The majority of the patients are site employees at the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, she said, adding that dengue claimed lives of two project workers last month.She continued by saying that many patients have been admitted to other hospitals and that although foreign workers were also infected. They are receiving treatment at the project hospital, she added.However, according to Ruhul Kuddus, site office manager, only about 30 workers have received treatment to date; foreign workers are receiving care under the direction of project doctors. The Russian construction company has already been informed of the issue and the current situation.Engineer Ashraful Islam, site director of the plant, said that even though some workers have the illness, it does not necessarily follow that they contracted it on the project site.""We instructed all the construction companies working on the project site to start taking initiatives against dengue when it out broke last month. To ensure that there is no stagnant water within the project area, project men constantly patrol every corner, he said.He claimed that project workers regularly spray medication to kill mosquito around the project area.Dr Asma Khan added that the health department has already collected samples from the project site and no dengue larva was found."
/business/economy/opinion/news/helping-families-cope-price-shocks-without-subsidies-3138021,Helping families cope with price shocks—without subsidies,"Amid ongoing food and fuel crises worldwide, general subsidies are making a big comeback as a way of delivering social protection to the population. In fact, according to a World Bank tracker, the number of social protection measures introduced in response to rising inflation almost tripled globally between April and September 2022. More than a third of these were subsidies, including for fuel, food, fertilizers, and fees (such as for electricity, water and heating services).The questions arise as to why subsidies are such a popular response, and why are they so difficult to reform. This puzzle lies at the centre of the discussions that will take place during the upcoming IMF-World Bank Group Annual Meetings (October 10-16). Ahead of these meetings, we offer some key points for consideration.It has been widely observed that subsidies tend to be politically popular for several reasons.First, most people benefit from subsidies, and thus, they may enjoy broader political support than programmes that benefit only a subset of the population.Second is transparency; for example, with an energy subsidy, consumers see the subsidised price on their energy bills.Third, since they are widespread and long-established, subsidies can be an appealing vehicle for responding to crises that affect most people and different sectors.Finally, governments can claim that they influence what people consume. For example, subsidising milk or eggs to ensure children get enough protein, rather than offering a cash subsidy that people may waste on so-called ""temptation goods"" such as alcohol or tobacco.However, subsidies are undesirable for a number of reasons. First and foremost, they are regressive—that is, they benefit richer families more than poorer families, and they are highly expensive. In addition, specific subsidies can have negative consequences. Fuel subsidies, for example, have serious environmental effects.Subsidising particular foods, such as bread, can backfire in terms of achieving balanced nutrition. It is far better to shift to transfers, and they should be in-cash not in-kind. And the idea that recipients waste cash on so-called temptation goods is not well supported by evidence, undermining much of the rationale for trying to influence spending.For these reasons, prior to the current global crises, many countries had been trying to move away from subsidies toward targeted cash transfers of various types. This trend should be accelerated.Why? First, cash transfers can be targeted to the households in various ways. Second, evidence shows cash transfers do not discourage work, often a key concern when it comes to those programmes. Finally, cash transfers generate local economic multipliers.With recent technological changes and improvements in social protection delivery systems, governments have more practical options for reaching people in need and can rely less on subsidies. While challenges exist, by applying various targeting methods countries can focus cash transfers on their most vulnerable population, or those who suffered the most as a result of the shock—or target more broadly.Having social protection systems in place that reach the most vulnerable is a great place to start the scale-up toward universality. This can also help in crisis: Leveraging existing systems is often by far the simplest and fastest social protection response in an emergency. But social assistance is only part of the story: Governments may also expand social insurance programmes to help households during shocks. Active labour market programmes like targeted wage subsidies can also help with the heavy lifting.At the same time crises can spark innovation. Often relatively broad, flat (or minorly customised) benefit designs can be used for crisis response programmes. This simplifies eligibility decisions and balances protecting poor people, helping a broader group of households cope with shocks, and other policy goals. There were many such innovations during Covid as countries sought to support people previously unreached by social protection. While there is no perfect system, there is enough evidence that social protection programmes can and do work, and it is time to use them to their full potential.Mamta Murthi is vice-president for human development at the World Bank, Michal Rutkowski is global director for social protection and jobs; and Ugo Gentilini is global lead for social assistance."
/entertainment/tv-film/news/dilbar-light-the-sky-nora-fatehis-rise-conservative-moroccan-family-3138061,From ‘Dilbar’ to ‘Light the Sky': Nora Fatehi’s rise from a conservative Moroccan family,"From ""Saki Saki"" to ""Dilbar"", the Moroccan beauty Nora Fatehi, ruled Bollywood with her scintillating dance moves and her enchanting performances. The ""queen of belly dancing"" became an international sensation with her twirls and whirls. However, her transformation to become a dancer wasn't an easy one; she had to pass significant obstacles to become one of the best dancers in Bollywood. Growing up, Nora was mocked and bullied for her dance moves. Her classmates would burst into laughter and mockery, after seeing her performance. This would break her heart, as the young girl would cry to her mother, to take her to dance lessons. However, her conservative Moroccan family wouldn't give her permission. The little girl was adamant that she would learn to dance, and thus, she started watching Youtube dance tutorials. In the end, persistence and perseverance win, and Nora Fatehi stormed into Bollywood as the reigning queen of 'item songs' in movies. Recently, the Bollywood diva has made headlines for her performance in the FIFA World cup music video. The actress is seen singing and dancing in Hindi and English in the ""Light the Sky"" music video with renowned musicians like Balqees, Rahma Riad, Manal & RedOne. Earlier, popular singers like Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, and Pitbull performed on the FIFA world cup stage. Nora is the first actress to represent South East Asia, India in particular, at the prestigious event in Qatar.Nora Fatehi was born and brought up in Canada. The young actress idolised Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan – and watched Arabic dubs of Bollywood films. She won many trophies at dance competitions in her college. When she had finished college, she received a phone call from a renowned dance institution to join their classes in the USA. However, her parents didn't grant her permission to go to school.Nora's father died after some time, and the entire responsibility of her family fell on the shoulder of the tender 18-year-old girl. The ""Kusu Kusu"" dancer started to work and send her dancing videos simultaneously across modeling agencies in India. After a year and a half, Nora got a call from an agency in Mumbai. Nora immediately packed her bags and sat on the plane to come to Mumbai in 2012.For the next two years, Nora worked in the Mumbai industry in a sporadic capacity. However, it took her five years to prove herself to her critics. The artiste was not proficient in Hindi at the beginning of her career, but now she has mastered the language very well. Apart from the Hindi film industry, she is also very popular in the South.The artiste, besides starring in music videos, has also become popular through her presence in reality shows ""Bigg Boss"", ""Jhalak Dikhla Ja"", ""Comedy Night"" and ""MTV Troll Police"".Nora's popularity has surpassed many B-town actresses. Some of her item songs include- ""Baahubali: The Beginning"", ""Kick 2"", ""Sher"", among others. The ""Dilbar"" actress doesn't want to stereotype herself in item songs only. She wants to prove her acting prowess through some quality movies. Nora is the first and only Moroccan star to have more than 2.2 million subscribers on her YouTube channel, where she creates comic skits only. "

He's obviously not the player he was when he was 22 or 23, for instance. It's a tough one for him.""Knowing him, it'll be very difficult for him to sit on the bench ... I'm sure if he stays patient, his chance will come and, again, it's then obviously him taking those chances and trying to force his way back in.""United, who are sixth in the standings with 12 points from seven games, face Everton in a league clash on Sunday."
/entertainment/tv-film/news/plus-means-positive-3138046,Plus means positive,"Tasnova Tabassum Parisa has proven that body types do not define beauty – it comes from the soul. The talented young woman won the title of ""Miss & Mrs Plus Bangladesh"". This plus size beauty pageant challenges the stereotypes of beauty standards and raises awareness against the culture of body-shaming.In an exclusive interview with Star Showbiz, Parisa talks about her journey as a plus size woman and more.How did you feel when you were announced as the winner?
When I was selected as the Top 5, I knew I could win this. But when they finally announced the winner, I went completely blank. I couldn't gather my scattered thoughts. I had to let it sink in. It was truly a magical moment.
What motivated you to join the pageant?



My biggest motivation was my mother. She always encouraged me to participate in extracurriculars. When I first heard about the pageant, I asked for her advice— should I join? She urged me to sign up for it immediately.
Since childhood, she made me learn how to sing and dance. I wanted to share these skills with the world. These are the reasons why I joined the pageant.  
You are also a dancer and a fashion influencer. Did you receive much criticism pursuing these, due to your body type?



Yes! Even as a child, I had to hear the jeering 'Why are you dancing with this body, you will break the stage'. I think all large girls can relate to this. Even now, when I am in live videos to promote products, people body shame me in the comments. Although I don't care much anymore, it is still hurtful.
 








Do you believe pageants like these can actually can help people fight against body shaming?
I think that the ""Miss & Mrs Plus Bangladesh"" pageant has already shifted people's mindset. Viewers are now more aware of the fact that body types have nothing to do with anyone's worth. People who would body shame me, now congratulate me.
I think this is a big change. There is still a long way to go, and we will need a lot of time to change the perspective of an entire community. But at least the pageant has opened a dialogue.
What changes can you identify within yourself?
I was always a person who loves herself. I'm like the character Geet in the film ""Jab We Met"". However, after the pageant, I find myself feeling more confident about my body. Now I know how to present myself in a more subtle manner. I feel less insecure about how I look, and more confident about how I am as a person.
 








How do you deal with hate comments on your social media?
I simple: I don't care. That's a good quality of mine, I will say. As I was active on social media for a long time and I am on the healthier side, these hate comments are my constant companion. I have found that the best way to tackle it, is to avoid it. I never let these hate comments come in my way.
What do you want to say to young people, who struggle with self-confidence due to body shaming?
I want to tell them is that you have to love yourself first. You have to embrace yourself as you are. You have to tell yourself every day that you are beautiful the way you are. You can never let anyone make you believe that you aren't.
 








What do you want to do to promote body positivity in the future?
Before the pageant, I didn't put much thought to promoting body positivity in particular. As I joined the pageant and participated in the grooming classes, I encountered many women who are depressed and anxious about their body type.
This made me want to help women work on their mental health— the way the pageant's grooming classes helped me grow more confident about my body. I want to open an institution where I can teach young girls take better care of themselves, and learn ways to be more presentable.
