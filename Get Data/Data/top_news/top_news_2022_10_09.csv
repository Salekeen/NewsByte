About 500 people attended its inauguration, including the prime ministers of different countries. The Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, also attended the session. Renowned Italian film director and author Lia Beltrami curated the exhibition.Hailing from Akkelpur in Joypurhat, Asaf Ud Daula unfurled the red-green flag of Bangladesh in front of the world's leaders in New York. The photographer captures the traditional form of evergreen Bangladesh.  His camera captures an idealistic form of climate change – also showing diversity and successive beauty of Bengal.Throughout September, Asaf spent a busy time for several solo exhibitions in both the continents of Europe and America -- ""Emotions to Generate Change"". Asaf could not physically join the exhibition of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, as he was representing Bangladesh with several solo exhibitions in the 25th edition of The Religion Today Film Festival in Europe. This event sa the participation of 25 countries from across the world.Along with the photography exhibition, photographer Asaf also led a day-long workshop on ""Photography Journey of Bangladesh"" for the film festival's guests, and other Italian delegates. In the 25th edition of this festival, two solo photography exhibitions of Asaf Ud Daula were held in Pinne (September 14-20) and Taranto (September 17-25) in Italy. In addition, another solo photography exhibition was held from September 14-22, 2022 courtesy of the 'Festival for Philosophy' in Carpi, Italy. All of these exhibitions of artistic projects were curated by the famous Italian filmmaker and author Lia Beltrami. These artistic exhibited projects were designed by Mauro Radici.""Our nature is full of words of love. In these artistic photographic exhibitions, climate change scenarios of Bangladesh have also been addressed,"" said Asaf.In October last year, on the occasion of COP-26, a solo photography exhibition titled ""Emotion to Generate Change"" opened in St. Peter's Square, Vatican City, which was inaugurated by the Pope Francis Jorge Mario Bergoglio on October 31. The exhibition featured 40 photographs, and was on display until November 5, 2021. As the chronology of this, another solo exhibition was held at the Salesian Pontifical University, Rome, Italy from 16-25 November 2021.  After that, Asaf's photographs were exhibited at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum-2022 in Davos, Switzerland, during May 22-29, 2022. Prior to this, on May 16, Monaco, Europe's second-smallest country, hosted a solo photography exhibition at the 16th Monaco Charity Film Festival.  In 2018, Asaf's first solo photo exhibition was held in ""Religion Today Film Festival"" in Trento, Italy where 33 photographs were showcased. That year, he was awarded the reputation of the best photographer of the year, 2018. Later in 2020, Asaf Ud Daula won an international photo contest titled 'The World's Best Photos of#Green2020' launched by Agora.Asaf is a resident of Shanta village of the Akkelpur Upazila in Joypurhat district. He received a 1.3-megapixel mobile phone from his uncle in 2008, and with this phone, he started his photographic journey. Back then, he had no idea what images and photography meant. After purchasing his first semi-SLR camera in 2012, he began studying online, attending workshops, traveling with senior photographers, and learning photographic grammar.The photographer has been featured in National Geographic, Forbes, Daily mail, Nat Geo, Geo Asia-Spain, Geo Asia, and other magazines.At present, he is working as a photographer at Rural Development Academy in Bogura.""I have tried to depict the picturesque beauty of Bangladesh, and the smiling countenance of her people. I feel thrilled thinking that people from all over the world are getting familiar with Bangladesh through the photos. I feel proud as a Bangladeshi to be able to raise the flag of Bangladesh all over the world,"" said Asaf Ud Daula."
/news/bangladesh/news/infrastructure-development-adb-ready-give-20b-has-concerns-3138336,Infrastructure development: ADB ready to give $20b but has concerns,"The Asian Development Bank is ready to give over $20 billion to finance Bangladesh's road and railway projects but raised concerns over the timely implementation of schemes.The Manila-based multilateral lender mentions the challenges facing implementation in a project portfolio review report submitted to the Bangladesh government last month.The report does not mention over how long the money will be disbursed.""Lack of comprehensive detailed design, including quality survey and investigation, contributes to significant scope changes, and time and cost overruns,"" it says.In some transport sector projects, appointing a contractor took over 20 months after the bidding was approved, it says, adding that the main cause of the delay was poorly prepared bidding documents.""Land acquisition and resettlement is one of the major reasons transport projects require time extensions,"" the report reads.It is taking longer for development project proposal (DPP) preparation or revision, submission of the DPP to the line ministry and approval by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), it says.The ADB presented an outline of projects in which it is likely to finance about $4.16 billion in the next three years.A decade ago, ADB's finance in the country's transport sector was $741 million. In August this year, the lender's finance in the sector was almost $3 billion, according to the report.Referring to certain projects, the ADB says approval of revised DPP took over a year causing delays in project implementation.The report cites a project titled ""Transport Connectivity Improvement Preparatory Facility"", for which the ADB approved a loan of $42 million in February, 2020.The loan agreement for the project was signed in June 2020 and the loan became effective in August that year. But no money has been spent from the fund yet. No consultants have been appointed to study the feasibility and finalise a detailed design of the project either.A $400 million fund for another project titled ""Dhaka-Sylhet Corridor Road Investment (trance 1)"", was approved by the ADB in September last year, but not a single penny has been utilised so far, the report says.Project implementation also gets delayed over complications of land acquisition and compensation to the affected individuals, it says, adding that delays also take place in selecting and deploying resettlement NGOs or consultants for those who are evicted for the project.Lack of understanding of FIDIC (International Federation of Consulting Engineers) contracts by the project management unit (PMU) or project implementation units (PIUs) staff, frequent changes of project directors, understaffed PIUs, and lack of coordination among supervision consultants and contractors delay the project implementation too.FIDIC rules are the standard forms of contract for use between employers and contractors on international construction projects.Poor supervision by consultants and repeated replacement of experts are responsible for weak contract management in many cases.Besides, the settlement of audit observations takes a long time, which results in non-compliance of financial management. Many audit observations are pending for a long time for most projects, the report observes.RECOMMENDATIONSThe ADB recommends strengthening the reviewing capacity of the implementing agencies and experts to improve the quality of project design, cost estimate, and procurement packaging.Dedicated management teams at PMUs and PIUs, who are familiar with and experienced in working with the ADB in areas that include procurement, financial management, and FIDIC contracts, should be assigned.The consultant recruitment and procurement should be streamlined.The ADB also suggests using its project readiness facility to improve design, procurement readiness and establishment of a management team.For land acquisition and resettlement, competent NGOs should be selected and the budget should be sufficient.The ministry concerned and the Planning Commission should take necessary measures to reduce the time for DPP and revised DPP or technical project proposal approval to expedite progress.To be able to meet the ADB's project readiness criteria, advanced contracting and retroactive financing may improve project readiness for approval and reduce the risk of implementation delays, it adds.The ADB has identified 16 road and railway projects the lender will finance in the next three years.The projects include Laksam-Chattogram Dual Gauge Railway Project ($300 million); Dhaka-Sylhet Corridor Road Investment Project ($500 million); Dhaka Northwest Corridor Road Project-Phase 3 ($400 million); Line 5, Southern route of Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Development Project ($300 million); Phase 1 of Dhaka-Cumilla Chord-line Project ($300 million); Phase 1 of Dhaka-South Corridor Road ($400 million); Dhaka-Chattogram PPP Highway Project ($400 million); and Phase 2 of Dhaka Northwest Corridor Road Project ($200 million)."
/business/economy/news/labour-migration-may-exceed-pre-covid-levels-3138511,Labour migration may exceed  pre-Covid levels,"The growing number of people from Bangladesh registering for work overseas indicates that international migration from the country may soon surpass pre-pandemic levels, according to a recent report by the World Bank.Around 600,000 locals registered for overseas employment in the first six months of this year while there was a total of 617,000 migrants in 2021.In the five-year leading up to Covid-19, the number of people from Bangladesh going abroad for work stood at an annual average of about 750,000.Besides, the recovery of international migration is somewhat stronger in Bangladesh compared to that of other South Asian countries, as per the report styled ""Coping with Shocks: Migration and the Road to Resilience"", released last Thursday.However, data on overseas work permits issued in the first half of 2022 shows that other than Bangladesh, the flow of migration from Pakistan may also surpass what it was in the pre-pandemic era.Some 400,000 people from the country registered for work abroad in this year's January-June period while the number was just 240,000 in 2021, down 63 per cent compared to an annual average of about 657,000 during the five years prior to Covid-19.Meanwhile, around 100,000 migrants from Sri Lanka had registered for overseas employment in 2021, which was more than double the number that went abroad the year before.Around 41.2 million South Asians were living outside their country of birth just before the coronavirus pandemic began in 2019, the report shows.In certain countries such as Nepal and Sri Lanka, the number of foreign job seekers is close to 10 per cent of their total population.Additionally, Bangladeshi migrant workers spent an average of more than $3,000 to move abroad before the pandemic, the report shows.It goes on to say that migration exposes South Asians to various risks because of the precarious labour market conditions that poor migrant workers face.For example, the legal (visa) status of migrants in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the most common international employment destination for South Asians, is contingent on their holding temporary jobs in low-skill sectors.Similarly, poor internal migrants in South Asia work largely in the informal sector, where they lack access to social protection.In parts of Bangladesh, approximately one-third of households out-migrate temporarily during the pre-harvest lean season.The flow of migrants represents the interaction of two economic forces: reallocation of labour to places where it is more productive, and adjustment to local economic shocks; both of which are central to inclusive and resilient development.Despite the importance of migration to individuals and the overall region, migrants in South Asia face considerable barriers to mobility.The Covid-19 crisis exposed this vulnerability on a large scale as migrants returning home during pandemic-related lockdowns faced multiple hardships.New survey-based evidence confirms that Covid-19 substantially slowed down new migration flows and created an unprecedented wave of return migration.Surveys also reveal that return migrants, especially women, struggled to assimilate into the home labour markets, resulting in high unemployment rates among the newly returned migrants.To ensure that migration can continue to play a key role in development and as a coping mechanism in the face of shocks, two policies deserve priority, the World Bank report says.First, it is vital to address unnecessarily high costs and frictions in migration, particularly those that might have worsened during the coronavirus crisis.The second main policy priority for the region is to learn from the pandemic experience and incorporate measures to ""de-risk"" migration into migration-supporting policies and institutions.In particular, because many poor migrant workers are employed in informal jobs, reforms to extend social protection to the informal sector should be designed to include migrant workers without deterring mobility."

/news/world/news/n-korea-fires-2-missiles-toward-sea-after-us-s-korea-drills-3138701,N Korea fires 2 missiles toward sea after US-S Korea drills,"North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters on Sunday, the latest of a recent barrage of weapons tests, a day after it warned the redeployment of a US aircraft carrier near the Korean Peninsula was inflaming regional tensions.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that it detected two missile launches Sunday between 1:48 a.m. and 1:58 a.m. from the North's eastern coastal city of Munchon. It added that South Korea's military has boosted its surveillance posture and maintains a readiness in close coordination with the United States.Japanese Vice Defense Minister Toshiro Ino also confirmed the launches, saying Pyongyang's testing activities are ""absolutely unacceptable"" as they threaten regional and international peace and security.Ino said the weapons could be submarine-launched ballistic missiles. ""We are continuing to analyze details of the missiles, including a possibility that they might have been launched from the sea,"" Ino said.North Korea's pursuit of an ability to fire missiles from a submarine would constitute an alarming development for its rivals because it's harder to detect such launches in advance. North Korea was believed to have last tested a missile launch from a submarine in May.The South Korean and Japanese militaries assessed that the missiles flew about 350 kilometers (217 miles) and reached maximum altitudes of 90 to 100 kilometers (56 to 60 miles) before falling into the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida separately instructed officials to gather and analyze all information they could and expedite any updates about the tests to the public. His office said it also was seeking to ensure the safety of all aircraft and ships in waters around Japan while preparing for any contingencies.South Korea's presidential office said National Security Director Kim Sung-han called an emergency security meeting over the launches where members reviewed the South's defense preparedness and discussed ways to strengthen cooperation with the United States and Japan to counter the growing North Korean threats.Seoul warned that Pyongyang's consecutive provocations will deepen its international isolation and increase the ""instability of the regime"" by worsening its economy and people's livelihoods.The US Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that the launches didn't pose any immediate threat to US personnel or territory, or to its allies. But it said the launches highlight ""the destabilizing impact"" of North Korea's unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. It said US commitments to the defense of South Korea and Japan remain ""ironclad.""The launch, the North's seventh round of weapons tests in two weeks, came hours after the United States and South Korea wrapped up two days of naval drills off the Korean Peninsula's east coast.The drills involved the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and its battle group, which returned to the area after North Korea fired a powerful missile over Japan last week to protest the carrier group's previous training with South Korea."
/news/bangladesh/news/load-shedding-situation-reality-contradicts-ministers-claims-3138341,Load-shedding situation: Reality contradicts minister’s claims,"Even though the countrywide power cuts are statistically more frequent at the moment compared to last month, State Minister for Power Nasrul Hamid announced that load-shedding has decreased.He said this while briefing journalists from his home on Friday.""Load-shedding has decreased from before, but it is still approximately 700-800MW per day,"" he said.Data on the daily load-shedding from Power Grid Company Ltd (PGCL) refute both claims.On that day (October 7), the power outage was 964MW, or eight percent of the total demand, which is slightly more than the 932MW that the authorities had estimated.A similar pattern can be seen for the entirety of October.Discounting last Tuesday when a grid failure caused a blackout in half the country, load-shedding on any day last week has been more than that in any day in September.On Thursday, it was nine percent of demand or 1,184MW. On that day, Dhaka suffered more outages among all divisions -- 429MW.The day before, the authorities estimated that approximately five percent of the demand would have to be shed. The actual outage was more than double that of that -- 11 percent or 1,375MW.According to the load-shedding schedule released by Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited for yesterday, most places in Dhaka and parts of the suburbs covered by the company would have experienced power cuts between three and five times in 24 hours.Narayanganj's Fatullah would have experienced the most outages; about eight times in those 24 hours.Places in Azimpur, Dhanmondi, Demra, Khilgaon, Moghbazar among others would have experienced outages about five times.Some of the load-shedding were scheduled after as late as 11:00pm.In comparison, power cuts in September were less than what was experienced just this week.Data shows that last month, there were as many as 19 days with almost no load-shedding at all.On other days, the rate of shedding hovered between two and four percent of the estimated demand.It was only towards the end of the month, on September 23, 25, and 28, that load-shedding began to get more prominent, with outages over 700MW.September 1 had the highest demand for electricity (14,026MW) and no load-shedding.The current demand is 1,350MW less but the government is unable to deliver, resulting in more outages.Bangladesh Power Development Board's Member (Generation) Mohammed Ashraful Islam attributed the outages to ""caution"".""Since we experienced a trip in the grid, we are wary of the load. We are generating about 10,000 megawatts of electricity every day and aim to take it up to 12,000."""

/news/bangladesh/transport/news/third-shitalakkhya-bridge-opens-tomorrow-3138401,Third shitalakkhya bridge: 3-year project finally done in 12 years,"Nine years behind schedule and costing 61 percent more, the Third Shitalakkhya Bridge is finally going to be opened to the public tomorrow.Roads and Highways Department in November 2010 had taken up the project to establish a direct link between Narayanganj city and Bandar upazila.It was supposed to be done by 2013 for Tk 377.62 crore, from Saudi Arabia.The project authorities, however, took over six years just to hire consultants and contractors and the work on the ground began in 2017.In the meantime, the project cost escalated to Tk 608.56 crore.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will open the 1.23km bridge to the public tomorrow.Time extension and cost escalations are nothing new for RHD projects and it exposes its weaknesses in implementing such work.A report of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division on 49 projects, completed in fiscal 2016-17, shows that 41 of them required time extension and suffered cost escalation.Taking up projects without proper feasibility studies and estimation of costs, long delays in the tender process, and dividing project work into ""small packages"" to benefit influential but non-professional contractors are among the key reasons behind the delays, the report pointed out.Delays in land acquisition, moving utility lines and frequent changes of project directors were also blamed for the poor show, the report said.In the last fiscal year, RHD completed 44 projects but only three were done within their original deadlines. Most of the other 41 missed their original deadlines by more than two years. Some got delayed by three to four years.WHY THE DELAY?The Shitalakkhya river is between Bandar upazila and Narayanganj city.The only direct road connection is through the Kanchpur Bridge (Shitalakkhya-1 Bridge), which currently requires nearly 30km of travel, according to RHD documents.Once the four-lane bridge with walkways is opened to the public, people will have to travel less than two kilometres to reach Narayanganj city from Bandar upazila.The Executive Committee of National Economic Council in November 2010 approved the project setting a cost of Tk 377.62 crore, of which 311.64 crore was supposed to be provided by Saudi Arabia as loan.But the project faced different problems including frequent changes of project directors and officials and long delays in getting approval from the Saudi side, sources at the RHD said.The current project director is the 10th of the project, they said.Project authorities had to go through the tender process twice to appoint consultants and contractors.After the second bidding, when the project authorities went for appointing the selected bidder, it was found that the Chinese company was banned by a multi-lateral lender, leading the authorities to go for the second bidder. The process also took time.The Covid-19 pandemic and the slow flow of money from Saudi Arabia are the other reasons behind the delay, they said.In the meantime, project cost rose to Tk 608.56 crore, largely due to the high cost of land acquisition.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation stone of the project in February 2015 and the project authorities signed an agreement with the Chinese company Sinohydro Corporation Ltd in February 2017.Once the bridge is in service, vehicles from southern districts would not need to got to the capital's Jatrabari to go to Chattogram, RHD officials said.However, RHD must expand the existing road for establishing a better link, they added."
/business/economy/news/knitwear-continues-dominance-export-3138516,Knitwear continues dominance in export,"The knitwear segment has retained its position as the country's biggest export earner in the readymade garment industry and among all the sectors of Bangladesh. But the journey has not been smooth.In its early years, it had to navigate through a quota system and securing raw materials was not easy as imports were the only option. Now it is facing mounting challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and the Russian war in Ukraine.The knitwear segment overtook the woven sub-sector for the first time in the financial year of 2007-08 and held the pole position until 2010-11.The woven outran the knitwear segment in 2011-12 and the dominance continued till 2019-20.In 2020-21, knitwear outran woven and recaptured the glory. And it continued in the last fiscal year as well as it brought home $23.21 billion, versus the woven's $19.40 billion.Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector 


Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector Even in July to September, the first quarter of the current financial year when the overall export earnings showed a falling trend, the knitwear segment grew 9.40 per cent year-on-year to $5.64 billion because of a strong demand amid the raging war and unprecedented inflation in the eurozone and the US.Local garment suppliers, primarily, attributed the change in fashion and style globally, to the continued success of the knitwear sector.Fast fashion and putting on casual dress have increased the use of knitwear items in the last one decade. Nowadays, even executives wear casual dresses at offices instead of formal ones. Knitwear like functional sportswear is used as dresses for formal events worldwide.Fashion connoisseurs prefer knitwear items since it is comfortable and easy to wash. Moreover, product diversification has taken place within the segment.When Covid-19 brought the entire world to a screeching halt and damaged the global supply chain severely and businesses hit rock bottom, the country's knitwear sector put on a good show, surprisingly, as Bangladesh kept supplying garment items to the world amid the raging flu.The segment also felt some damage.The slowdown in the knitwear shipment was first noticed in March 2020 when earnings stood at a paltry $1.05 billion. It fell further in April, to $180.2 million.But it rebounded in the following month as exporters fetched $608.38 million since people were forced to spend more time indoors to avoid catching the deadly virus. The receipts sprinted to $1.16 billion in June.""It was surprising that the demand for knitwear items started climbing even during Covid-19 when the global supply chain came to a standstill. In fact, knitwear export has continued to surge,"" said Md Fazlul Hoque, managing director of Plummy Fashions, a Narayanganj-based knitwear exporter.""The use of knitwear items has risen as consumers spent more time at home. During their long stay indoors, western consumers mostly use T-shirts.""Historically, the knitwear sector was groomed in Bangladesh because of the quota system which started in the late 1970s and was in place until 2004.In the early days, knitwear manufacturers, particularly those based in Narayanganj, used to ship knitwear items as the European Union granted the facility of a quota system that was not rigorous and was less cumbersome. So, a strong market was created for local knitwear items.In fact, Bangladesh made the most of the quota system, sowing the seed for today's gigantic knitwear industry.The EU and other developing and developed countries later eased the Rules of Origin for knitwear items, allowing the least-developed countries such as Bangladesh to qualify for the generalised system of preferences in the trade bloc even if imported cotton and yarn are used to ship export-oriented goods.This prompted knitwear producers to invest a lot of money in the sector and broaden their manufacturing prowess.Subsequently, entrepreneurs also pumped money to produce yarn and other raw materials for the knitwear sector.Currently, nearly 90 per cent of raw materials are procured from the local market, cutting reliance on China, a major feat for the industry as it more than halved the lead time.Even five years ago, the US was not a major market for knitwear manufacturers.""Today, the US has turned into a major export destination for us,"" said Hoque.Three years ago, the export of knitwear items from his factory to the US was almost zero whereas the world's biggest economy is his main buyer now.Mohammad Hatem, executive president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said demand for knitwear items has not fallen despite higher inflation in the eurozone and the US.Competitive prices are a major factor in Bangladesh's success in the knitwear sector.""The export of knitwear items has kept rising and the momentum will continue in the future as well,"" Hatem said.Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, expects the dominance of knitwear in exports to continue for the next few years as raw materials are easy to procure and the demand for casual wear has lifted the demand for knitwear products.Currently, more than 1,200 knitwear factories are in operation in Bangladesh, employing over 14.50 lakh workers."

A court decision in 2023 will be crucial in determining the project's future.""There are no football clubs among the ten richest entities in the world, we must be doing something very wrong in old Europe,"" Perez explained.Perez led a group of 12 major European clubs into the Super League project in April 2021 but it vanished a few days after it was announced after pressure from fans and authorities.The only clubs that have tried to keep alive a league that would be direct competition for the Champions League are Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus.Perez compared European football with tennis.""What is the point of depriving the fans of the big matches? Nadal and Federer met 40 times. Nadal and Djokovic, 59, is it boring? Liverpool and Real Madrid have faced nine times in 67 years,"" he told the Madrid's members assembly.The Super League project came back to life in July, when litigation for an alleged abuse of a dominant position by UEFA was brought to the European Union Court of Justice, at the request of a Madrid judge to whom the Super League chiefs turned.'Healthy and beautiful'UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin responded to Perez.""Once again he has shown that his idea is to close everything off, without games against smaller teams,"" he told a news conference in Rome.On Thursday, in a letter to shareholders, Agnelli, reaffirmed his ""commitment"" to the project and proposed ""establishing a direct link with sponsors who dare to take business risks, and control of economic resources.""On the same day, Barcelona presented their accounts and Eduard Romeu, their financial vice-president, said ""considering the Super League again would be positive.""That was followed by a Laporta interview with Sonora, reported by Marca, on Sunday.""A Super League would be an improved Champions League, with a better format, it would surely be the most attractive competition in the world,"" said the Barcelona president.However, Laporta said he would prefer not to have a closed format for the competition. ""We have to have an open Super League, where there's meritocracy,"" he said.""I think that the big clubs always playing each other would be tiring,"" he added. ""Those who like football among us, would end up tired. It's healthy and beautiful that a smaller team can beat a bigger team.""To back the underdog is very nice. You see a Euros won by Greece, and it's beautiful. And when Leicester won (the Premier League) in England it was special.""Success or failure?Opponents of the project have also spoken out.On Friday, UEFA and the European Commission announced the renewal of their cooperation agreement which ""aims to use European football as a force for positive change"" until 2025.To counter the Super League, UEFA announced a sweeping overhaul of the Champions League in May to start in 2024, with 36 teams instead of 32 and an eight-match mini-championship instead of the traditional group stage.The television rights will be sold for a projected 15 billion euros (14.6 billion dollars) for three years (2024-2027).""Sales of the new format in the US are up 150 percent. In the UK and France, not so much.

The final decision is expected near the beginning of 2023."
/world/europe/news/blast-damages-key-crimea-bridge-3138351,Blast damages key Crimea bridge,"Russia yesterday said three people were killed in after a truck exploded on its bridge linking Crimea -- a symbol of its annexation of the peninsula -- without immediately blaming Ukraine.On the same day, after Moscow suffered a series of setbacks on the battlefield that triggered unprecedented criticism of its army at home, Moscow appointed a new general to lead its Ukraine offensive.The blast ripped through the 19-kilometre bridge more than seven months into Moscow's Ukraine offensive, although local authorities said it had reopened to motor traffic with vehicles subject to stringent screening. Rail traffic also resumed.Dramatic social media footage showed the bridge on fire with parts plunging into the water.Russian investigators said three people were killed and that two bodies -- a man and a woman -- were pulled out of the water after the bridge had partially collapsed.They were likely to be passengers of a car that was driving near the exploded truck and their identities were being established, Moscow said.It had also identified the owner of the truck as a resident of Russia's southern Krasnodar region, saying his place of residence was being searched.Russia said the blast -- which occurred just after 6:00am local time -- set ablaze seven oil tankers transported by train and collapsed two car lanes of the giant road and rail structure.The bridge, personally inaugurated by President Vladimir Putin in 2018, is a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine.It is hugely important to the Kremlin, and Moscow had maintained the bridge crossing was safe despite the fighting.While some in Moscow hinted at Ukrainian ""terrorism"", state media continued to call it an ""emergency situation.""Ukraine's presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak earlier took to Twitter posting a picture of a long section of the bridge half-submerged.""Crimea, the bridge, the beginning,"" he wrote.""Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled.""The Ukrainian post office announced it was preparing to print stamps showing the ""Crimean bridge -- or more precisely, what remains of it"".The Kremlin's spokesman said Putin had ordered a commission to be set up to look into the blast on the bridge which is hugely symbolic and logistically crucial for Moscow.Officials in Moscow stopped short of blaming Kyiv.But a Russian-installed official in Crimea pointed the finger at ""Ukrainian vandals."" Another in the neighbouring Kherson region said repairs could ""take two months"".And the spokeswoman of Russia's foreign ministry said that Kyiv's reaction to the blasts showed its ""terrorist nature.""Some officials in Moscow and in Russian-occupied Ukraine called for retaliation.There have been several explosions at Russian military installations in the Crimean peninsula.Authorities in Crimea appeared to downplay the blasts and tried to calm fears of food and fuel shortages in Crimea, which is fully reliant on the Russian mainland since Moscow annexed it in 2014.The blasts come after Ukraine's recent lightning territorial gains in the east and south that have undermined the Kremlin's claim that it annexed Donetsk, neighbouring Lugansk and the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.After several weeks of crushing military stbacks, Moscow yesterday announced that a new general -- Sergei Surovikin -- would take over its forces in Ukraine.The decision -- made public in an unusual move -- comes after the setbacks on the battlefield led to growing discontent among the elite towards the army's leadership.This month, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov called for a top general to be fired in Ukraine after Russian forces lost control of the key city of Lyman. Senior Russian lawmaker Andrei separately urged officers to stop ""lying"" about the situation on the battlefield.Surovikin previously led Russia's forces in southern Ukraine. He has combat experience in the 1990s conflicts in Tajikistan and Chechnya, as well as, more recently, in Syria."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/fdcs-environment-has-been-spoiled-zayed-khan-3138726,FDC’s environment has been spoiled:  Zayed Khan,"Zayed Khan used to go to the BFDC everyday, while he was General Secretary for Bangladesh Film Artistes Association. However, it has been a while since he was seen there.The actor spoke to The Daily Star about his recent works and future plans. Where are you now?I am currently at my hometown Pirojpur, for some personal work. My parents' graves are going through repair work, and I am supervising it. What else were you busy there with in your hometown?I went to a cultural event arranged for Durga Puja in Nesharabad, Pirojpur. When people learned about my arrival, 30 thousand people visited the event, despite the heavy rain. Besides, I have planted hundreds of plants in different areas through one of my organisations.There was a time when you would visit Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC) everyday. However, now you are not seen in that place anymore. Why is that? It has been almost 3 months since I went there. Many think that I am not going to FDC because of fear.The fact is that the environment there has been completely spoilt. The beautiful vibe that we created, is gone. Now, many people including YouTubers have come there and completely spoiled the atmosphere. Everyone knows who allowed them to come here.But, you are accused of bringing these YouTubers to the FDC…No one can prove that I brought these YouTubers to FDC. I cannot explain how bad the situation there is. They are making ambiguous comments about anyone they wish, and they don't even hesitate to talk bad about Shakib Khan either. It is important to prevent them first. Sadly, no organisation from FDC is taking the necessary steps.What happened to the post of General Secretary of the Film Artistes Association?I respect the law. I will accept any fair decision taken by law. But, what is happening now is unfair. Nipun has unfairly occupied the chair. It's not right –  they don't care about the law. Senior actor Ilyas Kanchan accepts the unfair occupation, that makes it even more frustrating. People like director Sohanur Rahman Sohan and Mohammad Hossain are supporting them in various ways.More than a year is left for the election of the artistes association. Do you wish to participate again?Nothing happened in this election. Let there be a solution and then we can talk about the next election. Nothing can be said before that.When was the last time you faced the camera?  When do you plan to return to shooting?I shot for the movie ""Shonar Chor"", around 9 months ago, and that was before the election held for the Film Artistes Association. After returning to Dhaka, I will work on the dubbing for the project.

/business/economy/news/pubali-bank-tear-3138496,Pubali Bank on a tear,"At the time of its denationalisation in 1984, Pubali Bank's defaulted loans were more than 50 per cent owing to a lack of corporate governance. The bank set out to turn around from its fragile financial health and it has not had to look back since then.Today, Pubali Bank is one of the sound financial organisations in Bangladesh and non-performing loans (NPLs) have fallen to as low as 3 per cent, way lower than the industry average of more than 8 per cent.""But it was not a smooth journey as multidimensional efforts had to be taken to improve the health,"" said Safiul Alam Khan Chowdhury, managing director of Pubali Bank Ltd.He joined the bank as a senior officer in 1983 after completing his post-graduation from the University of Dhaka.After serving it for nearly four decades, he is set to retire tomorrow, joining a small group of banking professionals who spent their entire career in a single organisation and went on to helm the pole position.In fact, Chowdhury was the one who had first-hand knowledge of how the bank was rebuilt from the scratch. In fact, he played an active role in improving the financial health of the lender.""Our main aim was to fortify the corporate governance, helping the bank become vibrant,"" said Chowdhury in an interview with The Daily Star yesterday.Capacity development and the change in the mindset of the workforce have also played a crucial role in the transition of the bank. And all contributed to the reduction of NPLs drastically.Subsequently, it came out of the list of problem banks in 2005 and the Bangladesh Bank withdrew its observer two years later.At present, Pubali Bank is the highest profit maker among conventional private commercials bank in Bangladesh.Its net profit stood at Tk 435 crore last year, up 17.4 per cent a year ago. Operating profit surged to Tk 991 crore in the first nine months of 2022, versus Tk 771 crore generated during the identical period a year ago.""We have achieved all these without compromising corporate governance,"" said Chowdhury.He cited customer satisfaction as the main driver for the bank's stellar performance year after year. Pubali Bank has placed equal importance on mobilising deposits, selecting borrowers cautiously, and facilitating exports, imports and remittance flow in order to diversify earnings.Embracing modern technologies and digital solutions has put the bank on a higher growth trajectory.ICT-based initiatives of the Bangladesh Bank, customers' expectations and demand, and rapid advancement in information and communication technology have significantly influenced the banking industry in recent years.Thus, the lender, which was established in 1959, has taken a leading role when it comes to introducing a number of banking services provided digitally.In order to take banking services to customers, it introduced an app-based banking product named ""PI Banking"" in August 2020. An e-KYC (electronic know your customer) and an instant e-KYC-based account opening system have already been rolled out.""We have invested a lot to ensure security and use big data analytics, data mining and artificial intelligence to reshape our online banking,"" Chowdhury said.According to the veteran banker, technological advancement will be the key driver for growth in the banking sector in the coming years. So, Pubali Bank has decided to rely less on cash and workforce with a view to minimising costs.He also touches upon the ongoing stress in the country's foreign exchange market, driven by US dollar shortages amid higher imports and escalated commodity costs.""The central bank has taken some good initiatives such as the restrictions on importing luxury items, increasing the margin on letters of credit, giving incentives to remitters and exporters, and fixing the exchange rate for exports and remittance.""""The country needs to reduce imports through import substitution by utilising every available resource.""Chowdhury suggested exporters search for niche markets to increase export and create their own brands.""We also need to focus on the Indian market to raise our exports and narrow the trade gap. Congenial environment for doing business has to be created to attract foreign direct investment.""During his long career, he worked as a branch manager, regional manager, division head, chairman of the credit committee of the head office and in many other positions. He was promoted to the post of managing director from additional managing director in April last year.He singled out his four-year stint as a manager of the Motijheel Corporate branch as the most challenging time for his career. At that time, the bank was categorised as a problem bank because of its high volume of NPLs.Management realised that if two branches – the Motijheel corporate branch and the foreign exchange branch -- could eliminate huge losses, the result would be enormous and shake up the bank, paving the way for it to move out of the ignominious category of the problem banks.Chowdhury was given the charge of running the Motijheel branch.""I took up the challenge because I have always believed that there exists opportunity wherever there is a challenge. I gave my 100 per cent and within a short time, the branch became profitable.""""The success generated a huge momentum for the entire bank and sowed the seed for its current growth trajectory,"" Chowdhury said.In recognition of his honesty throughout his career, the board of Pubali Bank honoured him with the Integrity Award for the last fiscal year. The central bank also recognised Pubali Bank as a sustainable lender during his time at the top.Chowdhury's parting advice for the banking industry: ""Human resources have to be developed to equip themselves for the massive technological changes going through the financial industry. Banks will also have to find ways to mitigate risks."" "

/news/bangladesh/politics/news/work-public-servants-not-party-activists-3138331,"Work as public servants, not party activists","Amid allegations of bias, the Election Commission yesterday asked the deputy commissioners and superintendents of police to perform their election duties impartially.It also directed them to make sure no one is harassed for their political orientation during the next Jatiya Sangsad polls.At a meeting with the DCs and SPs at its office, the EC issued the directives regarding the upcoming zilla parishad polls, by-elections to two parliamentary seats and the next general election.The DCs discharge election duties as returning officers and the SPs, as the district chiefs of police, maintain polls-time law and order.The administration and law enforcement officials urged the EC not to use Electronic Voting Machines in remote areas, officials who attended the meeting told The Daily Star.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal said, ""We want free, fair and participatory elections. We told them [DCs, SPs] they will have to work impartially during the elections.""They must not behave in a way that would make people think they are biased and not non-partisan. As public servants, they have to understand the difference between the government and a political party.""Habibul said the DCs and SPs should never consider themselves party activists.Warning the officials, the CEC said the EC will strictly monitor the activities of the field-level officials. ""Any negligence of duty will not be tolerated.""In his written speech at the closed-door meeting, Habibul said it was unfortunate that many complaints have already been lodged about violations of the electoral code of conduct during the campaigning for the October 17 zilla parishad elections.""We have received numerous complaints of intimidation and threats … We want to firmly say that if illegal interferences, intimidations, and bias are not resisted, the elections will become a farce.""According to EC officials, there was a ruckus at the meeting when Election Commissioner Anisur Rahman was talking about allegations that many officials act out of bias while discharging their duties, and also in many cases, they do not spend the allocated budget properly.Expressing disappointment, the commissioner said several officials at the meeting talked about increasing their benefits, but they said nothing about allegations raised against the way electioneering for the zilla parishad polls is going on.""There are allegations that the officials work in league with the MPs and ministers. Many, while taking part in the talks with the Election Commission, also raised the allegations of the officials' bias …. have our officials become toothless?"" an EC official quoted Anisur as saying.The commissioner alleged that magistrates do not get the budget allocated for them as fuel cost. Several DCs protested his statement, said an SP.Anisur said he had proof of this and he won't speak if the officials didn't want him to. He then asked them if he would continue speaking. As  some officials said ""no"", the commissioner stopped.After the meeting, the CEC along with three other commissioners joined a  press conference, but Anisur was not there.This correspondent went to Anisur's office around 2:30pm for his comments but found he was away. He also didn't pick up the phone and answer text messages.Many opposition political parties, including the BNP, allege that massive ballot-stuffing took place on the night before the election day in 2018. They also allege that police and local administration officials, who carried out election duties, were either involved in ballot-stuffing or looked the other way.Electoral irregularities like stamping ballots the night before the polling day and ballot-stuffing by capturing booths took place in 47 out of 50 constituencies, found a TIB survey in January 2019.Other irregularities include ""silence"" of the law enforcers and administrative officials; casting of fake votes; barring voters from going to polling stations; and forcing voters to cast votes for a specific symbol, the study said.Speaking at the meeting yesterday, Election Commissioner Brig Gen Ahsan Habib Khan (retired) also stressed the need for maintaining impartiality by the DCs and SPs.He said proceedings of the cases filed against political activists would continue. ""But all concerned should show a transparent attitude towards these matters. It should also be kept in mind that panic must not be created among the candidates or their supporters,"" Ahsan Habib added.According to EC officials, some DCs and SPs urged the commission not to use EVMs in remote areas. They said many voters are still wary of using EVM as they are not comfortable with using technology.The CEC said many officials have urged them to arrange massive campaigns and voter education on the use of EVM. ""We have plans to hold campaigns and educate voters on EVM.""Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Akter Hossain, senior secretary at the Public Security Division of the home ministry, said many officials suggested reducing the number of polling stations and increasing the number of booths instead so that enough law enforcers can be deployed to maintain law and order.He said officials would remain impartial while discharging election duties.Responding to a question, the senior secretary said the allegations of cases being filed to harass opposition activists during elections were not discussed. However, he said, there is no scope for filing such cases.An EC official said DCs and SPs proposed that there should be coordination between them and the local election officials regarding the selection of polling centres and presiding officers. They said smooth voting cannot be ensured unless the presiding officers remain impartial."
