/entertainment/tv-film/news/the-death-cartoon-network-3142696,The death of Cartoon Network? ,"Warner Bros' CEO, David Zaslav has been on a crusade to change what many of us loved about the company. From making Warner Bros Discovery less-diverse overall—by cutting a large number of employees—his latest plans to restructure the company seems likely to kill a channel most of us have grown up with, Cartoon Network. Even if Cartoon Network is not completely killed off, it is likely to become a shadow of what it originally used to be.These recent cuts, which come in the wake of Warner's merger with Discovery, eliminated a total of 43 open positions from its television division. In August, Warner Bros Discovery also cut around 70 positions at HBO Max, which also killed off the completed ""Batgirl"" movie and also resulted in dozens of other shows and movies being shelved.Now, people are concerned about the implications of the company's latest plans to merge Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios.According to an internal memo from Warner Bros Television CEO, Channing Dungey, Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe, Warner Bros Animation, and Cartoon Network Studios would continue to exist, under a 'new streamlined structure'.However, Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios will now have to share their development and production team. This decision probably  But the latter two animation labels will now share ""development and main production teams,"" which essentially means that Cartoon Network Studios will no longer have the creative control, as well as the choice to make decisions regarding operational matters.Zaslav's crusade to cut costs by cancelling the ""Batgirl"" movie—which has already completed filming—and shows like ""Raised by Wolves"", is seemingly continuing with the current situation surrounding Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios.However, as these two studios will now be working under one shared budget and a singular team, it seems unlikely that they will be able to operate in the same capacity they had previously. If this was not obvious already, earlier this month, Cartoon Network's ""Craig of the Creek"" and ""Jessica's Big Little World"" had their episode orders cut back by 50 percent. While both shows have not been cancelled as of yet, the way their budgets have been cut—despite the fact that they are some of Cartoon Network's most successful franchises—feels like a tell-tale situation for things to come. It seems likely that Warner Bros Discovery will keep the brand of Cartoon Network alive, simply due to the level of fanfare surrounding it. However, it feels like going forward, the Cartoon Network we all loved and grew up with will just be a shell of its former shelf. "

/business/economy/news/the-death-traditional-telecomsis-it-imminent-3142476,The death of traditional telecoms: Is it imminent?,"Don't panic! Telecoms are not going anywhere! But technology will certainly be hugely disrupted with the advent of high bandwidth and low-latency satellite internet.  Elon Musk has pioneered the disruption by launching Starlink, which puts traditional telecom companies under an imminent threat. Tower and fibre companies would, therefore, need to have their own survival strategy.Recently, one of the potential competitors of Starlink studied the Bangladesh market to figure out if it is feasible for them to provide low-cost high bandwidth and low-latency internet access from 2025. The same company has a plan to launch more than 12,000 low orbit satellites in the next few years. And they found it feasible to provide back-haul support to mobile network operators (MNOs).Let's understand the traditional telecom versus satellite infrastructure.The traditional infrastructure transmits and receives signals using land-based towers. Again, the towers are connected through fibre. Each tower covers its own boundary. The reason for problems like weak signals, call drops, low data speed etc, is the absence of towers in close proximity.On the other hand, satellite infrastructure is not dependent on terrestrial systems but utilises satellites orbiting the earth. This allows satellite signals to cover a much wider area.Imagine a future where an effective satellite will be deployed at a substantially lower cost than what it is today, and a 25GB 5G data plan being sold at $10 per month. The price may look to be a stretch but given the continued trend of rapid innovation and economic rationale, the capex (capital expenditure) cost per user per GB will be lower for satellite infrastructure as against the traditional telecom infrastructure.It must be borne in mind that a satellite can reach way more people than a tower, breaking various natural barriers.Is the traditional telecom infrastructure cheaper or less capex-hungry?If one considers the costs involved in building, updating and maintaining towers and fibres, active equipment investment, investment for rapid change in technology and high taxation, it makes it prohibitively expensive from both capex and opex (operating expense) perspective.However, there are debates over the number of satellites that can fit in LEO. Musk argues that tens of billions of satellites can coexist in LEO as against the current number of 4,500.Some 37 per cent of the world's population is not connected to internet. According to Iridum, a satellite communication company, only 15 per cent of the world's surface is covered by a traditional cellular network.In the case of Bangladesh, more than 60 per cent of the population is not connected to internet.For those living in rural or remote areas, advancement in satellite technology can complement existing terrestrial infrastructure in order to bring these individuals online and remove the digital divide.The government of Bangladesh and the private sector should explore the possibility of using LEO satellites to address the current accessibility issue of the rural and poor population as the best option available instead of relying on MNOs.The author is a telecom and management expert."

/opinion/views/blowin-the-wind/news/university-ranking-announcement-and-the-morning-after-3142761,University ranking announcement and the morning after,"The oldest private university in Bangladesh is giving its oldest public university a run for its money. They are the only two educational institutions to be featured in the top 800 of a world ranking estimated by Times Higher Education (THE). To see these local universities in the same global category provokes more questions than answers. These two universities – one in Dhaka North, the other in Dhaka South – are separated by thick traffic worth two-three hours on the road and a culture of mutual dismissiveness. Whether the ranking agency will thaw the frozen relationship is a matter to be seen. The achievement of North South University (NSU) cannot be brushed aside as it devised and pursued a strategic plan to achieve its status in the elite club of universities. Three other Bangladeshi universities, all technical in orientation – Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), and Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (Kuet) – have been featured in the 1200-1500 range. The overall performance is dismal. It begs the question: why are the other leading public universities and notable private universities not there?Established in 1921, Dhaka University (DU) has a clear advantage in the five areas in which THE measures the performance of a university: teaching, research, citations, international outlook, and industry income. With its government funding, DU caters to 38,172 students and has a fleet of 2,200 teachers. Conversely, NSU, established in 1992, has 20,596 students with a teaching team of 386 full-time and 362 part-time teachers. As per the UGC's 2019 record, DU spent Tk 52.02 crore in research and had 472 publications, while NSU spent Tk 65.32 crore in research and claimed 1,135 publications.It needs to be mentioned that a university needs to have 300 indexed publications a year for five consecutive years to be considered for THE ranking. NSU has persistently nurtured a research culture to be at par with a university that is 70 years older than it. The presence of three technical universities in the ranking suggests that they have the required number of publications, which many other universities lack.It is refreshing to see that DU is feeling the pressure to excel. Recently, it initiated an annual performance goal for each academic department and liberalised its international outlook. According to THE, 7.5 percent marks are given for international outlook based on the proportion of international students, international staff and international collaboration. This is an area in which private universities have greater flexibility. In terms of teaching, which makes up for 30 percent of the ranking scale, the subcategories are reputation survey, staff-to-student ratio, doctorate to bachelors ratio, doctorate awarded to academic staff, and institutional income.Given the government's policy of not allowing private universities to award doctorate degrees, private universities are missing out on the learning environment category. The same goes for industry income, amounting to 2.5 percent of THE ranking metrics, in which private universities are handicapped as they are not allowed to run for-profit institutes. But a lot depends on the reputation survey (15 percent in teaching and 18 percent in research), where the alumni in the job market contribute to the overall image of the participating university.NSU's success will inspire some other private universities to join the world ranking. They already have a clear strategic vision in place. The share of student distribution in the tertiary system, if we exclude the colleges under the National University, is almost equal. However, there persist some misconceptions about private universities as they are subjected to some additional regulatory monitoring that handicaps their growth.The introduction of private universities has stopped many students from going abroad as they could get quality education within the country and save money because of the credit-transfer scheme. In many cases, the curricula of public universities are not updated. Most of our programmes are not accredited. The government has initiated the Bangladesh Accreditation Council, which is likely to address the issue and bring the public and private universities under the same measurement scale. For the tertiary sector to grow, there has to be a common and consistent policy. Some older universities behave as if they are above any scrutiny. Their claim to vaunted prestige is now being rightfully challenged and claimed by newer universities. It is about time these divisions were eschewed as the teachers who teach and the students who learn are all citizens of this country. They all deserve fair and equal treatment. For instance, UGC research and travel grants are given only to public university teachers. UGC allows PhD programmes to be offered only by public universities.With the kind of intellectual resources that the leading private universities have, either through reverse brain drain by accommodating returning expatriate scholars or through retaining the best teachers who have retired from the public system, they can easily attract both local and international students in PhD programmes. Of course, UGC can apply strict regulatory criteria for awarding the degree. In absence of such open-mindedness, we are seeing many of our local students going abroad. Malaysia has become the second largest student destination for Bangladeshi students, which used to be a source country in the 1980s. According to the Bangladesh Bank, in the first four months of this year, USD 343.9 million were sent abroad to Bangladeshi students. Through the official channel, USD 1.32 billion (Tk 12,144 crore) was sent abroad for outbound student mobility. The actual figures would be higher as there is no record of the illegal channels. The number of outbound students has increased by 129 percent in the last six years. The success of DU and NSU shows that with the right attitude, we can create world-class universities to cater to our local needs and retain foreign currencies from being siphoned out. But to benefit from the system, we need a radical change in the mindset of the policymakers and the government. Dr Shamsad Mortuza is a professor of English at Dhaka University."

/opinion/views/news/persons-disabilities-are-integral-innovative-solutions-3141966,Persons with disabilities are integral to innovative solutions,"Ten years ago, the Asia-Pacific region came together and designed the world's first set of disability-specific development goals: the Incheon Strategy to ""Make the Right Real"" for Persons with Disabilities. We are going to meet again to assess how the governments have delivered on their commitments, to secure those gains and develop the innovative solutions needed to achieve fully inclusive societies. Ministers, government officials, persons with disabilities, civil society and private sector allies from Asia and the Pacific will gather on October 19-21 in Jakarta to mark the birth of a new era for 700 million persons with disabilities, and proclaim a fourth Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities.
Our region is unique, having already declared three decades to protect and uphold the rights of persons with disabilities. Forty-four Asian and Pacific governments have ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and we celebrate achievements in the development of disability laws, policies, strategies, and programmes.
Today, we have more parliamentarians and policymakers with disabilities. Their everyday business is national decision-making. They also monitor policy implementation. We find them active across the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Türkiye. They have promoted inclusive public procurement to support disability-inclusive businesses and accessible facilities, advanced sign language interpretation in media programmes and parliamentary sessions, focused policy attention on overlooked groups, and directed numerous policy initiatives towards inclusion.
Less visible but no less important are local-level elected politicians with disabilities in India, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Indonesia witnessed 42 candidates with disabilities standing in the last election. Grassroots disability organisations have emerged as rapid responders to emerging issues such as Covid-19 and other crises. Organisations of and for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh have distinguished themselves in disability-inclusive Covid-19 responses, and created programmes to support persons with psychosocial disabilities and autism.
The past decade saw the emergence of private sector leadership in disability-inclusive business. Wipro, headquartered in India, pioneers disability inclusion in its multinational growth strategy. This is a pillar of Wipro's diversity and inclusion initiatives. Employees with disabilities are at the core of designing and delivering Wipro digital services.
Yet, there is always more unfinished business to address. Even though we applaud the increasing participation of persons with disabilities in policymaking, there are still only eight persons with disabilities for every 1,000 parliamentarians in the region. On the right to work, three in four persons with disabilities are not employed, while seven in 10 persons with disabilities do not enjoy any form of social protection.
This sobering picture points to the need for disability-specific and disability-inclusive policies and their sustained implementation in partnership with women and men with disabilities.
One of the first steps to inclusion is recognising the rights of persons with disabilities. This model focuses on the person and their dignity, aspirations, individuality and value as a human being. As such, government offices, banks and public transportation and spaces must be made accessible for persons with diverse disabilities. To this end, governments in the region have conducted accessibility audits of government buildings and public transportation stations. Partnerships with the private sector have led to reasonable accommodations at work, promoting employment in a variety of sectors.
Despite the thrust of the Incheon Strategy on data collection and analysis, persons with disabilities still are often left out of official data, because the questions that allow for disaggregation are excluded from surveys, and accommodations are not made to ensure their participation. This reflects a continued lack of policy priority and budgetary allocations. To create evidence-based policies, we need reliable and comparable data disaggregated by disability status, sex and geographic location.
There is hope in the technology leap to 5G in the Asia-Pacific region. The implications for the empowerment of individuals are limitless: from digital access, e-healthcare and assistive devices at affordable prices to remote learning and working, and exercising the right to vote. This is a critical moment to ensure disability-inclusive digitalisation.
We live in a world of volatile change. A disability-inclusive approach to shape this world would benefit everyone, particularly in a rapidly ageing Asia-Pacific region where everyone's contributions will matter. As we stand on the precipice of a fourth Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities, it remains our duty to insist on a paradigm shift to celebrate diversity and disability inclusion. When we dismantle barriers and persons with disabilities surge ahead, everyone benefits.

The district's Tetulia upazila has recorded the lowest temperature at 19.7 degrees.Tetulia, the last border town in Bangladesh's north, is no stranger to extreme cold. But this year, amid autumn, a dense fog covered this upazila from dawn till 8am today (October 14, 2022).According to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), the minimum temperature was recorded at 19.7 degrees in Tetulia till 6am today (October 14, 2022).Due to dense fog, various vehicles were seen plying on the roads of the upazila with their headlights on.Locals said the weather had been warm during the daytime for the past few days.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/dui-diner-duniya-masterful-mix-logic-and-supernatural-mystique-3142776,‘Dui Diner Duniya’: A masterful mix of logic and supernatural mystique,"When an enigmatic figure—who claims to be from the future—crosses paths with a regular truck driver, where does the story go? Well, this is the plot of Chorki's newest release, ""Dui Diner Duniya"".Starring the stellar duo of Chanchal Chowdhury and Fazlur Rahman Babu, the mystery-thriller is where the past, the present, and the future collide, all at once, to show how life's simplest philosophy of retribution has the strangest ways of manifesting itself.One night, while trucking through the highway, Samad (Chanchal Chowdhury) spots a lone old man—later introduced as Jamshed (Fazlur Rahman Babu)—who is following him everywhere. Upon accepting Samad's offer for a free ride, Jamshed confesses that he has come here from the year 2033.He goes on to say that he is here to help Samad survive grave danger, which will inevitably take place soon. To Samad, all of this sounds like the tale of a madman, or the conspiracy of a fool. Samad continues to believe this narrative until a string of unfortunate events, caused in the wake of Samad's past misdeeds, start to surface. This is when we see Jamshed's life and true identity begin to gradually unravel themselves.Anam Biswas's direction and Ashraful Alam Shaon's storytelling was a highly anticipated collaboration, yet I was not ready for the sheer magnitude of their masterful layering of earthly logic and supernatural mystique.Although, by the end of the story, the core message becomes quite clear, the brilliance lies in the multifaceted possibilities of interpreting everything leading up to it.From the birds' eye shots of Samad's truck navigating the long stretch of the highway, eerily reminiscent of life's stubborn continuity despite the burdens of the past; to the role of Jamshed himself in the crescendo, seemingly a personification of one's own karma, it felt as if I might miss a subtle metaphor every time I dared to blink.The climax, in particular, hit home because of the clever do-or-die implications, a fine illustration of kismet's merciless revenge. Immediately followed by yet another mind-boggling turn, the ending manages to leave a trail of questions despite providing closure, leaving us with somewhat of a pleasant dilemma.When one takes attention away from the small details and looks at the bigger picture, it's astounding how ""Dui Diner Duniya"" utilises its female side-characters, as all of them— despite minimal screentime—play a massive part in the outline of the core plot.It might not seem noticeable at first, but Samad—whose vilest deeds include a woman as one of his victims—finds his daughter in the crux of his ultimate destiny, the key to which also lies in the hand of another woman, equal retribution once again. My personal favourite female character in this case was Moushumi Hamid as Lata, who doesn't get to say much, and yet leaves a mark.Chanchal Chowdhury and Fazlur Rahman Babu fit into their roles as neatly as puzzle pieces falling in place, maintaining perfectly convincing character, while delivering performances without overshadowing one another throughout the entire duration. As a whole, ""Dui Diner Duniya"" is a story viewers might need some time to process, but it will be one that stays with you."
/news/world/uk/news/uk-pm-truss-fires-kwasi-kwarteng-says-bbc-3142741,"UK PM Truss fires Kwasi Kwarteng, says BBC","British Prime Minister Liz Truss has fired her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, the BBC reported on Friday, shortly before she is expected to scrap parts of his economic package in a bid to survive the market and political turmoil gripping the country.Downing Street confirmed that Truss, in power for only 37 days, would hold a press conference later on Friday after Kwarteng was forced to rush back to London from IMF meetings in Washington to address the chaos.The BBC said Kwarteng had been sacked. Downing Street declined to comment.If that is confirmed, Kwarteng would become Britain's shortest serving chancellor since 1970, and his successor would be the country's fourth finance minister in as many months.British government bonds rallied further on Friday, adding to their partial recovery since Truss's government started looking for ways to balance the books after her unfunded tax cuts crushed UK asset values and drew international censure.Kwarteng had announced a new fiscal policy on Sept. 23, delivering Truss's vision for vast tax cuts and deregulation to try to shock the economy out of years of stagnant growth.But the response from markets was so ferocious that the Bank of England had to intervene to prevent pension funds from being caught up in the chaos, as borrowing and mortgage costs surged.The duo have since been under mounting pressure to reverse course, as polls showed support for their Conservative Party had collapsed, prompting colleagues to openly discuss whether they should be replaced.Having triggered a market rout, Truss now runs the risk of bringing the government down if she cannot find a package of public spending cuts and tax rises that can appease investors and get through any parliamentary vote in the House of Commons.Her search for savings will be made harder by the fact the government has been cutting departmental budgets for years.At the same time the Conservative Party's discipline has all but broken down, fractured by infighting as it struggled first to agree a way to leave the European Union and then how to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and grow the economy.""If you can't get your budget through parliament you can't govern,"" Chris Bryant, a senior lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter. ""This isn't about u-turns, it's about proper governance.""Downing Street has so far declined to comment but Kwarteng had not been expected to appear at Truss's news conference later on Friday, fuelling speculation about his future.During his time in the United States Kwarteng had been told by the head of the International Monetary Fund of the importance of ""policy coherence"", underlining how far Britain's reputation for sound economic management and institutional stability had fallen.Shortly before 11 a.m. (10:00 GMT) Britain's television news channels switched to carry live footage of a British Airways plane landing at Heathrow, carrying Kwarteng.In Westminster, Truss was trying to find agreement with her cabinet ministers on a way to preserve her push for growth while also reassuring the markets and working out which of the measures could be supported by her lawmakers in parliament.Earlier a minister in the trade department, Greg Hands, had said people wanting details on the budget would have to wait until Oct. 31 when Kwarteng was due to set out his full plan alongside independent forecasts that will show the cost of the tax cuts to the public finances and whether they will boost economic growth.Critics of the government had said that wait was unacceptable.Rupert Harrison, a portfolio manager at Blackrock and once an adviser to former British finance minister George Osborne, said markets have now almost fully priced in a U-turn.""(That) means if the U-turn doesn't come markets will react badly,"" he said on Twitter.INTERNATIONAL CREDIBILITYA Conservative Party lawmaker, who asked not to be named, said Truss's economic policy had caused so much damage that investors may demand even deeper cuts to public spending as the price for their support.""Everything's possible at the moment,"" said the lawmaker, who backed Sunak in the leadership race. ""Problem is the markets have lost trust in the Conservative Party - and who can blame them?""Another lawmaker told Reuters earlier this week that Truss needed to appreciate that there was not a huge amount of enthusiasm for her at the moment.According to a source close to the prime minister, Truss is now in ""listening mode"" and inviting lawmakers to speak to her team about their concerns to gauge which parts of the programme they would support in parliament.Credit Suisse economist Sonali Punhani said markets needed to see a credible fiscal plan, with the government needing to find around 60 billion pounds through tax cut U-turns and further spending cuts.""It would be challenging to deliver the scale of these cuts, but for them to be credible, these need to be delivered sooner rather than in the latter part of the forecast,"" Punhani said.One policy that is expected to be reversed is their plan to hold corporation tax rates at 19%. That had formed a key part of their package after Sunak proposed increasing it to 25% when he was finance minister under Truss's predecessor Boris Johnson."
