/sports/sports-special/t20-world-cup-2022/news/combative-afghanistan-must-defy-odds-3142821, Combative Afghanistan must defy odds ,"Afghanistan are looking to their wily spinners and aggressive batsmen to rise to a stiff challenge in the Super 12 stage of the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.Mohammad Nabi's team are placed in a tough group alongside hosts and title-holders Australia, former champions England, New Zealand and two qualifiers. Only two of those six will make it into the semi-finals.If that was not enough, off the field Afghanistan's cricket board is facing a financial crisis because funds from the International Cricket Council are not reaching the country due to sanctions on the Taliban government.The Afghans were touted as dark-horses at the recent Asia Cup, but in the Super Four stage they lost to eventual champions Sri Lanka and also Pakistan and India.Skipper Nabi nevertheless took some positives.""As a unit, as a team, we showed in the Asia Cup that Afghanistan has quality batsmen, bowlers and fielders,"" Nabi said at the time.""We are known to defend totals, not chase totals. Our team looks properly balanced.""Afghanistan's biggest strength is their globe-trotting spin quartet of Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Qais Ahmad.They have featured in various Twenty20 leagues around the world and have ample experience of Australian pitches while playing in the Big Bash League. They know how to stop runs and take wickets in Australia.Former New Zealand coach Mike Hesson fears Afghanistan's spinners could cause havoc against the 2021 beaten finalists.""I'm a little bit wary of New Zealand playing Afghanistan at Melbourne,"" said Hesson.""Because the Melbourne pitch does take turn and the Afghanistan spinners are as good as there are throughout the world. That's going to be a tough game for the Black Caps.""Besides the spin attack, Afghanistan now also have quality left-arm pacers in Fazalhaq Farooqi and Fareed Ahmad.True to their aggressive nature, Afghanistan's batting is full of hard hitters.The opening duo of Hazratullah Zazai and Rahmanullah Gurbaz can hit over the top at will. The middle order is packed with Najibullah Zadran, all-rounder Nabi, Ibrahim Zadran and newcomer Darwish Rasooli.Recently joined head coach Jonathan Trott, the former England batsman, has brought a degree of sanity to the cavalier batting style by directing one batter to hold one end while others hit around him.

/news/world/uk/news/uk-pm-truss-fires-kwasi-kwarteng-says-bbc-3142741,"UK PM Truss fires Kwasi Kwarteng, says BBC","British Prime Minister Liz Truss has fired her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, the BBC reported on Friday, shortly before she is expected to scrap parts of his economic package in a bid to survive the market and political turmoil gripping the country.Downing Street confirmed that Truss, in power for only 37 days, would hold a press conference later on Friday after Kwarteng was forced to rush back to London from IMF meetings in Washington to address the chaos.The BBC said Kwarteng had been sacked. Downing Street declined to comment.If that is confirmed, Kwarteng would become Britain's shortest serving chancellor since 1970, and his successor would be the country's fourth finance minister in as many months.British government bonds rallied further on Friday, adding to their partial recovery since Truss's government started looking for ways to balance the books after her unfunded tax cuts crushed UK asset values and drew international censure.Kwarteng had announced a new fiscal policy on Sept. 23, delivering Truss's vision for vast tax cuts and deregulation to try to shock the economy out of years of stagnant growth.But the response from markets was so ferocious that the Bank of England had to intervene to prevent pension funds from being caught up in the chaos, as borrowing and mortgage costs surged.The duo have since been under mounting pressure to reverse course, as polls showed support for their Conservative Party had collapsed, prompting colleagues to openly discuss whether they should be replaced.Having triggered a market rout, Truss now runs the risk of bringing the government down if she cannot find a package of public spending cuts and tax rises that can appease investors and get through any parliamentary vote in the House of Commons.Her search for savings will be made harder by the fact the government has been cutting departmental budgets for years.At the same time the Conservative Party's discipline has all but broken down, fractured by infighting as it struggled first to agree a way to leave the European Union and then how to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and grow the economy.""If you can't get your budget through parliament you can't govern,"" Chris Bryant, a senior lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter. ""This isn't about u-turns, it's about proper governance.""Downing Street has so far declined to comment but Kwarteng had not been expected to appear at Truss's news conference later on Friday, fuelling speculation about his future.During his time in the United States Kwarteng had been told by the head of the International Monetary Fund of the importance of ""policy coherence"", underlining how far Britain's reputation for sound economic management and institutional stability had fallen.Shortly before 11 a.m. (10:00 GMT) Britain's television news channels switched to carry live footage of a British Airways plane landing at Heathrow, carrying Kwarteng.In Westminster, Truss was trying to find agreement with her cabinet ministers on a way to preserve her push for growth while also reassuring the markets and working out which of the measures could be supported by her lawmakers in parliament.Earlier a minister in the trade department, Greg Hands, had said people wanting details on the budget would have to wait until Oct. 31 when Kwarteng was due to set out his full plan alongside independent forecasts that will show the cost of the tax cuts to the public finances and whether they will boost economic growth.Critics of the government had said that wait was unacceptable.Rupert Harrison, a portfolio manager at Blackrock and once an adviser to former British finance minister George Osborne, said markets have now almost fully priced in a U-turn.""(That) means if the U-turn doesn't come markets will react badly,"" he said on Twitter.INTERNATIONAL CREDIBILITYA Conservative Party lawmaker, who asked not to be named, said Truss's economic policy had caused so much damage that investors may demand even deeper cuts to public spending as the price for their support.""Everything's possible at the moment,"" said the lawmaker, who backed Sunak in the leadership race. ""Problem is the markets have lost trust in the Conservative Party - and who can blame them?""Another lawmaker told Reuters earlier this week that Truss needed to appreciate that there was not a huge amount of enthusiasm for her at the moment.According to a source close to the prime minister, Truss is now in ""listening mode"" and inviting lawmakers to speak to her team about their concerns to gauge which parts of the programme they would support in parliament.Credit Suisse economist Sonali Punhani said markets needed to see a credible fiscal plan, with the government needing to find around 60 billion pounds through tax cut U-turns and further spending cuts.""It would be challenging to deliver the scale of these cuts, but for them to be credible, these need to be delivered sooner rather than in the latter part of the forecast,"" Punhani said.One policy that is expected to be reversed is their plan to hold corporation tax rates at 19%. That had formed a key part of their package after Sunak proposed increasing it to 25% when he was finance minister under Truss's predecessor Boris Johnson."
/sports/sports-special/t20-world-cup-2022/news/namibia-living-the-dream-after-2021-t20-wc-breakthrough-3142871, Namibia living the dream after 2021 T20 WC breakthrough,"Namibia were the surprise package on their T20 World Cup debut a year ago, reaching the Super 12 stage, and are looking to build on that momentum in Australia and cause a few upsets.In the UAE 12 months ago they beat Ireland, the Netherlands and Scotland.They start this year's campaign against Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka On Sunday before renewing hostilities with the Dutch and completing the preliminary round against the UAE""It's like living a dream for these players,"" said coach Pierre De Bruyn. ""None of them have played in Australia before.""Again led by captain Gerhard Erasmus, the experienced squad has a familiar look to it and Namibia will be hoping for more big performances from talisman David Wiese and paceman Ruben Trumpelmann, key performers 12 months ago.""Last year we walked into the unknown,"" said De Bruyn.""What we've gained is World Cup experience and confidence. But we also know there are no guarantees. We have to win two games.""Divan la Cock, dubbed ""an exciting talent"" by De Bruyn, is likely to open the batting in place of the retired Craig Williams but apart from that the Eagles will be relying on the core of the 2021 team.Veteran Wiese and JJ Smit are hard-hitting batsmen and Namibia have an unusual bowling attack, dominated by left-arm seamers.They are mentored by bowling coach Albie Morkel who has been able to call on help from his brother, the former South Africa Test fast bowler Morne Morkel.""Morne lives in Australia now and he's bowled many overs here. He brings calmness and some good ideas,"" said De Bruyn.Albie Morkel joined up with the Eagles when they defeated Zimbabwe 3-2 in a five-match T20 series in May. Namibia have only played three other T20 internationals this year.But a link-up with Pakistan T20 Super League champions Lahore Qalandars has seen four Namibian players train at the Qalandars academy while a Twenty20 tri-series, including South Africa's Lions, formed part of their World Cup preparations.""We would like to have played more internationals but we have played quite a lot of T20 cricket (in the tri-series) against teams like the Lions and Lahore Qalandars,"" said De Bruyn.Namibia's Super 12 highlight in the UAE a year ago came against Scotland, when Trumpelmann became the first bowler to take three wickets in the first over of an T20 international to set up a four-wicket win.They found life tougher in their other five matches but gained valuable experience.Reaching the Super 12 was enough to secure their berth in Australia this year.

/shout/news/everything-you-need-know-watching-one-piece-film-red-3142826,Everything you need to know before watching One Piece Film: Red,"Over the past 25 years, One Piece has accumulated a large and illustrious catalogue of non-canon and spin-off movies. As it currently stands, there are a total of 15 feature films in the franchise, each having varying degrees of importance to the main story. And the latest addition to the franchise, One Piece Film: Red, hit Bangladeshi theatres on October 14.Released in Japan in August 2022, One Piece Film: Red follows the Straw Hat Pirates as they venture into the world's grandest concert. At the helm of the festivities will be Princess Uta, who is apparently the daughter of Red-haired Shanks, one of the most mysterious characters in the series.While the announcement of the film's release in Bangladesh garnered widespread popularity, most fans still have their own reservations about the upcoming film. Owing to the sheer volume of inconsequential and lacklustre One Piece movies in the past, a large number of people are worried about the events surrounding the movie and what they can expect out of it.Firstly, to address the elephant in the room, One Piece Film: Red isn't canon. To be more specific, the events that transpire in the movie are wholly independent of the continuity of the main story. However, the film will likely explore elements and shed light on information relevant to the current plot.According to One Piece author Eiichiro Oda, Film: Red will reveal canonical information about Shanks, despite his character getting little to no development in the actual series. The film is supposed to shed light on his past, which will directly connect to the manga's ongoing story. Furthermore, the film's trailers suggested a childhood friendship between the primary protagonist, Luffy and Uta, which might prove to be important to the main storyline moving forward.Another important matter that must be touched upon is the extent of prior knowledge that is required to properly enjoy the movie. Unfortunately, this is where things start to get trickier. Film: Red's cast of characters includes both protagonist and antagonist forces from some of the most recent arcs like the Whole Cake Island arc. Moreover, there are also certain abilities and revelations in the film that haven't even been adapted into the anime yet. As such, the film will definitely navigate through spoiler territory for those who aren't fully caught up to the source material yet.And unlike other films like Jujutsu Kaisen 0, which could be viewed without prior knowledge regarding their respective franchises, One Piece Film: Red does require some amount of knowledge regarding the vast world of fictional pirates. As a result, casual fans who haven't watched One Piece before may not be able to fully indulge in everything the film has to offer.Regardless, the film has earned over 15 billion yen locally, making it one of Japan's highest-grossing films ever. Fans and critics alike have praised the show for its lush animation, an abundance of soundtracks, and top-tier fight scenes, making it a must-watch for One Piece fans.Reference:Sportskeeda (July 18, 2022). Oda confirms One Piece Film: Red will uncover Shanks' secret that has a canon connection.Ayaan spends most of his time formatting spreadsheets.

/business/economy/news/the-death-traditional-telecomsis-it-imminent-3142476,The death of traditional telecoms: Is it imminent?,"Don't panic! Telecoms are not going anywhere! But technology will certainly be hugely disrupted with the advent of high bandwidth and low-latency satellite internet.  Elon Musk has pioneered the disruption by launching Starlink, which puts traditional telecom companies under an imminent threat. Tower and fibre companies would, therefore, need to have their own survival strategy.Recently, one of the potential competitors of Starlink studied the Bangladesh market to figure out if it is feasible for them to provide low-cost high bandwidth and low-latency internet access from 2025. The same company has a plan to launch more than 12,000 low orbit satellites in the next few years. And they found it feasible to provide back-haul support to mobile network operators (MNOs).Let's understand the traditional telecom versus satellite infrastructure.The traditional infrastructure transmits and receives signals using land-based towers. Again, the towers are connected through fibre. Each tower covers its own boundary. The reason for problems like weak signals, call drops, low data speed etc, is the absence of towers in close proximity.On the other hand, satellite infrastructure is not dependent on terrestrial systems but utilises satellites orbiting the earth. This allows satellite signals to cover a much wider area.Imagine a future where an effective satellite will be deployed at a substantially lower cost than what it is today, and a 25GB 5G data plan being sold at $10 per month. The price may look to be a stretch but given the continued trend of rapid innovation and economic rationale, the capex (capital expenditure) cost per user per GB will be lower for satellite infrastructure as against the traditional telecom infrastructure.It must be borne in mind that a satellite can reach way more people than a tower, breaking various natural barriers.Is the traditional telecom infrastructure cheaper or less capex-hungry?If one considers the costs involved in building, updating and maintaining towers and fibres, active equipment investment, investment for rapid change in technology and high taxation, it makes it prohibitively expensive from both capex and opex (operating expense) perspective.However, there are debates over the number of satellites that can fit in LEO. Musk argues that tens of billions of satellites can coexist in LEO as against the current number of 4,500.Some 37 per cent of the world's population is not connected to internet. According to Iridum, a satellite communication company, only 15 per cent of the world's surface is covered by a traditional cellular network.In the case of Bangladesh, more than 60 per cent of the population is not connected to internet.For those living in rural or remote areas, advancement in satellite technology can complement existing terrestrial infrastructure in order to bring these individuals online and remove the digital divide.The government of Bangladesh and the private sector should explore the possibility of using LEO satellites to address the current accessibility issue of the rural and poor population as the best option available instead of relying on MNOs.The author is a telecom and management expert."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/the-death-cartoon-network-3142696,The death of Cartoon Network? ,"Warner Bros' CEO, David Zaslav has been on a crusade to change what many of us loved about the company. From making Warner Bros Discovery less-diverse overall—by cutting a large number of employees—his latest plans to restructure the company seems likely to kill a channel most of us have grown up with, Cartoon Network. Even if Cartoon Network is not completely killed off, it is likely to become a shadow of what it originally used to be.These recent cuts, which come in the wake of Warner's merger with Discovery, eliminated a total of 43 open positions from its television division. In August, Warner Bros Discovery also cut around 70 positions at HBO Max, which also killed off the completed ""Batgirl"" movie and also resulted in dozens of other shows and movies being shelved.Now, people are concerned about the implications of the company's latest plans to merge Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios.According to an internal memo from Warner Bros Television CEO, Channing Dungey, Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe, Warner Bros Animation, and Cartoon Network Studios would continue to exist, under a 'new streamlined structure'.However, Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios will now have to share their development and production team. This decision probably  But the latter two animation labels will now share ""development and main production teams,"" which essentially means that Cartoon Network Studios will no longer have the creative control, as well as the choice to make decisions regarding operational matters.Zaslav's crusade to cut costs by cancelling the ""Batgirl"" movie—which has already completed filming—and shows like ""Raised by Wolves"", is seemingly continuing with the current situation surrounding Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios.However, as these two studios will now be working under one shared budget and a singular team, it seems unlikely that they will be able to operate in the same capacity they had previously. If this was not obvious already, earlier this month, Cartoon Network's ""Craig of the Creek"" and ""Jessica's Big Little World"" had their episode orders cut back by 50 percent. While both shows have not been cancelled as of yet, the way their budgets have been cut—despite the fact that they are some of Cartoon Network's most successful franchises—feels like a tell-tale situation for things to come. It seems likely that Warner Bros Discovery will keep the brand of Cartoon Network alive, simply due to the level of fanfare surrounding it. However, it feels like going forward, the Cartoon Network we all loved and grew up with will just be a shell of its former shelf. "

/shout/news/the-epic-battle-between-my-appetite-and-food-videos-3142896,The epic battle between my appetite and food videos,"I believe my habit of watching food videos developed out of my desperate attempt to include leisure time in my very hectic schedule. Food videos are short enough for me to finish watching them, but also uninteresting enough for me to stop watching as required. The only problem being, they leave me hungry. Often at inconvenient times.That being said, as of 2:15 AM right now, I have decided to log how long I can watch only food videos, without ordering/cooking any food outside my regular diet. To make things embarrassing, when I say log, I mean write an article about my pathetic attempt. Day 1– I am more than my appetiteWhile watching these videos, I initially focus on other aspects of the videos. For example, how clean the kitchen in the video is, to distract myself from the actual food. I even went as far as to be inspired to clean my own room in the middle of the night. My mother was very pleased by how clean my room was in the morning. She even made me fried chicken when I got home from work that day as a thank you. Did the chicken help appease my innate need for ordering food? Not really. Did I try imagining the chicken to be the food I was craving? None of your business.Day 2 – Going through my financesMiraculously, despite the food videos being similar, I was still not bored. Instead, my appetite increased. So, being the responsible adult that I am, I decided to prove to myself that I was already over-budget this month, and therefore could not order food. Going through my finances, I realised I have fifteen taka to my name. Because now this would mean I must go scour the internet to see if I can buy anything for fifteen taka.Day 3 – Forgetting about the videos entirelyMy quest to find food worth ten taka has almost taken up half my day (I decided to save five taka for later). Having accepted defeat, I had finally given up and bought one packet of chips from the nearest shop. I then suddenly remembered what the main purpose of this quest was, and went straight back to food videos on Youtube.Day 4 – Attempting to cookWho needs to order food when you can instead just make it yourself? After going through thousands of Youtube videos, getting all my cooking utensils and ingredients ready, I then proceeded to go request my sister to cook for me, because all I wanted was easy food without any effort having to be put in on my end, only to be rejected. Why must things be so complicated?Day 5 – Convincing myself I don't need itDifferent cuisines fit different palettes. What if the food I'm seeing is not compatible with my palettes? I would be wasting my hard-earned money. It would be much wiser to instead stick to the flavours I am familiar with, and, who am I kidding?Day 6 – OrderingI have zero regrets. One hundred percent worth it. But I am never repeating it again because I am once again over budget in terms of spending, and I now owe money to a loan shark. Maybe I should adopt a life of crime. That is the sort of profession that could actually fund this lifestyle.Bushra Zaman likes books, art, and only being contacted by email. Contact her at bushrazaman31@yahoo.com"

Now, that things are a bit better, I have made it public once again with a new collection for summer, fall and winter,"" said the whiz designer.The main idea behind starting the fashion store was to encourage the deshi's to visit a proper 'designer-based' lifestyle store, where they could find all sorts of fashion wear and also lifestyle-related items like cushion covers, creative sofas, scented candles etc.""Bangladeshi's mostly have an inclination to go abroad for anything that is 'designer based' and that's purely a shame, especially when there are so many talented designers in our country and that is the prime idea behind starting bluebutton.lifestyle, which has also been a dream project for me, for the longest time,"" reflected Zaheen.But why the name Blue Button…?To this, Zaheen only seemed more enthusiastic to respond, ""Because it's a sea creature and I have been fond of aquatic animals since my childhood, as I was born in Cox's Bazar.The authenticity of the costume designs in 'Hawa,' certainly proves to us, how talented Zaheen is and bluebutton.lifestyle will hopefully prove to us again, that her ingenuity is boundless. "

/opinion/views/news/ask-your-party-commit-rti-3142746,Ask your party to commit to RTI,"Bangladesh is in the throes of election fever, even though the next general elections are more than a year away. There is fear that the situation may become more tense and heated than the previous two elections. One way to cool down and professionalise the atmosphere would be to make the elections more issue-based. They should be contests in which political parties explain their respective positions on critical national issues to the voting public. One such issue is governance and the commitment of those seeking to govern the country. Two laws form the basis for citizens to affect governance. First, the election laws which allow citizens once every five years to elect people to power, whom they trust to ensure better governance. Secondly, the Right to Information (RTI) Act, which empowers citizens to monitor the work of all public offices entrusted with day-to-day governance and ensure that they do so lawfully. We believe both are equally important. The RTI law complements election laws by providing a more permanent basis for citizens to intervene with the government on matters of governance. The forthcoming elections provide an opportunity to emphasise this aspect of RTI. To begin with, RTI enthusiasts and citizen groups should demand that political parties declare their position on the subject. The goal should be to engage the political parties in discussions regarding the revolutionary objectives of the law and the role they must play – should they form the next government. Are they committed to help the law reach its full potential without any hindrance? Will they ensure that public officials will respect the law and not restrict its application or abuse its provisions to frustrate its objectives?The elections provide us an opportunity to look back over the years since the RTI Act was enacted in 2009, identify issues that slow progress and the measures required to correct them. This is a young law: 13 years is not a very long time for a law of such a nature to strike deep roots anywhere in the world. This law's objectives go against the grain of traditional governance practices employed globally. But societies must move towards openness; unless we pay attention to the challenges and learn to overcome them, progress will prove elusive. Among all laws of the land, RTI is uniquely a people's law and only people can make it work. Governments have little or no incentive to do so since the ideal of the law is to bring them under people's control. There is a need to continually educate the public about the objectives of the law and help them articulate their demands to the political parties to commit themselves to its implementation. The prevailing culture of governance in most countries is to foster secrecy as opposed to transparency. The general assumption is that ordinary citizens not only have no business in the affairs of the state, but those wanting to enquire into them must have illegitimate motives. In fact, this has been the experience of many in Bangladesh, leading them to abandon their RTI pursuits. Political parties must be asked to clearly state their positions to the public in this regard. When Bangladesh adopted the law, the topic was not fully debated. The elections offer an opportunity to air out these concerns and objectives in public discourse. As in many other countries, the RTI experience in Bangladesh has revealed many procedural difficulties citizens face to obtain information from public authorities. Many public officials use the law and its procedures to avoid responsibilities and to discourage and deny information requests from citizens. They fail to recognise that the law encourages citizens to seek information from public offices not for personal needs only, but also to advance public good. Let's ask those seeking to form the next government to do their best to remove all impediments to the application of the RTI law and encourage public officials to respect its objectives. This should include keeping to the timelines foreseen in the law and not denying information requests without explanation.Those standing for elections should also tell us whether they would be ready to provide the necessary support to the Information Commission, which is entrusted with the job of steering the law and resolving disputes between seekers and providers of information. Of particular importance would be to increase their capacity not only to take proper decisions, but also to articulate them judiciously to help the development of proper jurisprudence on the subject. Let's ask those we are voting for if they will commit to following the selection process for commissioners, and ensure that they have legal expertise and act with objectivity and neutrality. Let's also remind election candidates that successfully implementing RTI is an essential element of Goal 16 of the SDGs, to which Bangladesh has committed itself fully. So far, there is little to show that we are doing well in that regard. Finally, political parties must bear in mind that their commitment to better governance and a more effective RTI regime in the country would depend a great deal upon their ability to ensure rule of law, accountability, civil liberties, and political rights for the citizens. Let the next general elections focus more on these issues and help the nation tread the democratic path more confidently.Dr Shamsul Bari and Ruhi Naz are chairman and assistant director (RTI), respectively, at Research Initiatives, Bangladesh (RIB)."
/opinion/views/blowin-the-wind/news/university-ranking-announcement-and-the-morning-after-3142761,University ranking announcement and the morning after,"The oldest private university in Bangladesh is giving its oldest public university a run for its money. They are the only two educational institutions to be featured in the top 800 of a world ranking estimated by Times Higher Education (THE). To see these local universities in the same global category provokes more questions than answers. These two universities – one in Dhaka North, the other in Dhaka South – are separated by thick traffic worth two-three hours on the road and a culture of mutual dismissiveness. Whether the ranking agency will thaw the frozen relationship is a matter to be seen. The achievement of North South University (NSU) cannot be brushed aside as it devised and pursued a strategic plan to achieve its status in the elite club of universities. Three other Bangladeshi universities, all technical in orientation – Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), and Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (Kuet) – have been featured in the 1200-1500 range. The overall performance is dismal. It begs the question: why are the other leading public universities and notable private universities not there?Established in 1921, Dhaka University (DU) has a clear advantage in the five areas in which THE measures the performance of a university: teaching, research, citations, international outlook, and industry income. With its government funding, DU caters to 38,172 students and has a fleet of 2,200 teachers. Conversely, NSU, established in 1992, has 20,596 students with a teaching team of 386 full-time and 362 part-time teachers. As per the UGC's 2019 record, DU spent Tk 52.02 crore in research and had 472 publications, while NSU spent Tk 65.32 crore in research and claimed 1,135 publications.It needs to be mentioned that a university needs to have 300 indexed publications a year for five consecutive years to be considered for THE ranking. NSU has persistently nurtured a research culture to be at par with a university that is 70 years older than it. The presence of three technical universities in the ranking suggests that they have the required number of publications, which many other universities lack.It is refreshing to see that DU is feeling the pressure to excel. Recently, it initiated an annual performance goal for each academic department and liberalised its international outlook. According to THE, 7.5 percent marks are given for international outlook based on the proportion of international students, international staff and international collaboration. This is an area in which private universities have greater flexibility. In terms of teaching, which makes up for 30 percent of the ranking scale, the subcategories are reputation survey, staff-to-student ratio, doctorate to bachelors ratio, doctorate awarded to academic staff, and institutional income.Given the government's policy of not allowing private universities to award doctorate degrees, private universities are missing out on the learning environment category. The same goes for industry income, amounting to 2.5 percent of THE ranking metrics, in which private universities are handicapped as they are not allowed to run for-profit institutes. But a lot depends on the reputation survey (15 percent in teaching and 18 percent in research), where the alumni in the job market contribute to the overall image of the participating university.NSU's success will inspire some other private universities to join the world ranking. They already have a clear strategic vision in place. The share of student distribution in the tertiary system, if we exclude the colleges under the National University, is almost equal. However, there persist some misconceptions about private universities as they are subjected to some additional regulatory monitoring that handicaps their growth.The introduction of private universities has stopped many students from going abroad as they could get quality education within the country and save money because of the credit-transfer scheme. In many cases, the curricula of public universities are not updated. Most of our programmes are not accredited. The government has initiated the Bangladesh Accreditation Council, which is likely to address the issue and bring the public and private universities under the same measurement scale. For the tertiary sector to grow, there has to be a common and consistent policy. Some older universities behave as if they are above any scrutiny. Their claim to vaunted prestige is now being rightfully challenged and claimed by newer universities. It is about time these divisions were eschewed as the teachers who teach and the students who learn are all citizens of this country. They all deserve fair and equal treatment. For instance, UGC research and travel grants are given only to public university teachers. UGC allows PhD programmes to be offered only by public universities.With the kind of intellectual resources that the leading private universities have, either through reverse brain drain by accommodating returning expatriate scholars or through retaining the best teachers who have retired from the public system, they can easily attract both local and international students in PhD programmes. Of course, UGC can apply strict regulatory criteria for awarding the degree. In absence of such open-mindedness, we are seeing many of our local students going abroad. Malaysia has become the second largest student destination for Bangladeshi students, which used to be a source country in the 1980s. According to the Bangladesh Bank, in the first four months of this year, USD 343.9 million were sent abroad to Bangladeshi students. Through the official channel, USD 1.32 billion (Tk 12,144 crore) was sent abroad for outbound student mobility. The actual figures would be higher as there is no record of the illegal channels. The number of outbound students has increased by 129 percent in the last six years. The success of DU and NSU shows that with the right attitude, we can create world-class universities to cater to our local needs and retain foreign currencies from being siphoned out. But to benefit from the system, we need a radical change in the mindset of the policymakers and the government. Dr Shamsad Mortuza is a professor of English at Dhaka University."

/sports/football/news/psg-troubled-mbappe-future-the-air-again-3142811,PSG troubled as Mbappe future up in the air again,"Less than five months after Kylian Mbappe signed a new three-year contract to supposedly end the uncertainty about his future, Paris Saint-Germain are once again facing up to the possibility of losing the France superstar.The Qatar-owned club sit top of Ligue 1 and their Champions League group, but all is not well in the French capital with a raft of reasons given for Mbappe reportedly wanting away.It has completely overshadowed PSG's build-up to Sunday's game against bitter rivals Marseille.The speculation started on Tuesday, hours before Christophe Galtier's team hosted Benfica in the Champions League, with Spanish sports daily Marca and several French media reporting that Mbappe wants to leave as early as the January transfer window.Mbappe has in recent weeks let it be known publicly that he is unhappy with the position he has been asked to play in new coach Galtier's system, pointing out after playing for France last month that he has ""much more freedom"" playing for his country.Mbappe still scored his 12th goal of the season for PSG as they drew 1-1 with Benfica, but it is believed he is disappointed the club did not sign a top-class centre-forward in the close season –- for example Robert Lewandowski, who went to Barcelona.PSG's football advisor Luis Campos told Canal Plus that Mbappe had ""never spoken to me about leaving in January"".However, that was before the investigative website Mediapart reported on Wednesday that an agency called Digital Big Brother (DBB) had worked on behalf of PSG to deploy a series of Twitter accounts with the task of boosting the club's image.The work involved going after a number of targets earmarked by the club, including a supporter slapped by Neymar after PSG lost the 2019 French Cup final and a woman who accused the Brazilian of raping her.But there were also internal targets, such as Adrien Rabiot –- now with Juventus –- and Mbappe himself.""We worked for PSG. It bothers us for our reputation that PSG deny working with us,"" Frederic Geldhof, who worked for a subsidiary of DBB called UReputation, told AFP.PSG have ""firmly"" denied the allegations that they asked the agency to work on their behalf.""We were doing everything to get him to extend his contract. We were not going to secretly troll him,"" one source, formerly connected to the PSG board, told AFP of the claims Mbappe was targeted.The affair carries similarities to the 'Barcagate' scandal which saw Barcelona allegedly hire a company to smear opponents of the club's board on social media.It may do little to help the relationship between PSG and their biggest star, even if there is surely little prospect of the club agreeing to sell Mbappe in the January transfer window.One to watch: Laurent Blanc
Over six years after he last coached in Europe, Blanc is back on a Ligue 1 bench this weekend as he takes charge of Lyon for the first time against Rennes. The 56-year-old replaces the sacked Peter Bosz.He arrives with Lyon languishing in ninth place in the table, already nine points adrift of the Champions League places. Blanc coached PSG from 2013 to 2016, winning three straight Ligue 1 titles. His only coaching job since then came at Al Rayyan in Qatar, where he spent a year before departing in February."
