If these two can be coordinated, the momentum of the development accelerates.""He was speaking at a seminar titled ""Aspirational Momentum: The Development Story of Bangladesh"", organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) at the Lakeshore Hotel in Dhaka.Infant mortality has reduced in Bangladesh faster than other countries, he said.The use of oral saline for diarrhoea, use of vaccines, reduction of women fertility rates due to their involvement in job sectors played a vital role in reducing infant mortality, he added.He said there has been a big shift in investing in children now rather than the number of children.People are now more cautious about the quality of education and healthcare children are getting, not about the number of children. "

/supplements/bangladesh-cable-industry-outlook/news/walk-the-talk-3144016,Walk the talk,"Engineer Abu Noman Howlader Chairman, BBS Cables LtdWith remarkable development in transmission and distribution infrastructure, Bangladesh has made considerable progress in the previous 13 years in providing power to the entire country.Our industry has so far benefited from current government policies. At the moment, we are primarily concerned with meeting domestic demand. We want to export our products even though the global market is extremely competitive, primarily because of Chinese and Indian companies. I would urge the government to support manufacturers who wish to export cables by rebating taxes by at least 10 percent. If the government approves it for five years, I believe we can build a robust sector during this time.Since its inception, BBS cables has been committed to maintaining its products to international standards. The fact that our cables are currently being utilised in the Karnaphuli Tunnel in Chattogram is proof of our commitment to quality.A.K.M. Ahasanul Haque Chief Operating Officer,
Partex Cables Ltd
The cable industry in Bangladesh grows by 10 to 15 percent annually. As power generation has increased 10 times, the cable industry has expanded. 
Now that underground cable networks must be built in our cities, where open spaces are quite scarce, the potential use of high-quality cables is clear.
We ensured our products were of the best quality when Partex Cables Ltd started commercial production in 2017. As a result, every year, we increase our share by 4 percent on average, and this year we anticipate an 8 percent increase.



We hope the government will set policies that will encourage us to export our goods and expand. We import raw materials from abroad by paying huge tax. So, if the government could come through with a temporary tax rebate, our cable industry would receive a significant boost.
 








Mahboob Hossain Mirdah Director & CEO, RR-Imperial Electricals Ltd
The widespread power distribution is not possible without a thriving local cable industry. The cable business is now worth over Tk 10,000–12,000 crore, up from Tk 6,000 crore in 2017.
Our raw material costs have nearly doubled.  Therefore, to develop this industry, I would appeal to the government for zero duty or a reduction of the duty fee in the case of importing raw materials.
Additionally, we want support to put an end to substandard and fake cables because they have the potential to cause devastating incidents. We should prioritise purchasing skin-coated cables and flame-retardant(FR) Cables.
RR Imperial Electricals LTD has introduced for the first time in Bangladesh FR and skin-coated technology since 2012. I want the government to mandate FR and skin-coated technology for all electrical cables. We can save lives and preserve the nation's resources by doing this only.

As the government has declared 100 percent electrification all over the country, cable industries have the scope to grow exponentially. Many big investors and companies are investing in this industry to meet national requirements. Currently, most of the cable required in Bangladesh is produced and marketed by local manufacturers, except for some specialised cables and extra-high-voltage cables. Within a short time, Bangladeshi manufacturers can also provide these cables.
This industry has much scope, but the raw material price fluctuation makes it challenging to increase profitability. Therefore, the government should give a level playing field by providing the same facility in duty and tax on imported materials and machines. We also need cash incentives on exports so that Bangladeshi manufacturers can export products.

They hosted 14.5 per cent of Bangladeshi expatriates between 1976 and 2019.On the other hand, Romania, a country in Eastern Europe, recently emerged as a new destination for labour market opportunities for Bangladesh with a handful of workers having already started to migrate there.Nurul Islam, a former director of the BMET, said while exploring new markets, the government should focus on the possibility of sending a high number of workers.Besides, the government needs to take an action plan to implement outcomes and recommendations generated from the research works, he said.Also, to get the maximum output, there should be coordination between officials concerned and the individual consultants during the research period, he said, suggesting inclusion of recruiting agents in the process.Although labour market research was conducted in the past by different international agencies and under the ministry's arrangements, those were not considered to be of the standard expected, he further said.  "

I am working on ""Joy Banglar Dhoni"", directed by KM Khurshid. I will be sharing the screen with Nirab Hossain, in this project. We are planning to begin the shooting of the film soon. I will be portraying Tara in both her youth and her old age.



The project became important to me, when my father insisted that I take the project.  Also, the plot and the role I will be portraying is very interesting.
 








How tough do you think it will be for you to pull off both roles in a single project?
It will be challenging for sure. However, I will try to understand the tone and time of the characters and I believe this will make my work easier to play the character on the screen.
Did you always want to become an actress?
I took dance tutorials since childhood. This is when the dream of becoming an actress started to grow. I always want to take up roles that are different from one another. I am very selective about the films I take up.

/news/bangladesh/transport/news/will-dhaka-finally-be-free-faulty-buses-3143856,Will Dhaka finally be free of faulty buses?,"The section 25 of ‍Road Transport Act-2018 clearly states that operation of unfit and rundown vehicles is a punishable offence and one may face up to six-month jail or Tk 25,000 fine or both.Besides, there are dedicated persons such as vehicle inspectors, at the offices of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), who are supposed to check all these aspects before giving fitness clearance to a particular vehicle.But, even with the strict legal provision and monitoring mechanism in place, rundown buses ply the city streets, contributing to  road crashes and pollution, under the very nose of the authorities.Although the authorities on several occasions took steps to drive such vehicles off the city streets, they often failed in face of the opposition from transport associations.BRTA once again decided  to conduct drives against such vehicles.The regulatory authority last week wrote letters to the transport associations for fixing problems of all faulty buses and minibuses within November 30, BRTA officials said.Otherwise, the authority will conduct a mobile court drive against the vehicles after the deadline, they said.BRTA has also published advertisements on different national dailies asking transport owners to fix their problem within November 30.In the meantime, BRTA has directed all of its vehicle inspectors not to provide fitness clearance to any faulty vehicles. Otherwise, punitive actions would be taken against them too, the officials added.WHY THE MOVE?The move came after the Road Transport and Highway Division last week asked BRTA to take strict action against rundown buses.Bangladesh is a developing country -- the beauty of the city and the image of the country largely depend on the vehicles operating in the city, said a BRTA official, citing the division's letter.But it has been observed that some discoloured and rundown buses with broken doors, windows and lights are being operated in the city.Besides, some buses emit black smoke while some with non-functional fans and filthy seat covers ply on the city streets, causing sufferings to passengers.Sitangshu Shekhar Biswas, director (engineering) of BRTA, said upon receiving a letter from the division, they have sent a letter to the transport associations to fix their faulty buses within November 30.""We are very serious about the move,"" he told The Daily Star last night.Letters were sent to Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association, Bangladesh Bus Truck Owners Association and Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation, another BRTA official said.Khondaker Enayet Ullah, secretary general of Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association, confirmed that they have received the letter.""We will ask all our members to comply with the BRTA directives,"" he told this correspondent last night.Meanwhile, BRTA headquarters, on October 11, has sent a letter to all vehicle inspectors not to provide fitness clearance to any faulty vehicles.If anyone does so, action would be taken against them as per the section 25 (2) of the Road Transport Act, reads the letter.DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENTA BRTA official said  they have given similar directives to the owners and even conducted drives against faulty vehicles on earlier occasions.But they could not achieve the desired results as transport owners and workers always took a stance against such  drives, he said seeking anonymity.Another BRTA official said it is difficult to maintain order on roads due to manpower crisis and lack of equipment at BRTA.He said there are some 125 vehicle inspectors at different offices of BRTA, and it is not possible for them to check all elements (around 60) of a bus before issuing fitness clearance.Besides, it is impossible to check all the bus elements manually, he said, adding that BRTA has only one vehicle inspector machine.So, most of the vehicles are being checked manually and some elements including emission of smoke can not be checked, he lamented.In this given situation, it is almost impossible to ensure operation of faultless vehicles in the capital due to lack of capacity. "
/sports/news/barcelona-spectacular-la-liga-warns-ancelotti-3143931,"Barcelona 'spectacular' in La Liga, warns Ancelotti","Barcelona's woeful European form has cast a shadow over their domestic resurgence, which will face the ultimate test on Sunday when they visit Real Madrid in a much anticipated El Clasico in LaLiga.A revamped Barca, spearheaded by new signing Robert Lewandowski, have won seven consecutive LaLiga matches and share the lead at the top of standings on 22 points with Spanish and European champions Real.Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti warned his team that Barcelona have been ""spectacular"" in La Liga, despite their struggles in the Champions League.Barcelona are on the verge of Champions League elimination after a 3-3 draw at home against Inter Milan on Wednesday, but come into Sunday's Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu as leaders, unbeaten in the top flight.Xavi's side have conceded just one goal all season in La Liga and lead Real Madrid on goal difference, both sides tied on 22 points at the top of the table.""We're looking at a team that's won all their games in La Liga after drawing their first one, they have very good form in the league,"" Ancelotti told a press conference on Saturday.""Since the start of the competition they have done every well. They've had trouble in the Champions League, which usually happens in that competition, but in La Liga they have been spectacular.""The coach remembered last season's 4-0 defeat by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu, where in the absence of striker Karim Benzema, he operated with Luka Modric as a false nine.""It's true that last year I tried to invent something and I paid the price for it,"" said Ancelotti.""The game last year will not affect us, because this is another season, another Clasico. We're looking forward to playing this game, which the whole world will watch.""Ancelotti confirmed that goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is back training after suffering sciatica but will not feature in the Clasico, while Antonio Rudiger can play, wearing a protective mask.The German defender suffered a bad facial injury against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League, where he scored a last minute goal but clashed heads with the opposition goalkeeper."
/life-living/food-recipes/news/healthy-diet-healthy-bodies-3143821,Healthy diet for healthy bodies,"Our bodies are important. They are the vessel through which we live and experience everything in this world, and so it is important we take care of them. And while exercise and good sleeping habits are important in keeping us healthy, in the end, it is diet and nutrition that play the largest role in maintaining and sustaining a healthy body. Consuming a balanced diet throughout one's life helps to prevent malnutrition in all of its manifestations, as well as a variety of diseases, illnesses, and other health problems. However, increased processed food production, rising urbanisation, and changing lifestyles have resulted in a shift in dietary trends. Individuals are eating more foods that are heavy in energy, fats, free sugars, and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables, and dietary fibres like whole grains.Individual attributes (e.g., age, gender, lifestyle, and level of physical activity), cultural background, regionally accessible foods, dietary habits as well as conditions such as heart problems, diabetes, etc. will all influence the exact composition of a diverse, balanced, and nutritious diet. However, the fundamental concepts of what defines a healthy diet remain unchanged. For one, a nutritious diet should include fruits and vegetables, grains, nuts, protein, carbohydrates as well as fats, salt, sugar, etc. but the amount and quantity needed will vary for special dietary needs.Vegetarianism is increasingly becoming popular, and for good reason too! Not only is it good for your body but it is also good for the environment and the world to consume less meat. To get the most out of a vegetarian diet, eat a range of healthy plant-based foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts, and whole grains. Simultaneously, limit your intake of less healthy options such as sugar, sweetened beverages, fruit juices, and refined carbohydrates. If you require assistance, a qualified dietitian or nutritionist can assist you in developing a vegetarian diet that is appropriate for you, especially because there are just so many types of vegetarian diets. As vegetarianism is a restrictive diet, pay close attention to certain nutrients such as protein, calcium, etc. Protein is important in your diet as it helps maintain healthy skin, bones, muscles, and organs and you can add it to your diet more with plant-based protein sources such as soy products and meat substitutes, legumes, lentils, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Calcium is necessary to build and maintain strong teeth and bones and you can easily substitute milk for calcium-enriched and fortified products such as cereals, soy milk, soy yoghurt, and tofu as well as dark green vegetables, such as kale, and broccoli. A diabetes diet simply entails consuming the healthiest foods that are naturally rich in nutrients while being low in fat and calories in moderation and adhering to regular mealtimes. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are essential when following a diabetic or pre-diabetic diet. It is of course recommended that you follow the diet developed for you by your doctors or dietician but here are some basic guidelines to get you started. For one, you must choose healthy carbohydrates, fibre-rich foods, and ""good"" fats. Healthy carbohydrates may include vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, such as beans, lentils, and peas, and avoid less healthy carbohydrates, such as those with additional fats, sweets, or sodium. Fibrous foods include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Foods high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can help decrease your cholesterol. Avocados, almonds, olive and peanut oils are all examples of 'healthy fats' however, it is advised to not overdo it as all fats are high in calories.A gluten-free or low-carb diet is gradually becoming more essential to controlling the signs and symptoms of coeliac disease and other gluten-related medical problems such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity, wheat allergy, etc. Once again, it is advised that you seek out a doctor, dietician, or nutritionist first, however, this is a general how-to for anyone starting or desiring a gluten-free or low-carb diet.In theory, a gluten-free diet seems easier to maintain than other diets — simply cut out gluten from your regular food plan and you are good to go! But in practice? It is a lot harder. For one, gluten is found in so many of our favourite foods such as most cakes, pies, pizza, bread, fries, and pastas as well as sauces such as soy sauce and mustard. That is a long list of foods you might have to say goodbye to forever! However, all is not lost. Many fresh, natural foods, such as fruits and vegetables, beans, seeds, legumes, and nuts in their original, unprocessed forms, as well as eggs and most kinds of protein and dairy products, can be included in a gluten-free diet as well as certain grains such as quinoa, rice as well as gluten-free flours. It is our primary duty to take care of our body, to nourish it properly, feed it, and love it. And it all starts and ends with healthy diets so we can have healthy bodies. Photo: Sazzad Ibne SayedStyling: RBR"

/supplements/world-food-day-2022/news/bazar365-environment-friendly-approach-online-shopping-3143851,Bazar365: An environment-friendly approach to online shopping ,"Every time we shop for groceries, it appears that plastic is an inevitable part of the experience. While many companies are slowly implementing upscaling, introducing paper bags and biodegradable plastic, consumers are often unaware of their overall plastic consumption. Bazar365 is an online marketplace targeting to mitigate this lack of awareness by creating an eco-friendly space for customers to fulfil their responsibilities. Bazar365's model aligns with SDG 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production. They are tackling this goal by creating a greener shopping experience and an eco-friendly marketplace.The business was conceptualised when Muntasir Rashid Bhuiyan and Alec Mithun took the initiative and decided to work towards one of the most pressing issues not only in Bangladesh but around the world — saving the environment. With the goal of creating an environmentally friendly ecosystem, Bazar365 was put into action giving customers the magical power to save the environment.Plastic is a man-made problem. Daily, we contribute to plastic consumption, thereby affecting the entire planet. Bazar365, the country's first eco-friendly online grocery and business model, is offering a solution to recycle its used plastic. The company enables its customers to check their plastic footprint and be conscious of their use of plastic.Many online marketplaces are offering convenient and easy grocery shopping. However, what sets Bazar365 apart is its green initiative and the emphasis they place on plastic management awareness. Starting with allowing their customers to keep track of the amount of plastic they use, to giving them the opportunity to recycle the plastic, customers have the option to avoid sending plastic into landfills and have the power to save the environment from their homes.When you get your delivery, you will inevitably find some plastic packaging. However, the store's policy allows you to save the plastic, and make a return during the next delivery. In doing so, you can collect reward points, which can later be used as a discount for your deliveries. As for the other waste material, it is passed onto their permitted recycling partners who ensure the safe disposal of immensely harmful material, fulfilling the main purpose of Bazar365. Long-time customers received plant pots made from returned plastic. Essentially, the customer does not have to look too far to live a greener lifestyle with Bazar365, that too, with added cost-efficient benefits.To ensure food safety, using biodegradable plastic is paramount. At Bazar365, they are used to package poultry and meat, and customers do not need to return them. Additionally, the packaging also targets to reduce waste and move towards plastic-free packaging. Furthermore, all the products are acquired from authorised sources.To maintain transparency and an ethical code, Bazar365 plans to open up its warehouse to customers so that they can visit and see how the manufacturing and packaging are done. Another step on the business's agenda is to reuse low-value plastic like candy wrappers, which cannot be properly recycled and does not even have a resale value. The business wants to utilise these plastics to develop a kind of grocery bag and add it to its return policy.Bazar365 hopes to expand within the Dhaka division in the next couple of months and hopes to go nationwide in the next two years. Customers can order from their website through Facebook Messenger or their hotline number. For customers living abroad who are looking to send groceries to their parents back home, a WhatsApp number is also available. Photo: Bazar365

/business/economy/news/revenue-collection-growth-slows-3143691,Revenue collection growth slows,"The revenue collection growth decelerated to 12.63 per cent in Bangladesh in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, driven by the cost-of-living crisis at home and abroad, narrowing the fiscal space for the government, official figures showed.  It was much lower than the 21 per cent growth recorded by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) in the first two months of 2022-23.The NBR collected Tk 65,737 crore in the forms of income tax, value-added tax (VAT) and customs tariffs between July and September, according to the provisional data of the tax administration. Revenue collection went up by 16.75 per cent to Tk 58,368 crore during the same three-month period in the previous fiscal year.A senior official of the NBR said the slow growth could be a seasonal effect caused by the lean economic activity in September.The lower revenue collection is the latest indicator that painted the grim economic scenario of Bangladesh as well as other parts of the world.Bangladesh's export earnings and remittance inflow both saw a drop in September.Export earnings slipped 6.25 per cent year-on-year to $3.9 billion in September, the first fall in 14 months, as runaway inflation in the western countries took its toll on Bangladesh's main foreign currency earning sector.Last month, consumer prices rose 8.2 per cent in the US and 10 per cent in the eurozone, the two biggest markets for the country.Similarly, remittances declined 11 per cent to $1.54 billion in September, the lowest in seven months, despite a surge in the outflow of migrant workers.The revenue collection in the July-September quarter was 92.25 per cent of the Tk 71,256 crore target set for the NBR during the period.Receipts from customs tariffs grew the highest 16.44 per cent to Tk 22,433 crore. It was Tk 19,266 crore during the same quarter of FY22, NBR data showed.The higher growth was largely caused by the escalated costs of commodities in the global markets and the sharp depreciation of the local currency against the US dollar amid the Russia-Ukraine war.   Income tax collection rose 11.55 per cent to Tk 20,087 crore in the July-September quarter, up from Tk 18,007 crore in FY22.However, receipts of VAT saw poor growth, which indicates a decline in the purchasing power of people amid the spiralling costs of commodities.The collection of VAT, the biggest source of revenue for the government, was up 10.06 per cent to Tk 23,215 crore, against Tk 21,094 crore in the previous year.In Bangladesh, inflation rose 7.48 per cent in July, 9.5 per cent in August and 9.1 per cent in September.The collection target for the NBR has been set at Tk 370,000 crore for FY23, which is 12.12 per cent more than Tk 300,000 crore generated in FY22.A senior official of the NBR, however, said the VAT collection in September would be higher than the provisional level as businesses file related returns by the 15th of the subsequent month.""We will get the actual picture regarding the VAT collection by October 22. Similarly, the collection from income tax will also increase. So, the overall collection will be higher than the preliminary receipts.""The official said the pace of collection from import tariffs did not increase much as most of the items that were imported had either zero or concessional import duty.Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said: ""The sluggish growth of VAT collection indicates that economic activities are slowing down. The growth in the collection that we see now is because of inflation.""The economist, however, noted that it was too early to reach a conclusion on the basis of preliminary figures.""But the revenue performance is very poor as 30 per cent growth in tax collection is needed. A big shortfall is looming on the horizon.""The former economist at the International Monetary Fund thinks the government will have to compromise fiscal management because of the current level of revenue collection.The government has reduced subsidy payment pressure by hiking petroleum prices. But subsidy pressure for fertiliser and for other purposes is deepening.""At the same time, the government will have to spend for social protection to protect the poor from prices spiral,"" he said.According to Mansur, the ultimate solution lies in reforms in the financial and fiscal sectors but the government is not undertaking them.""The government itself is putting itself in a tight position by not bringing in reforms.""Owing to the lower tax collection, the government's fiscal space has narrowed, he said. ""During difficult times, the government needs to spend but it does not have the capacity to do so currently.""Towfiqul Islam Khan, senior research fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, also said fiscal space is critical during the present crisis faced by the economy.He said the ability of the government to mobilise tax revenue would determine its scope to provide policy support to general people facing the uphill task of surviving amid the higher inflationary pressure.""The best way for the government is to curb tax evasion, which is rampant in Bangladesh. And, when commodity prices go up, tax evasion also soars, particularly in the area of trade."""

/star-health/news/birthweights-below-the-25th-percentile-linked-later-developmental-concerns-3143921,Birthweights below the 25th percentile linked to later developmental concerns,"Being born below the 25th percentile for birthweight may put a child at risk for developmental difficulties, according to a new study by Abiodun Adanikin of Coventry University, UK, and colleagues, published recently in the open access journal PLOS Medicine.Babies that are too big or too small are believed to be at risk of poor birth outcomes and problems related to childhood development, but little is known about this relationship across the entire range of birthweights for non-premature babies. To fill this gap, researchers studied the development of more than 600,000 infants born after 37 weeks of gestation in Scotland.At around two or three years of age, the children underwent evaluation for social development and for fine motor, gross motor and communication skills. The researchers looked for associations between birthweight and early childhood developmental concerns, taking into account complicating factors, such as the child's sex and gestational age at delivery, as well as the health, ethnicity and socio-economic status of the mother.The study showed that babies born below the 25th percentile for birthweight had a higher risk of developmental concerns compared to babies born between the 25th and 75th percentiles, with the smallest babies carrying the greatest risk. Babies born above the 75th percent of weights did not have a substantially increased risk of developmental concerns compared to babies born in the middle range.  The researchers conclude that having a low birthweight is an unrecognised and potentially important contributor to the prevalence of issues related to childhood development.Traditionally, babies below the 10th percentile were believed to be at risk for developmental concerns. But the new study found a greater number of babies within the 10th to 24th percentile range of birthweights with these issues, simply because there are a larger number of babies within that population."

Speaking at a rally in Mymensingh, he also said the recent by-election to Gaibandha-5 has proved BNP's observation that a fair election cannot be held under the AL government.
Fakhul said the government must quit and dissolve parliament by forming a neutral government.



""A fresh Election Commission must be constituted under the neutral government to conduct a credible election for establishing a government and a parliament of the people.""
As part of the party's planned divisional programmes, Mymensingh city BNP organised the rally on the Polytechnic Institute ground. Thousands of activists and leaders attended rally, presided over the unit's Convener Prof AKM Shafiqul Islam.
A chair was left vacant on the stage for the chief guest -- BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia.



The rally was organised to denounce the price hike of daily essentials and fuel, the death of five party men in police actions in Bhola, Narayanganj, Munshiganj and Jashore, and to demand Khaleda's unconditional release.
BNP leaders and activists from Mymensingh, Sherpur, Jamalpur, Netrakona, Tangail, and Kishoreganj thronged the rally braving various obstacles, threats, and attacks on their way.
The Polytechnic Institute was packed and the air was filled with slogans and the beats of drums.
The BNP alleged that an undeclared transport strike was enforced in Mymensingh division to prevent BNP men from joining the rally.
Fakhrul, in his speech, said their party, if voted to power, would restore democracy, lower the prices of daily essentials, fuel, and establish peace in the country.
Amid claps and slogans against the AL government, Fakhrul said, ""People have now woken up. The Awami League will be swept away by the turbulent wave of our movement from Teknaf to Tentulia,""
Yesterday's rally was the second BNP rally at the divisional level. The first one was held in Chattogram on Wednesday. The party would conclude the rallies with a mass gathering in Dhaka city on December 10.
Fakhrul said, ""It's a great victory. The brave sons of Mymensingh have demonstrated that they're ready to make any kind of sacrifice to protect democracy.""
He added that their men overcoming all barriers and odds have sent a message that the people of Bangladesh would no longer bow down.
""They must free this country from misrule.""
He further said, ""They [AL] have done the biggest damage by destroying the election system and depriving us of our ownership of the country and our right to change the government after every five years through votes.""
The BNP leader also said the government must free Khaleda without any condition and withdraw all political cases against opposition leaders and activists.
""We'll surely force this regime to quit and hold the election under a non-party administration through the united efforts of people.""

/world/europe/news/putin-corner-options-narrowing-3143891,Putin ‘in a corner’ with options narrowing,"US President Joe Biden admitted this week that American diplomats still did not know how Russian President Vladimir Putin could bring an end to his faltering war in Ukraine and save face. Western analysts see no good options.The question of Putin's ""off-ramp"" -- or decisions that allow him to end the fighting without admitting defeat -- has exercised Western policymakers and foreign policy experts since the very start of the war in February.""Where does he find a way out?"" Biden asked on Thursday while talking in New York. ""Where does he find himself in a position that he does not, not only lose face, but lose significant power within Russia?""A French diplomat, talking recently on condition of anonymity, stressed that European allies were no closer to reading Putin's thinking, other than his desire to secure what appears to be an increasingly unlikely military victory.""There's a war that he is not managing to win, but what would satisfy him? We don't have the answers,"" the diplomat said.Instead of looking for a negotiated climbdown, Putin has escalated in recent weeks, formally annexing four regions of Ukraine on September 30 and approving a partial mobilisation of up to 300,000 men for the war.On Friday, he said Moscow was ""doing everything right"" in its nearly eight-month invasion of Ukraine despite a string of embarrassing defeats against Kyiv's forces. In the latest sign of embarrassment for him, Kremlin-installed officials in the southern Kherson region, which Russia annexed, urged residents to leave as Kyiv said its soldiers were advancing on the oblast's main city.""What is happening today is not pleasant. But all the same, (if Russia hadn't attacked in February) we would have been in the same situation, only the conditions would have been worse for us,"" Putin told reporters after a summit in the capital of Kazakhstan.""So we're doing everything right,"" he insisted.Putin said there was no need for further massive strikes against Ukraine at present and claimed the Kremlin did not intend to destroy its pro-Western neighbour.He spoke days after Russia unleashed a wave of missile strikes on cities across Ukraine that left at least 20 civilians dead. Putin said the strikes were in retaliation for the explosion on the Crimea bridge, which he has described as a ""terrorist act"".""He may think the battlefield situation isn't great but things will settle down during the winter, that Ukrainian offences will come to an end, that they'll be able to mobilise,"" Eliot A Cohen, a military historian and former US State Department adviser, told AFP.""I think he's mistaken. I think the Russians are in a serious world of hurt,"" added Cohen, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at the US-based Johns Hopkins University.The Ukrainians are continuing to win back occupied territory in the northeast and south, while the Kremlin's mobilisation has led to rare dissent in Russia amid evidence that many recruits lack adequate weapons and kit.""Russia's behaviour is irrational,"" wrote Joris van Bladel, a fellow at the Belgian Royal Institute for International Relations think-tank. ""The only 'rational' element the Kremlin is counting on is time.""""Russia tries to buy time in the hope that the European countries will collapse before Russia's downfall,"" he added.Putin's escalation on the ground has also been accompanied by new rhetoric about the possible use of nuclear weapons which is directed at Western countries.Some analysts see it as a bluff and others as a sign of desperation.Western nations have signalled that they would feel compelled to react in some way if Russia crossed the nuclear threshold, raising the risk of direct conflict between the Nato military alliance and Moscow.""It's a very, very dangerous moment,"" former US secretary of state John Kerry said late last month.Putin is ""more in a corner than anyone would like him to be because that's not good for anybody"", Kerry told MSNBC on September 28.Kerry's comment has been echoed by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a key ally of Russia.In extracts of an interview with the American TV channel NBC released by Belarus's state news agency, Lukashenko said: ""The most important thing is, don't drive your interlocutor and even your opponent into a corner.

/supplements/bangladesh-cable-industry-outlook/news/local-cable-makers-now-international-calibre-3144011,Local cable makers now of international calibre,"Eastern Cables Limited, a subsidiary of the Bangladesh Steel and Engineering Corporation, was once the only cable manufacturer in Bangladesh.The company, which became a state-owned enterprise following the Liberation War, was established in Chattogram's Patenga in 1967 to manufacture pipes and other goods.New governments usually patronise heavy or non-heavy industries at the beginning stage, and Bangladesh was no exception.But in due time, local entrepreneurs came forward to invest in cable manufacturing in the late 80s, when the sector was mostly dependent on imports for setting up transmission lines and household wiring.Eventually, brands such as Paradise, BBS, BRB, Partex, SQ, Transcom Cables Ltd, RR Kabel, and Bizli emerged in the cable market as the entrepreneurs understood its business potential considering how the whole country would have power coverage in the future.With this backdrop, they utilised innovation to overcome various challenges and became devoted to developing the cable manufacturing industry.The public sector needs power transmission and distribution networks through overhead cables while the private sector needs it for households and industries.""The entrepreneurs had far sight and were innovative, and realised the future of the industry. So, some of them took the initiative to manufacture cables and cater to domestic demand,"" said A.K.M. Ahasanul Haque, chief operating officer of Partex Cables Ltd.The companies then started making new high quality products to fulfil the country's requirement for electrical and communication cables.  For example, the industry started with household wires and now manufacturers underground cables, marine cables, extra high voltage cables and more.""Now, the industry manufactures 33kv capacity extra high voltage cables while earlier they could make up to 11kv capacity cables,"" Haque said.""In this consideration the local companies developed their capacity and engaged their innovative ideas to contribute to the economy,"" he added.High-voltage cables, which include a conductor and insulation, are used for electric power transmission at high voltage.However, there are substandard cables currently in the market.""So, the government should do a market drive to remove substandard products and create awareness among consumers as it is an issue of safety,"" Haque said. He then said the government is prioritising power generation but does not give importance to ensuring quality power supply for households and the industrial sector.""If the government realise the necessity of quality power supply, the entire cable industry would benefit,"" he added. An industry insider said there are more than 150 small, medium and big cable manufacturers in the market, which is lead by BRB with a 41 percent share followed by Eastern with 15 percent, BBS 13 percent, Paradise, Partex and Bizli 6.5 percent each, and SQ 5.3 percent.Other players collectively account for 22.2 percent of the market.However, only 8 to 10 of these companies provide international standard products.Local manufacturers produce almost all kinds of cables, including communication cables, telephone wires, LAN cables, fibre optic cables, house wiring, extra high voltage cables, telecommunication cables and marine cables.Of them, only Partex, BRB, and BBS manufacture underground cables that provide extra safety.Haque then said the private sector consumes 70 percent of the market while the rest 30 percent goes to the public sector.Rafiqul Islam Rony, director of marketing and sales at BRB Cable Industries Limited, credited the government and entrepreneurs for developing the sector as the former took initiatives to generate power while the latter came forward to cater to the demand.He also said the sector has helped develop skilled manpower and generate employment.Rony then suggested the government provide support to local companies to reduce imports as they have built up the capacity to manufacture international standard cables.Cable manufacturers are currently dependent on raw material imports from Chile, China, India, Oman, Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore.""Local players would have thrived more had they gotten the big contracts of the Bangladesh Power Development Board and Rural Electrification Board, which go to Chinese vendors thanks to their lower offers,"" he said.The government is now emphasising on quality transmission and distribution to reduce the system loss. For this reason, the government has been purchasing cables from local manufacturers, which has helped the industry grow in the past decade, Rony added.Rakib Ahmed, head of marketing at Bizli Cables, a subsidiary of Pran-RFL Group, said the industry is growing due to the expansion of power grids across the country in the last six years.He then thanked the entrepreneurs for catering to the cable demand and thereby saving foreign exchange in line with the government's initiative for developing the power sector.Bangladesh Steel Re-Rolling Mills (BSRM) introduced a new construction cable called ""Low Relaxation Prestressed Steel Strand (LRPC strand)"" in a bid to cater to the Tk 3,000 crore market segment that is currently dominated by imports.The country's leading steel maker invested a total of around Tk 1,000 crore to establish an LRPC strand manufacturing unit under its new concern, BSRM Wires.The LRPC strands are used in the prestressing of concrete for different kinds of construction work.LRPC strands are used in pre-stressed concrete girders for building roads, flyovers, river and railway bridges, prestressed concrete domes, hollow core slabs, steel beams and TT slabs, silos, hangars, aqueducts and viaducts, as well as railway sleepers.There are currently a number of bridges, flyovers, and tunnels under construction where LRPC strands are being used.Tapan Sengupta, deputy managing director of BSRM, said the product is a new addition for the cable industry even though it is considered a construction material.The industrialists also alleged that the Chinese companies who implement grid line projects use substandard products to save costs, which is not possible for local companies that work with quality cables."

The latest video, which happened in Tehran's Argentina Square on Wednesday, showed a group of officers in protective gear and helmets surrounding a woman on a main road, reported BBC.One of them grabbed her by the neck and led her into a crowd of about two dozen police, many of whom are on motorcycles. While the woman was being forced towards one of the bikes, another officer approaches her from behind and puts his left hand on her bottom.The woman then crouched on the ground as more officers surrounded her. A female voice behind the camera was heard saying: ""They are pulling her hair.""Drivers in vehicles next to where it was happening started sounding their horns, a form of protest in similar situations seen in the past few days across the country.The woman, who appears to have no hijab, or headscarf, is then seen standing up and running away from the scene.At this point, the same voice on the clip was heard saying: ""Look at him [the security force officer], he is laughing"".The footage has been verified by the BBC's Persian service.Tehran's Police Public Relations office has said the incident is being investigated, state news agency Irna reported.The police statement did not give details of what happened, but said that ""enemies using psychological warfare tried to cause public anxiety and incite violence"".The fact that the incident happened in public has led human rights activists to question what security forces might also be doing behind closed doors.Mistreatment, including sexual and psychological abuse, has been reported by many inmates, especially political prisoners, for years.Many Iranians commented on social media that the video from Tehran had made them more determined to go out on the streets to protest, with one person saying they intended ""to put their anger and fury into action""."

We won't interfere if they are peaceful. But we'll surely take action if they become violent.""""I hope that the BNP will conduct their programmes in a disciplined way. We won't spare them, if they endanger people's lives and damage properties by blocking roads or resorting to vandalism,"" he added.Asaduzzaman said these on the sidelines of the inauguration ceremony of the mini-marathon and annual sports competition arranged by the Public Security Division at the Secretariat on Saturday.The minister urged the BNP leaders to be careful with the words that they speak.""You (the media) are alleging that ruling party activists are attacking BNP members at different places of the country. I'll request the BNP leaders to refrain from saying such things that incite violence. All the clashes between us (AL) and them (BNP) have happened due to verbal instigation,"" he said.   "
/star-health/news/the-power-kind-touch-3143911,The power of kind touch,"There was a cover story on 'The Power of Touch' in a recent National Geographic issue. There have been studies in the medical field that are finding healthful benefits for patients in the form of nonverbal communication such as a pat on the hand or a gentle form of skin-to-skin contact.The healing power of physical touch can be measured. Doctors have found, through laboratory tests, such as MRIs, that there are evident changes in the patterns of brain activity during touch. Certain types of endorphins are released. These endorphins combat stress hormones, resulting in a sense of relaxation and peace. Researchers have been working on physical touch and found a role of healing in the life of sick persons including of a cancer patient. However, it can be easy to forget that our human-to-human connections make a difference for our patients.It is true that our life is much easier today with a lot of gadgets, yet each and every day a lot of unexplainable sicknesses are also approaching slowly behind our familiarity. But, we cannot sidestep the concern of objects like 'Respect, Affection and Care (RAC)'.Yes, there is a great way of offering hope and reassurance through different types of communication skills including a sincere smile or kind facial expression. It is a way of connecting without saying a word. These can simply express, ""I feel your pain. I see you. I realise what you're going through.""Although physical touch shows a genuine form of care and concern, it is not always welcomed due to some misconduct. Nevertheless, we need to explore more how doctors can consciously use their interest in humanity and the power of caring in their clinical work.

/news/bangladesh/elections/news/rift-between-al-rebel-candidates-intensifies-3143756,"Rift between AL, rebel candidates intensifies","The rift between the ruling Awami League candidate and a rebel candidate has become visible in Sunamganj, ahead of the Zilla Parishad election, to be held tomorrow.As the preparations for the polls are all in place, the conflict between them has become more intense.The ruling party has nominated Advocate Khayrul Kabir Rumen, vice president of the district's AL unit and former public prosecutor of Sunamganj court, while his opponent is Nurul Huda Mukut, senior vice president of the unit and incumbent chairman of Sunamganj Zilla Parishad.On September 26, the district AL suspended Mukut from his post on the grounds of breaking party discipline, after he submitted his nomination as a rebel candidate.Rumen's brother Barrister Anamul Kabir Emon is the general secretary of the district AL unit and former administrator of the Zilla Parishad.On October 1, Mukut's wife Husna Huda, general secretary of the Sunamganj  unit of Awami Mahila League, was show-caused by the party for taking part in the election campaign for her husband.On October 2, Mukut filed written complaints to the returning officer, alleging that two AL lawmakers were influencing voters on behalf of his opponent.Meanwhile, last Wednesday, a petition was filed with the High Court on behalf of Rumen, stating that Mukut hid information about many of his properties in the affidavit submitted along with the nomination paper.About the electoral environment, Rumen said, ""The environment is overall good, but the rebel candidate is spending money to buy out  voters. He is also intimidating them and acting like a goon.""""He is misusing his position as the chairman... I have verbally informed about his activities to the returning officer,"" he said.On the other hand, Mukut said, ""He [Rumen] is being strongly backed by AL lawmakers. They are also confusing the voters by saying that AL will eventually know who will vote for whom and will take actions accordingly.""""I have been the district AL general secretary for 18 years, including from 2001 to 2006. Rumen and his brother Emon became AL leaders during its good days, yet the party chose wrongly again. I will prove again that the decision to nominate him is wrong as I did in 2016,"" he said.Notably, in the 2016 Zilla Parishad election, Mukut won the polls as a rebel candidate by defeating Rumen's brother Emon.Last Thursday, a meeting, presided over by Jahangir Hossain, returning officer of the polls and deputy commissioner of Sunamganj, alerted candidates not to create chaos in the polling centres.In the polls, 1,229 voters are going to cast their votes at 12 centres."
/health/disease/news/dengue-menace-may-linger-till-mid-november-experts-3144051,Dengue menace may linger till mid-November: Experts,"The gradual increase in dengue infection has created panic among the Dhaka city dwellers. Hospitals are failing to cope with the pressure of dengue patients despite setting up new wards.A total of 89 people has died of dengue till October 15 this year. Doctors of Dhaka Shishu Hospital said that 119 children have been admitted with the disease in the first 12 days of this month. While visiting various hospitals in the capital, the UNB saw that people were lying on the floors due to a lack of hospital beds.Doctors and health experts say that measures taken by the city corporations and other authorities are not effective. The publicity and drives carried out by the authorities to destroy larvae of Aedes mosquito, the carrier of the dengue virus, are appearing to be inadequate.""Creating awareness among the public is a must to rein in the dengue menace. We've taken various steps in this regard,"" Prof Dr Ahmedul Kabir, Additional Director General (Additional DG) of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), told UNB.""Most of the casualties from dengue are happening outside Dhaka city. People aged between 40-50 years are the worst victim of the disease. It's taking only three days for dengue patients to die from this disease,"" Kabir added.Public health expert Dr Mohammad Abdus Sabur Khan said that although dengue intensity usually decreases in September, but this time the situation has reversed.""It's October now, but dengue is showing no sign of retreating. It seems like dengue will prevail till mid-November this time,"" Dr Abdus Sabur said.He added that the under-construction buildings are the primary breeding grounds of Aedes mosquito.""City corporations are conducting drives at people's houses. But the construction sites are always covered by fences. As a result, the authorities can't reach these places and thus the dengue menace goes on unabated,"" he added.Dr Nazmul Islam, director of Disease Control Department of DGHS, described the activities that his institution was carrying out to prevent dengue.""We do two things. Firstly, we prepare the hospitals for dengue treatment by keeping the doctors and the health care workers updated through training. Secondly, we conduct surveys in the two city corporations of Dhaka and submit the report to the local government authorities. According to our survey this year, the dengue epidemic has hit both the south and the north equally,"" Nazmul said.Nazmul added that dengue infection increases when the number of mosquitoes rises. He termed the current measures taken up by the authorities as a loss project as the breeding grounds of the Aedes mosquitoes still exist.According to the DGHS, a total of 24,326 people has been affected with dengue till October 15 of this year, while the number was 28,429 in 2021.The highest number of people infected by dengue was in 2019, when a staggering 1,01,354 people were infected with the virus.The same goes for mortality caused by dengue. In 2019, a record 179 people had died of dengue, while the figure has been 89 to date this year.Dr ABM Abdullah, an Emeritus Professor and the personal physician of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, provided some guidelines to fight dengue.""First of all, if anyone is infected with dengue, he has to consult a doctor and start taking medicines according to the prescription. Some people tend to think that a mild fever won't do any harm. This line of thinking must be discarded. People suffering from fever must test themselves, and if dengue is identified, he has to be admitted in hospitals immediately,"" Abdullah said.Selim Reza, chief executive officer (CEO) of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), claimed that they are conducting drives to weed out dengue from localities, although he could not justify why they're being unable to conduct drives at construction sites.Farid Ahmed, chief executive officer (CEO) of Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), said that they've fined numerous building owners for not cleaning stale water, the place where Aedes mosquitoes lay eggs.""Mass awareness is necessary to fight Dengue. If the people are aware then Dengue won't be able to do any harm,"" Farid said."
/middle-east/news/iran-prison-fire-4-killed-61-injured-protests-continue-3144311,"Iran prison fire: 4 killed, 61 injured as protests continue","A fire at Iran's Evin prison late on Saturday killed four detainees and injured 61, state media reported, as anti-government protests sparked by a woman's death in police custody continued on Sunday, including at several universities.Iranian authorities said on Saturday that a prison workshop had been set on fire ""after a fight among a number of prisoners convicted of financial crimes and theft"". Evin holds many detainees facing security charges, including Iranians with dual nationality.Iran's judiciary said four of those injured in Saturday's fire were in critical condition and that those killed had died of smoke inhalation, Iranian state media reported.Earlier state television aired video apparently showing that calm had returned to the facility.The protests sparked by 22-year-old Mahsa Amini's death while in the custody of Iran's morality police on Sept. 16 have turned into one of the boldest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 revolution, and have been met with a brutal state crackdown.Rights groups say at least 240 protesters have been killed, including 32 minors. The authorities have not published a death toll.Protests continued at several universities on Sunday, including in the cities of Tabriz and Rasht, to a heavy deployment of riot police. Videos posted on social media showed students at a Tehran university chanting: ""Iran has turned into a big prison. Evin prison has become a slaughterhouse.""Reuters could not independently verify the footage.Families of some political detainees at Evin prison took to social media to call on the authorities to ensure their safety, which in 2018 was blacklisted by the U.S. government for ""serious human rights abuses"".Footage of the prison aired on state television hours later showed firefighters inspecting a workshop with fire damage to the roof. It also showed inmates asleep in their wards.Atena Daemi, a human rights activist, said that relatives of prisoners held in the women's section had gathered at the prison for routine visiting hours, but that the authorities had denied them access, resulting in a standoff.The relatives were told that the prisoners were ""fine, but the phones are broken"", according to Daemi. However, she later tweeted that some women prisoners had called their families briefly.A lawyer representing an American Iranian held at Evin, Siamak Namazi, imprisoned for nearly seven years on espionage-related charges rejected by Washington as baseless, said on Sunday that Namazi had contacted his relatives.Several other dual national Iranians and foreign citizens are held in Evin prison mostly for security-related charges.""I am pleased to report that #SiamakNamazi has now spoken to his family. He is safe and has been moved to a secure area of Evin Prison. We have no further details at this time,"" Jared Genser said in a tweet.The husband of Iranian journalist Niloofar Hamedi, who broke the news of Amini's death and was arrested last month, also wrote on Twitter that she had telephoned him on Sunday.VIOLENT CRACKDOWNAsked about the prison fire, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters during a campaign trip on Saturday to Portland, Oregon that the Iranian government was ""so oppressive"" and that he was surprised by the courage of the Iranian protesters.Iran's foreign ministry said Biden had interfered in state matters by showing support for the anti-government protests.Rights groups said at least 240 protesters had been killed in the anti-government protests, including 32 minors. Over 8,000 people had been arrested in 111 cities and towns, Iranian activist news agency HRANA said on Saturday.Among the casualties have been teenage girls whose deaths have become a rallying cry for more demonstrations across the country.Iran, which has blamed the violence on enemies at home and abroad, deny security forces have killed protesters. State media said on Saturday at least 26 members of the security forces had been killed by ""rioters"".The protests have attracted international condemnation, with the United States, Canada and some European countries imposing sanctions on Iranian officials and organisations they accuse of being involved in the clampdown on protesters.""On Saturday ... Biden interfered in Iran's state matters by supporting the riots ... In recent days, the U.S. administration has tried desperately to inflame unrest in Iran under various excuses,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said, Iran's state media reported.The protests mark one of the boldest challenges to clerical rule since the 1979 revolution, with demonstrations spreading across the country and widespread calls for the downfall the Islamic Republic, even if the unrest does not seem close to toppling the system."

However, we can go forward by working together regionally.""In the post-pandemic world, when all global powers are rethinking about their value chains, South Asian countries must think about further enhancing sub-regional cooperation, analysts said 


In the post-pandemic world, when all global powers are rethinking about their value chains, South Asian countries must think about further enhancing sub-regional cooperation, analysts said There is no shortage of rationale for increasing regional trade cooperation among South Asian countries, said Bangladesh Bank's former governor Atiur Rahman.The trade between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal increased by six times between 2015 and 2019, he said.But still unexploited regional trade potential for Bangladesh remains to be as high as 93 per cent, he added.To utilise the untapped potential, South Asian countries need to invest more on improving regional connectivity, he suggested.Rahman made the remarks while presenting a keynote paper on regional connectivity for sustainable growth.Prof Dr Javed Siddiqui of the accounting and finance division in Alliance Manchester Business School UK, gave a keynote speech on the event's technical session one moderated by Bangladesh Bank Board Director Mahbub Ahmed.Senior Commerce Secretary Tapan Kanti Ghosh moderated the technical session two where ICAB's Council Member Sabbir Ahmed presented another keynote paper on ""Current trend of regional economy: role of Professional Accountancy Organizations"".There is a strong correlation between the number of accountants working in economies with gross domestic product per capita and an even stronger correlation with the UN Human Development Index, said Ahmed, who is also a partner of the Hoda Vasi Chowdhury & Co, Chartered Accountants.Professional accounting bodies can play active role in improving a country's ease of doing business index through providing practical insights and sharing best practice examples from other countries, he further said.ICAB President Md Shahadat Hossain also spoke.

In line with this theme, we need to make sure our children are growing up healthy and have access to nutritious foods, whether at home or school.Ask any parent and they will say how difficult it is to develop healthy eating habits in their child, especially the school-going ones as they are easily enticed by unhealthy, ready to eat, junk foods instead of nutritious meals. To help maintain healthy food habits, we recommend four essential food groups for the children down below.Fruits and VegetablesVitamins, antioxidants, fibre, water, fruits and vegetables are an essential source of nutrient that helps children from diseases later in life. We know for most children fruit-and-vegetable heavy meals can be unappealing, but we must encourage them to try out fruits and vegetables of different colours and tastes, freshly sourced or cooked.""I regularly give my son almond and cashew nuts in addition to fruits like apples, bananas, oranges, and grapes. Children like fruit salads as its quite colourful and nutritious, so I often make that for my son, along with putting vegetables like carrot, and cucumber in his meals,"" said Nusrat Ali Hasnat, a homemaker and mother of a seven-year-old son residing in Bashundhara.Grain foodsChildren need energy to grow, develop and learn, and grain foods like pasta, rice, corn, oats, and barley are essential to help children achieve the necessary growth. The best thing about whole grain foods is that they keep children full for a long time and in turn, make them feel energetic, thanks to having a low glycaemic index.Dairy productsA great source of protein and calcium, dairy foods like milk, cheese, and yoghurt are ideal healthy food options for children. Children should be encouraged to have different kinds of dairy regularly. This can include drinking milk, cheese slices, or a bowl of yoghurt.""I actually include a lot of dairy as part of my son's regular foods, like making cheese sandwiches. To maintain a healthy weight, I try to include butter in his food whenever possible,"" stated Nusrat.Protein-rich foods
Protein-rich foods are very important for growth and muscle development of children. Foods like lean meat, fish, chicken, beans, eggs, and lentils are high in protein as these also contain many other useful vitamins and minerals like iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. Omega-3 fatty acids from oily fish and lean red meat are especially important for children's learning and brain development.
Protein-rich foods are especially ideal for children's tiffin, as they need to be in school for a long time. Healthy protein-rich food ensures that they are not devoid of energy and have all the essential nutrients outside of the home.
When asked what her ideal tiffin for her son looks like, Nusrat said, ""In addition to fruit salad and vegetables, I like to make foods like burgers for my son's tiffin. For the patty, I use chicken breast pieces with some salt and pepper and marinate them the night before, so that the patty will be delicious and healthy!""
Essential drinking and foods that should be consumed less
When it comes to healthy drinks, just sticking to plain water can do the trick and along with the necessary food elements, it is fortified with fluoride for strong teeth. In addition, fruit juices can be great for children, as long as it is homemade and not too full of sugar.
Foods that contain lots of salt and sugar put children at risk of health conditions like childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes. Also, overconsumption of these foods leads to unhealthy weight gain.
Of course, children being the free spirit they are, it can be downright impossible to stop them from consuming junk food. So instead of outright forbidding these foods, we have to make sure children will eat them only from time to time, under parental supervision, and even then, foods high in salt, sugar, and saturated food should be consumed in limited quantities.

The family, whose history is inextricably linked to India's ""grand old party,"" has decided not to enter the leadership race, thus providing Congress a unique opportunity to revitalise itself ahead of the crucial 2024 general election.I am one of the two candidates, along with Congress veteran Mallikarjun Kharge.The Nehru-Gandhi family's decision to step aside, together with the potential implications for the 2024 election, has revived public interest in Congress. It has also provided a welcome distraction from the party's infighting and latest electoral defeats. As the 9,000 party delegates cast their ballots, former Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is leading marches from Kanyakumari to Kashmir as part of the party's 150-day ""national unity march"" (Bharat Jodo Yatra).The 136-year-old Congress has a storied history, but it finds itself at a crossroads following several successive election defeats at the national and state levels. True, the party has bounced back from similar setbacks, such as the electoral routs of 1977, 1989, and 1996. The tragic assassinations of leaders Indira Gandhi in 1984 and Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 were immediately followed by general-election victories. But the 2019 general election loss and Rahul Gandhi's subsequent resignation as party president have resulted in a three-year-long leadership crisis.How can Congress overcome its current challenges? In addition to electing a new president, it should hold elections for the Congress Working Committee, the party's principal executive body. Allowing the party's rank-and-file members to choose who will lead this powerful body would help legitimise the party's incoming leaders, giving them a clear mandate for a much-needed renewal.A new leadership would also galvanise voters. After the members of the UK Conservative Party picked Boris Johnson to succeed Theresa May as party leader and prime minister in 2019, for example, the Tories won their biggest parliamentary majority since 1987.Whatever the outcome of the current contest for Congress leadership, I believe it can revive the party and contribute to the defence of Indian democracy. While the party's presidential election is an internal exercise, it also offers Congress a chance to energise its political base and generate wider public interest.The Gandhi family's decision to step aside is the key to this potential renewal. Two candidates putting forward their visions for the party and the nation, and submitting themselves to a democratic vote, ends the talk of ""dynasty politics."" Moreover, it highlights the fact that no other Indian political party has a comparable process to determine its future leadership. By adhering to its constitution, Congress may inspire other political parties to step into the sunlight of internal democracy.But for Congress to return to power, the party's new elected leader will have to find a way to increase the party's appeal beyond its die-hard supporters. The party received only 19 percent of the vote in the 2014 and 2019 general elections, losing voters to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). To win them back, Congress requires youthful energy and fresh ideas that can challenge the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-chauvinist ideology. This requires a party leader who understands the aspirations of young Indians and firmly believes that Congress can put the country on a better path.To help India seize the opportunities the 21st century offers, Congress must articulate a positive and aspirational vision for the country's future. But first, it must fix the organisational and structural deficiencies that have impeded the party's recent election campaigns. Its next president must combine effective leadership with organisational reforms. Delegating powers to state leaders, for example, would free the new Congress leader from onerous administrative tasks and help create the strong local leadership that in previous decades undergirded the party's national appeal.None of this will be easy. But throughout its history, Congress has shown an immense capacity to weather changes and adapt to shifting political circumstances. The people of India are tired of the BJP's domineering and increasingly divisive governance style. To unite the country and reinvent itself, Congress must use the national unity march and the upcoming presidential election to position itself as a clear ideological alternative. India deserves no less. Shashi Tharoor, a former UN under-secretary-general, is an MP for the Indian National Congress.

/news/bangladesh/news/house-tutors-not-the-house-3143846,House tutors not in the house,"The house tutors at the dormitories of Dhaka University are assigned to hear and solve problems of the residential students, as per the university ordinance.However, finding them has become an ordeal for students as they are rarely available.These tutors are responsible for the education and overall well-being of students. But they are hardly present at the dorms, while most of the students don't even know where to go when they are in trouble.The 1973 DU ordinance directed the hall authorities ""to supervise and control the residence, and discipline of the students of the university, to regulate their extra-curricular activities and to make arrangement for promoting their health.""However, it didn't specifically mention the responsibilities of house tutors.But on March 27, the university authorities provided specific guidelines for house tutors, instructing them to be available at the dorm offices, to visit the floors (block) under them at least once in a week, and to hold at least one monthly views-exchange meeting with students.The purpose of such meetings was to listen to students' problems and solve them.There are around 150 house tutors in 13 male dormitories and 73 tutors in five female halls, according to the DU administration.This correspondent asked at least 10 students of the Shahid ATM Jafor Alam block of the Shaheed Sergeant Zahurul Huq Hall about how many times their house tutor visited their blocks this year.The respondents said the house tutor responsible for their floor, Rafat Alam Mishu, an assistant professor of the Bangla department, visited them only once since October last year.""But it was not for hearing or solving our problems,"" said Imran Hossain, a master's student.Contacted, Rafat Alam said though he could not visit his floor on a regular basis, he remains available at his office regularly. ""My doors are always open to students,"" he said.Interestingly, some students of the hall couldn't even tell the name of their house tutors.Mustakim Rahman, a master's student of Zahurul Huq hall, said, ""I saw our house tutor only three times in my five-year hall life.""''I can't even remember whether the house tutor visited my block... I don't even know who is the house tutor of my block,"" said Mohammad Hira Sarkar, a final-year student of the hall.The provost of the hall, Dr Muhammad Abdur Rahim, claimed that the house tutors ""try"" to visit the halls regularly, but sometimes fail to make time out of their busy schedules.This correspondent found the same status quo prevailing after visiting other male dorms.Tawhid Hasan Duha, a final-year student of Bijoy Ekattor Hall, said the house tutors visit their dorms only once a year, when seats are re-allocated.Seeking anonymity, a final-year student of the Dr Muhammad Shahidullah Hall said, ""The seats are mainly distributed by the leaders of Chhatra League, not by house tutors.""Contacted, Touhid Hossain, a house tutor of the hall, denied the allegations. He, however, said there are ""rooms for improvement"".FEMALE HALLS IN A BETTER STATE
The situation at the five female halls is somewhat better than that of the male halls, found this correspondent.
At least 10 students of the female halls told this newspaper that the house tutors visit the concerned block once or twice a month.
They said the teachers often call them to their offices to listen to their problems and allocate seats impartially, braving political influences.
Kanika Debnath, a final-year student of Sufia kamal Hall, said the house tutor of her block is sincere and seats are allocated fairly.
THE AUTHORITIES' TAKE
Prof Abdul Basir, convener of the provost standing committee, said though there was no written guideline for house tutors earlier, it is not the case anymore.
""A house tutor is provided with residential facilities and Tk 2,100 remuneration per month on top of their salaries. So, they should perform their duties properly,"" he added.
Prof Md Akhtaruzzaman, vice-chancellor of the university, said, ""The guidelines for house tutors did not exist in writings before. That's not the case anymore. Now, students can know about their rights, which will help them improve their residential life.""
""If any inconsistency is noticed, students should complain to the hall authorities (provost) immediately,"" he added.

/business/global-economy/news/russia-war-most-important-factor-slowing-growth-imf-3143621,Russia war ‘most important’ factor slowing growth: IMF,"Russia's war in Ukraine is the ""single most important element"" slowing economic growth and generating global instability, the chair of a key IMF committee said on Friday.Nadia Calvino's remarks came as finance ministers and central bankers gathered in Washington for the IMF and World Bank annual meetings, which focused on the war, soaring inflation and the climate crisis.There has been a ""very strong call"" throughout the week for Russia to stop its war against Ukraine, said Calvino, who is chair of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and also Spain's economy minister.""The war is the single most important element slowing down growth and generating inflation, volatility, energy and food insecurity and uncertainty,"" she told a press conference, describing peace as a key economic policy tool.But the committee, which Russia is involved in, failed to reach an agreement on a communique as Russia blocked a consensus, Calvino added.Instead, she issued a chair's statement recognising that the pandemic and war were ""weighing heavily on economic activity"" with significant impact on livelihoods.The statement also said countries welcomed voluntary contributions to facilitate financial assistance to Ukraine.On Thursday, the Group of 20 major economies closed talks in Washington without issuing a joint communique either, as in its last two gatherings, with the group also divided over Russia's invasion and as a US-Saudi feud intensified.""Stop the war... Wouldn't you be thinking that this is a more straightforward way to get the world economy in better shape?"" IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva asked at the Friday press briefing.This week, the International Monetary Fund said more than a third of the global economy is headed for contraction this year or next, cautioning that the three biggest economies will continue to stall.The fund trimmed its world growth forecast to 2.7 per cent in 2023, and its chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas cautioned that the next year would feel like a recession for many people.Throughout its meetings of financial chiefs this week, the crisis lender stressed that the priority was for central banks to continue tightening monetary policy to rein in inflation, and for governments to keep their budgets tight. "

/supplements/world-food-day-2022/news/healthy-diet-healthy-bodies-3143971,Healthy diet for healthy bodies,"Our bodies are important. They are the vessel through which we live and experience everything in this world, and so it is important we take care of them. And while exercise and good sleeping habits are important in keeping us healthy, in the end, it is diet and nutrition that play the largest role in maintaining and sustaining a healthy body.Consuming a balanced diet throughout one's life helps to prevent malnutrition in all of its manifestations, as well as a variety of diseases, illnesses, and other health problems. However, increased processed food production, rising urbanisation, and changing lifestyles have resulted in a shift in dietary trends.Individuals are eating more foods that are heavy in energy, fats, free sugars, and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables, and dietary fibres like whole grains.Individual attributes (e.g., age, gender, lifestyle, and level of physical activity), cultural background, regionally accessible foods, dietary habits as well as conditions such as heart problems, diabetes, etc. will all influence the exact composition of a diverse, balanced, and nutritious diet. However, the fundamental concepts of what defines a healthy diet remain unchanged. For one, a nutritious diet should include fruits and vegetables, grains, nuts, protein, carbohydrates as well as fats, salt, sugar, etc. but the amount and quantity needed will vary for special dietary needs.A vegetarian diet
Vegetarianism is increasingly becoming popular, and for good reason too! Not only is it good for your body but it is also good for the environment and the world to consume less meat. To get the most out of a vegetarian diet, eat a range of healthy plant-based foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts, and whole grains.
Simultaneously, limit your intake of less healthy options such as sugar, sweetened beverages, fruit juices, and refined carbohydrates. If you require assistance, a qualified dietitian or nutritionist can assist you in developing a vegetarian diet that is appropriate for you, especially because there are just so many types of vegetarian diets.
As vegetarianism is a restrictive diet, pay close attention to certain nutrients such as protein, calcium, etc. Protein is important in your diet as it helps maintain healthy skin, bones, muscles, and organs and you can add it to your diet more with plant-based protein sources such as soy products and meat substitutes, legumes, lentils, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.



Calcium is necessary to build and maintain strong teeth and bones and you can easily substitute milk for calcium-enriched and fortified products such as cereals, soy milk, soy yoghurt, and tofu as well as dark green vegetables, such as kale, and broccoli.
 








Diabetes or pre-diabetic diet
A diabetes diet simply entails consuming the healthiest foods that are naturally rich in nutrients while being low in fat and calories in moderation and adhering to regular mealtimes. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are essential when following a diabetic or pre-diabetic diet. It is of course recommended that you follow the diet developed for you by your doctors or dietician but here are some basic guidelines to get you started.
For one, you must choose healthy carbohydrates, fibre-rich foods, and ""good"" fats. Healthy carbohydrates may include vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, such as beans, lentils, and peas, and avoid less healthy carbohydrates, such as those with additional fats, sweets, or sodium.
Fibrous foods include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Foods high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can help decrease your cholesterol. Avocados, almonds, olive and peanut oils are all examples of 'healthy fats' however, it is advised to not overdo it as all fats are high in calories.
Gluten-free or low-carb diet
A gluten-free or low-carb diet is gradually becoming more essential to controlling the signs and symptoms of coeliac disease and other gluten-related medical problems such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity, wheat allergy, etc. Once again, it is advised that you seek out a doctor, dietician, or nutritionist first, however, this is a general how-to for anyone starting or desiring a gluten-free or low-carb diet.
In theory, a gluten-free diet seems easier to maintain than other diets — simply cut out gluten from your regular food plan and you are good to go! But in practice? It is a lot harder. For one, gluten is found in so many of our favourite foods such as most cakes, pies, pizza, bread, fries, and pastas as well as sauces such as soy sauce and mustard. That is a long list of foods you might have to say goodbye to forever!
However, all is not lost. Many fresh, natural foods, such as fruits and vegetables, beans, seeds, legumes, and nuts in their original, unprocessed forms, as well as eggs and most kinds of protein and dairy products, can be included in a gluten-free diet as well as certain grains such as quinoa, rice as well as gluten-free flours.
It is our primary duty to take care of our body, to nourish it properly, feed it, and love it. And it all starts and ends with healthy diets so we can have healthy bodies.

Avocados, almonds, olive and peanut oils are all examples of 'healthy fats' however, it is advised to not overdo it as all fats are high in calories.Gluten-free or low-carb dietA gluten-free or low-carb diet is gradually becoming more essential to controlling the signs and symptoms of coeliac disease and other gluten-related medical problems such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity, wheat allergy, etc. Once again, it is advised that you seek out a doctor, dietician, or nutritionist first, however, this is a general how-to for anyone starting or desiring a gluten-free or low-carb diet.In theory, a gluten-free diet seems easier to maintain than other diets — simply cut out gluten from your regular food plan and you are good to go! But in practice? It is a lot harder. For one, gluten is found in so many of our favourite foods such as most cakes, pies, pizza, bread, fries, and pastas as well as sauces such as soy sauce and mustard. That is a long list of foods you might have to say goodbye to forever!However, all is not lost. Many fresh, natural foods, such as fruits and vegetables, beans, seeds, legumes, and nuts in their original, unprocessed forms, as well as eggs and most kinds of protein and dairy products, can be included in a gluten-free diet as well as certain grains such as quinoa, rice as well as gluten-free flours.It is our primary duty to take care of our body, to nourish it properly, feed it, and love it. And it all starts and ends with healthy diets so we can have healthy bodies. Photo: Sazzad Ibne SayedStyling: RBR"

/business/global-economy/news/pound-slides-3143561,Pound slides,"The pound fell on Friday after under-fire British Prime Minister Liz Truss sacked her finance minister and made a dramatic policy U-turn, while an equity rally ran out of steam.The yen struck a new three-decade dollar low as a rise in US inflation expectations cemented expectations of more hefty Federal Reserve rate hikes.Truss sacked finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng as pressure mounted on her government following last month's big-spending, tax-slashing mini-budget, which spooked markets.The September 23 budget sent the pound tumbling to a record dollar low, near parity with the greenback, and bond yields surged before stabilising thanks to interventions by the Bank of England.Sterling sank more than one per cent to under $1.12 after Truss dismissed Kwarteng.It fell even lower after Truss appointed Jeremy Hunt as her new finance minister and announced a dramatic policy U-turn, before clawing back some of its losses.In her first Downing Street press conference, Truss stated the ""need to act now to reassure the markets,"" abandoned her plans to eliminate an increase in corporation tax and said spending would not increase as rapidly as planned.""The soap opera that is UK politics continues to dominate FX (forex) markets Friday,"" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.UK 10-year government bond yields rose after the Bank of England publicly stated it would end its costly market interventions on Friday.""Unfortunately for Truss, her swift ability to spook markets with a swathe of unfunded spending plans is now being followed by yet another rise in yields, as markets wonder whether we could soon see another push to replace her,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at online trading platform IG.London's FTSE 100 ended the day with an increase of 0.1 per cent, having given up most of its earlier gains because Truss's U-turn left her position fragile.Berenberg bank Senior Economist Kallum Pickering said ""the policy U-turn is a major humiliation for Truss"" and weakens her politically.""It is not easy to see how Truss -- whose personal mandate is now in tatters -- can continue as PM for long,"" he added.While European markets ended higher, Wall Street failed to hold onto gains made on Thursday in a surprising rally despite data showing strong inflationary pressures in the United States.After rising early on, US stocks resumed their downward spiral, with the S&P 500 losing 2.4 per cent.US retail sales in September were virtually unchanged from August at $684 billion, Commerce Department data showed in a report that revealed the drag on consumers from inflation.Meanwhile, consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan came in slightly better than expected, but the report cautioned of a ""bumpy road ahead for consumers"" due to uncertainty over inflation and the state of financial markets.Third quarter earnings season got into full swing, with a number of large banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, reporting lower earnings and setting aside more funds in preparation for a possible recession, although their performances topped analyst estimates. "
/sports/news/shakib-downplays-expectations-3143936,Shakib downplays expectations,"Although there have been many times over the years when the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and cricketers have not seen eye-to-eye, it seems they are aligned in the same direction when it comes to playing down expectations before starting their T20 World Cup campaign.There have been persistent questions about Bangladesh's performances, especially in the shortest format of the game. Their last T20 World Cup campaign even saw Bangladesh lose to Scotland in the qualifying stage before the Tigers went on to lose all their Super 12 matches.But despite getting a year to change things, the BCB remained clueless about chalking out the areas they needed to work on. The board instead was busy chopping and changing, from the coaching staff to the team, or dropping senior players like former captain Mahmudullah Riyad from the World Cup squad.BCB president Nazmul Hassan had tempered expectations a month ahead of the mega-event, saying the board was planning drastic changes and focusing on the next World Cup.""Our main focus is the next World Cup, not this one. You can't change everything overnight. We are planning long-term and trying to prepare a squad for the next World Cup. Even if the upcoming World Cup does not go well for us, I won't be disappointed. We are hoping to form a squad in the next six to eight months,"" Hassan told media last month.Interestingly, Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan echoed those sentiments during the 'Captain's Media Day' at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne yesterday, which involved all 16 captains.Shakib very matter-of-factly raised a very alarming issue, quipping about how he had not played a T20I in Australia during his 15-year international career and that the Tigers had never toured down under to play a T20I series.""I think we have a very exciting team. Most of them are new, so it will be a great experience for them. All of us are playing a T20I in Australia for the first time, including myself. So that's new,"" Shakib said.His remark stunned even the host running the media session, prompting Shakib to reply: ""Yes. And I've been playing for 15 years.""His comments may also reflect the confidence levels of the team ahead of the mega event while also serving to again temper expectations.The Tigers arrived in Brisbane today after completing a tri-nation series in New Zealand featuring the hosts and Pakistan, which served as their final preparations ahead of the T20 World Cup. The Tigers lost all four matches on that tour.Shakib also expressed satisfaction over the team's preparations for the World Cup.""I think we prepared really well. We were in Christchurch, where we played four games against two very good sides. So, we know the things we need to do to perform well here in Australia. And I think we are prepared enough to do well,"" he said.The Tigers are scheduled to play two warm-up matches against Afghanistan on October 17 and South Africa on October 19 before beginning their World Cup campaign with a Super 12 fixture against the runners-up from Group A on October 24 in Hobart."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/moshari-chilling-narrative-the-reality-women-3144291,‘Moshari’: A chilling narrative on the reality of women,"Spoilers AheadOn Saturday, Nuhash Humayun's horror-short, ""Moshari"", was released worldwide on Vimeo. The movie won multiple awards at the Atlanta Film Festival, Bucheon International Film Festival, Melbourne International Film Festival and Woodstock Film Festival.It was neither the uneasy ambience of shadows and flickering lights, nor the eerie background score that struck me while watching Nuhash Humayun's ""Moshari"". Rather, the hardest blow was realising that the reason I caught onto the underlying representation from the get go was simply because I was a woman—watching the very reality of my existence through a work of horror-fiction.""Moshari"" follows the story of two sisters in a post-apocalyptic world, where bloodthirsty creatures referred to as vampires, haunt the earth after daylight disappears. To stay safe from these creatures that arrive at the slightest scent of blood, one must stay inside a moshari (mosquito net) until the sun comes up. It all seemed like a standard setup for a dystopian world until a particular detail caught my attention.Early on in the film, there is a public announcement that even the first world countries have fallen against these monsters, but Bangladesh is still doing well against them—as most of the population is shown abiding by the regulations.The fact that the male voice behind the announcement takes a particular pride in making this announcement, while also urging everyone to hurriedly coop up inside their moshari before sundown, and that the protagonists are a girl and a young woman seen doing exactly that, immediately rings a bell.""Moshari"" is a chilling commentary about our patriarchal society, that sees it fit to violate women however possible, unless they stay inside like prisoners in their own space and 'cover up'. The monsters themselves are none other than the men, sick with the plague of misogyny, who don't even spare children from their vile actions.The 22-minutes-long film delivers as much in visual metaphors, as it does in symbolic dialogues. Young Ayra's (Nairah Onora Saif) unwillingness to escape to safety as soon as it's dark like everybody else, her curiosity and rebellious nature unveils the heart-breaking unfairness and oppression women undergo.The scene where Ayra sternly tells the monster that he cannot invade her hiding spot, while being unable to breathe because of his presence, is a stark parallel to the violation of personal space and bodily autonomy women face on a daily basis.At first it may seem odd that Sunehra Binte Kamal, who plays Ayra's elder sister, is referred to only as ""Apu"" throughout the entire duration. We never learn so much as her name. However, why would we, as she perishes in the end anyway?After all, our society and system strips down a woman's identity in order to tag her as a mere victim when she falls prey to their own collective failure. Yet another applaudable aspect of ""Moshari"" is that instead of overdoing ostentatious jump-scares, the monsters are shown lurking in the shadows in multiple shots, mostly in frame, in a somewhat intimate normalcy. This strongly establishes how the people they represent are everywhere around us, more often than not inside our own homes.

/business/economy/news/perilla-promising-oilseed-crop-3143641,"Perilla, a promising oilseed crop","Perilla frutescens, an exotic oilseed plant with numerous health benefits, has high export potential as there is considerable global demand for the crop, especially in China, Korea and Japan, according to experts.Some 55 upazilas across Bangladesh have been growing perilla since 2020 thanks to the country's conducive weather and soil conditions.Perilla has different names across the world as it is called shiso in Korea, bhangira in India and bon tulsi in Bangladesh.Moreover, the oilseed plant is richer in omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids that are known to prevent cardiac ailments, making it a good substitute for cod liver oil among vegetarians.Farmers say perilla is a short duration crop that takes less time to grow than mustard plants. Perilla plants mature in just 60 to 70 days while mustard plants take 90 to 100 days.Early August is the best time for planting perilla as it can be harvest by the end of October, after which the land can be used for producing winter and summer crops, they added.A South Korean variety of the herb, called Perilla-1, that is suitable for the country's soil and climate conditions was registered with the Bangladesh Seed Board in January 2020.After it was subsequently released to local farmers, many of them obtained yields beyond their expectations, which helped expand cultivation in the following years.Around 17 hectares across 45 upazilas were brought under perilla cultivation in 2021 while the acreage has since increased to 35 hectares with Dinajpur, Nilphamari, Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, Rajbari and Khulna being the largest producing districts.Syed Rokon Uzzaman, an emerging entrepreneur of Dinajpur's Kaharol upazila, said he intended to cultivate perilla ever since he first heard of it.As such, he rented three acres of land in Tetulia upazila of Panchagarh in 2021 to starting farming the crop.""I got around a tonne of perilla seeds last year,"" Rokon said, adding that production was less than adequate due to unfavourable weather and his lack of experience in growing the crop.An average of about 650 kilogrammes of perilla seed can be produced on each acre of land.This year though, Rokon has leased 12 acres of land in Sultanpur village under Bochaganj upazila of Dinajpur, where he planted the seeds produced last year at a cost of Tk 50,000 per acre.Rokon went on to say that perilla farming is profitable for its high demand in international markets while growers do need to put in as much arduous labour that they would for other crops.""It is cost-effective too as there is less need for fertiliser and pesticides than other plants,"" he said.Rokon's perilla saplings planted in early August started flowering around 15 days back and most of them will be ripe for harvesting by the end of October.The seeds will then be taken out through a conventional threshing method after harvesting.""I contacted a Korean company last year and they were interested to buy a large quantity of perilla seeds,"" Rokon added.Citing how a kilogramme of oil can be extracted from four kilogrammes of perilla oilseed, Rokon urged local investors to build related processing industries in the country.Perilla oil can currently only be found at super shops with prices ranging from Tk 2,200 to Tk 2,700 per litre depending on the country of origin.Other than catering to the domestic demand for edible oil, the crop would have high export potential if the government takes initiatives to ensure its smooth access to the global market.""If I get average production this year, then I could get good profit if the produced seed is exported to targeted countries such as Korea and China,"" Rokon said.Md Abdul Kayum Majumdar, project director of the DAE's Khamarbari office in Dhaka, said farmers in the country are not interested in cultivating generic oilseed plants as those lack profit.""However, perilla could be the best solution for them,"" he added.Majumdar then said that perilla was cultivated in the country on an experimental basis since 2015 until commercial production began in 2020.""It has huge potential of earning foreign currency,"" he said.Majumdar also said that a sample of locally produced perilla oilseed was sent to different countries last year with all recipients, including Korea and China, showing interest to get the oilseed from Bangladesh from this season."

That's not fair.""Dar, who served as Pakistan's finance minister three previous times -- most recently from 2013 to 2017 -- is known as a staunch defender of the rupee.He said Pakistan has not engaged in physical intervention in the currency, which has been battered this year by a strong US dollar, but which has rallied some 10 per cent since his appointment.Dar said that he views the ""true value"" of the rupee at a level under 200 to the dollar. It last traded at 219.""I am for a stable currency; I am for a realistic rate. I am for market-based, but not subject to a currency being taken hostage"" and making speculators billions of dollars.Asked whether he discussed with IMF officials the possibility of borrowing from the Fund's new Resilience and Sustainability Trust for middle-income countries, Dar said ""We have discussed all options.""The Pakistan finance minister added that the IMF's new emergency ""food shock"" borrowing window may also be a good fit for the country, which has lost crops due to devastating floods and may need to import up to half millions of tons of wheat in the next year.""In this scenario, we have the possibility to approaching and accessing this facility,"" he said. "
/star-health/news/laser-hemorrhoid-treatment-novel-safe-and-promising-approach-3143926,"Laser in hemorrhoid treatment: A novel, safe and promising approach","Hemorrhoidal disease is ranked number one among colorectal diseases. Normally there are three hemorrhoid plexus in humans. These plexuses are normal part of the anal canal and have two main functions, they protect the mucosa of anal canal and prevent incontinence by closing the anal canal during rest.When these veins become dilated they turn to a morbid condition called hemorrhoidal disease, which affects more than 80% of the world population at least once in a lifetime. Straining promotes the congestion of these veins and speeds the development of the hemorrhoids; heredity also plays an important role and it is common to observe many cases in a same family. Pregnancy, weightlifting, and anything that increases intra-abdominal pressure contributes to vein dilation.There have been described three types of hemorrhoids, the internal, the external and the mixed. Internal hemorrhoidal disease in general is divided in four grades.Most specialists suggest that hemorrhoid disease grade I and II should be treated initially by conservative means, and operative means should be applied only in case of recurrence or failure to control the symptoms. On the other hand, in grade III to IV the treatment should be operative.The most common procedures during the past 60 years used to be the open hemorrhoid removal and the closed hemorrhoidal dissection that are recognised worldwide.Many methods have focused on curing hemorrhoids including rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, cryosurgery, laser photocoagulation, and stapled hemorrhoidopexy, doppler-guided artery ligation, depending on the severity of the disease.The use of laser began in the 1960s, when the Nd:YAG laser was first used for anorectal surgery. The energy of the Nd-YAG laser can penetrate water and be absorbed by the tissue, inducing a thermal effect which damages the tissue, and then the effect of photocoagulation is achieved.After that, the CO2 laser was used for laser hemorrhoidectomy was performed using a carbon dioxide laser. The method of laser hemorrhoidectomy is similar to the procedure described by Milligan and Morgan except that all dissection and hemostasis is provided by the defocused CO2 laser.The most common techniques for hemorrhoid disease laser treatment are the HeLP technique, the LHP technique and recently the novel LSH technique or ELITE technique.In HeLP technique a Doppler probe is used to identify the main hemorrhoidal vessel and then laser beam energy is applied to thrombose the vessel. Finally, after few days the hemorrhoid pile shrinks as a result of the blood blow stop caused by the external laser energy application.Intrahemorrhoidal laser coagulation or laser haemorrhoidoplasty was first described in 2007 and 2009 is one of the newer innovations in the management of haemorrhoidal disease. The principle of this minimally invasive technique is the coagulation of the haemorrhoidal plexus through the submucosal application of laser energy.Recently the novel LSH technique or ELITE technique uses a special probe, containing a bare fiber within a special conical glass tip, ensuring a gentle application of laser energy.In Bangladesh, many colorectal surgeons practise the use of Laser in the treatment of hemorrhoid. Most of the surgeons apply laser energy on three point (surface, submucosa and intrahemorrhoidal) of a single hemorrhoid, to get an effective outcome and so far the personal experience is satisfactory.The existing data suggest that diode laser is a safe, painless and efficient alternative for the treatment of hemorrhoids, although there are still enough to be clarified. More perspectives, well organised studies with longer follow up are required to demonstrate the exact advantages of these techniques and especially to define the recurrence rate.The writer is a Professor of Surgery at Universal Medical College & Hospital."

/middle-east/news/iran-mighty-tree-cant-be-uprooted-3143871,Iran is a ‘mighty tree’ that can’t be uprooted,"Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that no one should dare think they can uproot the Islamic Republic, in his toughest warning to protesters since Mahsa Amini's death in police custody ignited nationwide unrest now in its fourth week.Demonstrations by people from all walks of life, after the Iranian Kurdish woman's death following her arrest for ""inappropriate attire"", have evolved into widespread calls for the downfall of Khamenei and the Islamic Republic.The protests mark one of the boldest challenges to clerical rule since the 1979 revolution, even if the unrest does not seem close to toppling the system.Khamenei compared the Islamic Republic to an unshakeable tree. ""That seedling is a mighty tree now and no one should dare think they can uproot it,"" he said on state TV.He has accused the country's enemies, including the US and Israel, of fomenting the ""riots"".Rights groups say more than 200 people have been killed in the crackdown, including teenage girls. Amnesty International said at least 23 children have died.Despite Khamenei's stern warning, demonstrators took to streets across Iran again yesterday.Shopkeepers went on strike in Amini's hometown Saqez, in Kurdistan province, and Mahabad in West Azerbaijan, according to the 1500tasvir social media channel that monitors protests and police violations.Youths were also seen demonstrating at universities in Tehran, Isfahan and Kermanshah, in footage widely shared online.The women-led protests have won support from the US president.""I want you to know that we stand with the citizens, the brave women of Iran,"" Joe Biden said late Friday.""It stunned me what it awakened in Iran. It awakened something that I don't think will be quieted for a long, long time,"" he said.The crackdown has drawn international condemnation and sanctions on Iran from Britain, Canada and the United States."
/opinion/editorial/news/another-forest-under-attack-lged-3144031,Another forest under attack by LGED ,"At a time when we should be making serious efforts to increase our forest coverage, which is critically important for our environment and collective well-being, we seem to be doing the opposite. While one would assume that it is private citizens and organisations who are trying to grab our forests, in reality, this is only part of the reality. We have seen over the last few years that it is mostly government agencies trying to implement big projects in our fast-depleting forests. The latest example is the Local Government Engineering Department's plan to construct a road through the Ramu reserve forest, which would connect Ramu upazila with Cox's Bazar City at the Marine Drive along the sea beach. The proposed road, if constructed, will cause irreparable damage to wildlife habitats and elephant corridors, not to mention the thousands of trees that will have to be felled for it. The question is, why then has the LGED department undertaken this project?Reportedly, the LGED's Cox's Bazar office prepared the draft proposal to build the 5km road involving Tk 22 crore at the direction of the Cox's Bazar DC office. The road will facilitate communication between a proposed international football training centre in Ramu and Cox's Bazar City. The government has already handed over 20 acres of the Ramu reserve forest to the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) for building this residential training facility.We would like to point out to the government that construction of both projects (road and training centre) is a breach of our environment conservation laws and Forest Act. Parts of the Ramu reserve forest were declared an Ecologically Critical Area in 1999 under the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995. Building these structures also goes against the government's Conference of the Parties (COP) commitment to end deforestation by 2030.We think the government should immediately abandon these projects considering their potentially far-reaching detrimental effects on the environment. It should also remain careful about any projects that could decrease our forest coverage. The Ramu forest has special significance because it is home to various species of rare plants, birds and wild animals. It is used as a corridor and habitat for the endangered Asian Elephant in Cox's Bazar. The proposed road and other illegal settlements in this forest would only shrink the elephant corridor.Cox's Bazar's forestland has always been a victim of grabbing by various public and private entities. A joint study conducted last year by the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (BELA) and Youth Environment Society found that 45,990 acres of the 260,046-acre forestland in Cox's Bazar have been illegally occupied by 43,568 people and 696 public and private organisations over the last decade. We urge the authorities to take action against these identified grabbers, and make sure that no more of our forestland is lost to human greed."
/business/economy/news/lift-interest-rate-cap-let-monetary-policy-work-3143676,"Lift interest rate cap, let monetary policy work","Deft macroeconomic management over the past three decades has served Bangladesh well. Total export earnings, buoyed by a heady pace of growth in earnings from readymade garments, and foreign remittances, climbed to $ 81.4 billion in FY2022, rising from a mere $5.2 billion in FY1990. Imports boomed that supported rapid growth in GDP, investments, and exports. All this was possible without any pressure on the balance of payments (BoP).The current account was either in surplus or in a small deficit that allowed external debt to grow only moderately while reserves expanded rapidly from $1.1 billion (3 months of imports) to a peak of $48 billion in August 2021 (8 months of FY2021 imports).This comfortable BoP situation has come under pressure since September 2021, which has been accentuated since March 2022 following the Ukraine War and the associated heightening of global inflation. Despite record foreign exchange earnings, the value of imports surged due to global inflation, resulting in a record current account deficit in FY2022 ($18.7 billion). Reserves fell rapidly and short-term debt accumulated. Reserves continued to decline in the first three months of FY2023, notwithstanding import controls. By the end of September 2022, reserves had fallen to $36.5 billion (4.7 months of projected FY2023 imports), an astounding loss of $11.5 billion in a 13-month period. Despite import controls that are threatening to hurt manufacturing growth and exports, there are no signs that the BoP pressure is easing.With a short-term debt growing to $20.7 billion in June 2022 and continued BoP pressure, it is little comfort to see reserves dwindle at such a rapid pace. While the Ukraine war and global inflation are beyond the control of the Bangladesh policy-makers, Bangladesh can't afford to see the BoP situation get out of control. There are no signs that the war or global inflation is going to end very soon.On top, Europe has already entered into a recessionary phase and the US risks falling into one. An extended period of global stagflation could seriously hurt Bangladesh's exports that would be a very unfortunate outcome.Bangladesh does have a good track record of getting out of tight BoP situations as it did in FY2012 by using a judicious mix of foreign exchange, monetary and fiscal policies to reduce aggregate demand, lower the pressure on the exchange rate and stabilise the macroeconomy. So, there is hope this time also policy-makers will rise to the occasion. Unfortunately, however, the macroeconomic management over the past 12 months or so has failed to arrest the deteriorating situation. So far, policy-making has been either ineffective or gone in the wrong direction.The government started well by announcing its intention to free up the exchange rate and protect the reserves. Unfortunately, the policy has remained more on paper. There was an initial correction of the over-valued Bangladesh currency, but its correction course was arrested as the Bangladesh Bank has continued to inject reserves into the exchange market to prevent further depreciation of the taka. Additionally, the BB has adopted three exchange rates: one for exports, one for remittances and one for imports. These multiple currency practices are undermining the earlier BB announcement that it will implement market-based foreign exchange management. The heavy loss of reserves is the price paid by the BB to protect the over-valued exchange rate. This must stop to put the macroeconomy on a sustainable path.Furthermore, the adoption of the 6/9 interest rate policy has severely handicapped the government's ability to reduce the demand pressure on the BoP and domestic inflation. The absurdity of this policy is indicated by the fact that domestic inflation now exceeds 9 per cent, whereas the maximum lending rate has been capped at 9 per cent, indicating that the real lending rate has now become negative. It is obvious that at negative real borrowing rates, there will be excess demand for credit. Indeed, the private sector credit growth has surged in recent months approaching a 14 per cent annualised growth rate in September 2022 as compared with 8.4 per cent in FY 2021. So, instead of cutting credit growth to reduce demand, inflationary pressures have been magnified by credit acceleration, adding to the BoP pressure.The required policy corrections are obvious. The exchange rate must be freed up truly with one uniform rate and no further injection of reserves that are already at a low level.In order to moderate the depreciation of the exchange rate, the BB can intervene through a tightening of domestic credit by letting go of the 6/9 policy. It can monitor the progress of the required correction by using its normal monetary policy instruments such as the bank rate and open market operations.  The opening up of the T-bills to the general public is a positive step that will strengthen the monetary policy. The BB must now move to eliminate the 6/9 policy and let monetary policy work.The author is vice-chairman of Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh.  "
/sports/cricket/news/t20-wc-kicks-today-3143636,T20 WC kicks off today,"Namibia will be looking to continue their rise in world cricket when they lock horns with Sri Lanka in the opening match of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 in Geelong today. The match gets underway at 10:00am Bangladesh time.The first of 45 matches at the tournament will see Round 1 get underway in style, with Group A favourites Sri Lankan taking on a Namibia side who have high hopes of progressing to the Super 12 stage.This won't be the first time that the two sides are going to face off against each other at a major tournament. Namibia and Sri Lanka were placed in the same group in the last T20 World Cup where they also played their opening match of the campaign against each other. The contest didn't give Gerhard Erasmus and his men happy memories as Sri Lanka completely outclassed them -- Namibia were bowled out for 96 and the Lankans chased the target down with seven wickets and more than six overs to spare.But Namibia put on a spirited show in their remaining matches as they won against Ireland and Netherlands to qualify for the Super 12 and also went on to beat Scotland in that phase. The team has grown in confidence and experience since then and it was visible when they put on a clinical show to beat Ireland in the warm-up match ahead of the mega event earlier this week.Sri Lanka, on the other hand, are coming into this tournament with a big reputation to protect as they emerged as the Champions of Asia recently by beating teams like India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh on their way to the Asia Cup title.That win, which featured five consecutive victories, halted a worrying run of form since the last T20 World Cup campaign. Sri Lanka had lost nine out of their first 10 T20Is this year before turning things around completely with that Asia Cup triumph.The Lankans have also carried their newly-found form to Australia, as they delivered an excellent performance in the warm-up match against Zimbabwe. Dasun Shanaka's side won the match by 33 runs as the likes of Kusal Mendis and Wanindu Hasaranga fired with the bat. They will now look to carry this momentum forward to their match against Namibia.Meanwhile, the UAE will be looking to better their record against Netherlands in ICC events when they lock horns in the second match of the day, which will kick off at Kardinia Park in Geelong at 2:00pm Bangladesh time.The UAE will be hoping to deliver a memorable performance as they gear up for only their second appearance in the history of the T20 World Cup. 2014 was the last time they qualified for the mega event and they will be looking to make up for their absence in the last two editions with some eye-catching performances in Australia.The two sides have met eight times in T20 internationals previously, with each team winning an equal number of matches. The Dutch, however, have a better record when it comes to ICC tournaments. Three of their four wins over the UAE have come in either Qualifiers or the World Cup.The Dutch had a disappointing outing in the last edition. They bowed out from the tournament in the group stage itself as they lost all of their three matches. Edwards will be expecting a much better performance from his side this time but the batting needs to step up."
/opinion/editorial/news/fair-statements-cannot-change-the-reality-gaibandha-poll-3144036,'Fair' statements cannot change the reality of Gaibandha by-poll   ,"In perhaps the first known instance of what could potentially be a new trend in Bangladesh elections, a number of presiding officers of the suspended Gaibandha-5 by-poll have alleged that they were forced to give out statements saying it was ""free and fair"", in some cases with the figures of total votes cast mentioned. According to several newspapers, this happened after the Election Commission declared the election suspended, following widespread irregularities and a mass boycott by all but one of the candidates. Although such statements have no legal basis, those could be used to discredit the EC's decision or force it to adopt a lenient approach in subsequent actions.What worries us particularly is the coordinated manner in which the statements – over 50, allegedly – were collected, or the polling booths were infiltrated by outsiders, called ""robbers"" by the CEC. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. What worries us particularly is the coordinated manner in which the statements – over 50, allegedly – were collected, or the polling booths were infiltrated by outsiders, called ""robbers"" by the CEC.This is but the latest proof that serious irregularities did occur in this election – something denied, against evidence, by the local and central Awami League leaderships, and even the local superintendent of police, who should have known better. Justifying its decision on Wednesday, the EC described the irregularities it observed, including illegal presence of men in polling booths, vote rigging, removal of CCTV cameras, etc. In many cases, polling agencies of opposition candidates were forced out of the centres. Now, at least four out of the 16 presiding officers contacted by this newspaper have claimed that they were forced by Awami League men and polling agents to write statements on white papers.Some of them described seeing illegal infiltration of men in secret polling booths. Others described how, after the suspension decision was announced, they were barred from leaving polling centres until they declared the results. They were totally unprotected. In one instance, a UNO asked a presiding officer to write the statement. Clearly, the danger was from both within and outside. What worries us particularly is the coordinated manner in which the statements – over 50, allegedly – were collected, or the polling booths were infiltrated by outsiders, called ""robbers"" by the CEC. Clearly, someone was pulling the strings behind such well-orchestrated moves. Someone was bringing people from outside the constituency to make identification and possible legal action difficult.The statement collection starts to make sense when we consider that Awami League activists organised protests soon after, demanding declaration of results from centres where voting was not halted before suspension. This – and the potential complicity of the Awami League candidate and field-level administrators responsible for law enforcement – must be taken into consideration now that the EC is investigating irregularities. If presiding officers can be threatened or forced to act unlawfully, in their own centres no less, one shudders to think what else unscrupulous political elements can do using their influence.Presiding officers in Gaibandha have created a unique challenge for the EC. They seem to have been both enablers and victims of coercive tactics. At a press conference on Thursday, the EC held them as well as the local administration responsible for the widespread irregularities. It now must ensure proper investigations to get to the bottom of the matter, and punish those responsible."

/star-health/news/call-new-measures-tackle-mental-health-issues-work-3143901,Call for new measures to tackle mental health issues at work,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) have called for concrete actions to address mental health concerns in the working population.An estimated 12 billion workdays are lost annually due to depression and anxiety costing the global economy nearly US$ 1 trillion. Two new publications which aim to address this issue are published recently - WHO Guidelines on mental health at work and a derivative WHO/ILO policy brief.WHO's global guidelines on mental health at work recommend actions to tackle risks to mental health such as heavy workloads, negative behaviours, and other factors that create distress at work. For the first time WHO recommends manager training, to build their capacity to prevent stressful work environments and respond to workers in distress.WHO's World Mental Health Report, published in June 2022, showed that of one billion people living with a mental disorder in 2019, 15% of working-age adults experienced a mental disorder. Work amplifies wider societal issues that negatively affect mental health, including discrimination and inequality. Bullying and psychological violence (also known as ""mobbing"") is a key complaint of workplace harassment that has a negative impact on mental health. Yet discussing or disclosing mental health remains a taboo in work settings globally.The guidelines also recommend better ways to accommodate the needs of workers with mental health conditions, propose interventions that support their return to work and, for those with severe mental health conditions, provide interventions that facilitate entry into paid employment. Importantly, the guidelines call for interventions aimed at the protection of health, humanitarian, and emergency workers.The ILO Occupational Safety and Health Convention (No. 155) and Recommendation (No. 164) provides legal frameworks to protect the health and safety of workers. However, the WHO Mental Health Atlas found that only 35% of countries reported having national programmes for work-related mental health promotion and prevention.COVID-19 triggered a 25% increase in general anxiety and depression worldwide, exposing how unprepared governments were for its impact on mental health, and revealing a chronic global shortage of mental health resources. In 2020, governments worldwide spent an average of just 2% of health budgets on mental health, with lower-middle income countries investing less than 1%."

And just seven days after the end of cricket's showpiece event, the FIFA World Cup will take place in Qatar from November 20.Businesspeople said any World Cup usually triggers excitement among people a couple of months in advance but this year it was a bit different.The sales season for the two sports in Bangladesh normally starts in June but nowadays business has been dull for the fallouts of the pandemic and Russia-Ukraine war which hiked prices of commodities, gas and energy.The purchasing power of people has drastically been reduced while the cost of living has increased amidst raging inflation across the world.Cricket-crazy Bangladeshis became die-hard football supporters ahead of the World Cup, mostly backing either Argentina or Brazil.Cashing in on the zeal, businesspeople do brisk business of related sportswear and merchandise during the season.This gives a big boost to the annual sale of sportswear and merchandise in Bangladesh and gradually it is expanding. According to rough estimates, it has reached anywhere from Tk 1,000 crore to Tk 1,200 crore.The Daily Star spoke to a number of businesspeople recently. Among them, Saiful Islam Bacchu, owner of Khelaghor in Pabna, said sales of kits have not begun in a big way in Pabna as they were selling at best three to four per day.He said in their line of business, sales usually were more centring the football World Cup rather than that of cricket.""Pabna is one of the districts with a lot of sports engagements, where huge excitement around the football World Cup is seen before, during and after a World Cup, resulting in a lot of jerseys along with sports accessories being sold,"" he said.""I have two types of jerseys (based on the quality of the fabric) which are sold in the range of Tk 250-Tk 350,"" he added.Rangolal Talukder, owner of GM Sports in Sylhet city, said sales of kits focusing the international competitions started in the citytwo months ago but it was at a slow pace.""There are 40 sports accessories shops in Sylhet.

We're now selling our existing goods. We will put up new products in the shop soon as sales have not yet gained momentum in Chattogram,"" he said.Shamim Hossain, president of the Bangladesh Sports Goods Merchants Manufacturers and Importers Association, said once there were only a couple of businesses solely centred around Gulistan but now it had spread everywhere.""There are now 250-300 more shops in Gulistan area and around 500 shops across Dhaka, which means the sports accessories market is expanding day by day.

/supplements/world-food-day-2022/news/farm-fork-responsible-way-production-nestle-3143841,Farm to Fork: A responsible way of production by Nestlé,"The largest food and beverage company in the world — Nestlé — has been practicing a sustainable approach to production that is beneficial to the organisation, society, the environment as well as the consumers. With their wide variety of Nestlé products, you probably come across at least one every day. To ensure that these products are of standard quality, compliant, sustainable, and leave as less carbon footprint as possible, Nestlé globally has an impactful approach, ""Farm to Fork"" and Nestlé Bangladesh also opted for the approach for their food products.Whether you are thinking of your morning coffee or snacks for your evening, Nestlé products are available for everyone. With an assuring motto such as ""Good food, Good life,"" it is only logical that Nestlé cares about the standards of their products. Even a few years ago, people were not particularly concerned about the origin or details of the products they consumed. But times have changed. Now, people want to know, what is in their food. How it was produced? Is it affecting the environment negatively? Nestlé not only addresses these questions but also takes another step forward. Previously, Nestlé Bangladesh used to import rice from abroad as required material as per Nestlé stringent quality parameters and specifications were not available in Bangladesh. This left a higher carbon footprint. So, Nestlé took initiatives to meet the challenge. They started a project of 'Connecting farmers for sustainable sourcing of rice, wheat, maize and spice' where hundreds of farmers were trained. These cultivators are now successfully producing rice that meets the high standards of Nestlé and thanks to these farmers, now 100 per cent of Nestlé's rice products are produced locally.Similarly, wheat, maize, and spice products grown locally are slowly making their way into Nestlé through impactful initiatives. This ensures that these products are healthy and meet the stringent standard that Nestlé maintains. The approach to meeting high standards begins in the field. From defining the specifications of raw materials to soil and water testing along with a myriad of other tests carried out regularly, the process of producing quality products is rigorous. With such standards, Nestlé boasts their approach, as they say, 'we unlock the power of food to enhance the quality of life for everyone, today and for generations to come.'  Globally, Nestlé is aiming for zero carbon emissions by 2050. As a part of that global mission, Nestlé Bangladesh attempts to reduce its carbon emission and bring it to zero by 2050 as well. With a lasting impact on agriculture, the aim is to maintain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and provide quality products to the average consumer. For Nestlé, ""Good food, Good life,"" is more than a motto. It is a commitment. Initiatives such as 'On-Shelf Availability' (OSA) and 'On-Shelf Freshness' (OSF) are measures undertaken by Nestlé to ensure that the commitment is met. By focusing on locally produced and responsible sourcing of raw materials, Nestlé Bangladesh can now rely less on imports. This means they can create a supply base that is both dynamic and socially responsible and can achieve cost savings by overcoming quality and food safety issues.   Next time you are at the grocery, think about what type of product you would rather buy. One that is imported and leaves a higher trail of carbon footprint? Or, locally produced quality products those meet all the food and health safety standards and are sustainably produced?There should be no compromise when it comes to food.

Last month Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a mobilisation of 300,000 Russians who had previously done compulsory military service.""On October 15, two citizens of a CIS country committed an act of terror at a training range of the Western military district in the Belgorod region,"" the state news agencies quoted the ministry as saying.""As a result, 11 people were fatally wounded. Another 15 people suffered injuries of varying gravity and were taken to medical facilities.""The two attackers ""were killed in retaliatory fire"", the ministry added.The CIS, or Commonwealth of Independent States, was formed between republics that were part of the Soviet Union.More than 200,000 people have been conscripted into the Russian armed forces since the announcement of partial mobilisation on September 21.The draft announcement sparked protests and several attacks on recruitment offices.Fierce fightingUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile said Saturday that his troops were facing a ""most difficult"" situation near the eastern town of Bakhmut, which has been under attack from the Russian army for weeks.Ukraine is clawing back territory in both the east and south, occupied by Russia for months, but is facing a tough challenge in some areas.""A very severe situation persists in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions"" Zelensky said, referring to two regions Russia says its has annexed.""The most difficult is near Bakhmut, like in previous days.

/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/genocide-1971-us-congressmen-move-give-it-recognition-3143736,Genocide in 1971: US congressmen move to give it recognition,"Two US lawmakers introduced a historic bipartisan resolution at the House of Representatives urging recognition of the genocide committed by the Pakistan Armed Forces against Bangalis in 1971.They called on Congress to condemn the atrocities and Pakistan to apologise to the people of Bangladesh for its role in the genocide, and prosecute, in accordance with international law, any perpetrators who are still living.Republican Congressman Steve Chabot, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and co-chair of the Bangladesh Caucus, and Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna introduced the resolution on Friday.Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque commended the congressmen.Belgium-based International Crimes Strategy Forum's board member Ahmed Ziauddin termed the resolution historic and said it will have practical consequences globally as the US has its own law defining its role once any such resolution is passed.Congressman Steve Chabot said millions of people were killed [in 1971] in what is now Bangladesh and many of them were Hindu.""And it was, in my opinion, a genocide just like other genocides – like the Holocaust – happened. And there were others that have occurred, and this was one that, thus far, hasn't really been declared by definition. And we are working on this now,"" he said in a statement issued by the Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM).""The Bangladesh Genocide of 1971 must not be forgotten… We must not let the years erase the memory of the millions who were massacred. Recognizing the genocide strengthens the historical record, educates our fellow Americans, and lets would-be perpetrators know such crimes will not be tolerated or forgotten,"" said Chabot.The resolution described how the West Pakistani elites deprived the Banglalis of economic, social, and political rights, treating them as a lesser people.It also mentioned General Yahya Khan's order to the top military brass to kill the Bangalis on March 25, 1971.The resolution also mentioned Bangladesh government's estimate that three million people were killed and 200,000 women raped.It sought that the US reaffirms its commitment to promote peace, stability and intercommunal harmony in the Indo-Pacific region, and the right of all people living in the region, regardless of national, racial, ethnic or religious background, to enjoy the benefits of democratic institutions, rule of law, freedom of religion and economic opportunity.Ahmed Ziauddin said the resolution rightly pointed out the historical facts.Aroma Dutta, MP, whose grandfather Dhirendra Nath Datta and uncle Dilip Datta were killed by the Pakistan Armed Forces in 1971, said, she wants the killers to be punished for murdering innocent people, including the elderly, young women, and children.""My family and I have still not recovered from the trauma and suffering. I, along with other family members of the martyrs, demand recognition of this genocide in which millions were raped and killed,"" she said in the statement.HRCBM Executive Director Priya Saha said as a survivor, she hopes that the resolution will initiate a detailed action plan to ensure that the Biden administration holds the Pakistan Army and their Bangladeshi collaborators – the Razakars, Al-Shams, Al-Badr, and Jamaat-e-Islami – accountable."

/supplements/bangladesh-cable-industry-outlook/news/rise-electrical-cable-business-shows-big-export-potential-3143991,Rise of electrical cable business shows big export potential,"Rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and electrification in rural areas of Bangladesh has led to a boom in the country's electrical cable industry over the past few years.Annual turnover in the sector stood at Tk 2,000 crore just a decade ago, when few local manufacturers were involved in making household and industrial cables.However, annual turnover in the electrical cable industry has since reaced Tk 25,000 crore at present, registering 20 per cent growth year-on-year.There are now more than 120 electrical cable manufacturers, of which 20 are big units, 35 are medium and the rest are small, that are capable of catering to the domestic demand.Many of the big units are getting ready to export their cables after serving the local market as they manufacture products of international standard.Some of these companies are already participating in international bidding as the quality of their cables are globally recognised.Md Rafiqul Islam Rony, director of sales at BRB Cables Industries Ltd, said his company has grown a lot over the past few years thanks to growing demand in the sector.BRB's annual turnover has crossed Tk 3,000 crore now with the company producing almost all kinds of cables, both for household and industrial purposes.BRB produces high voltage, optical, submarine, extra high voltage and low voltage cables, Rony added.He went on to say that their business was impacted by the severe fallouts of Covid-19 as the construction of residential and industrial structures slowed down in the pandemic years of 2021-22.But business has since recovered with the improvement of the coronavirus situation with raw material imports from countries like Chile, Korea, Japan and Belgium having been restored, Rony added.BRB, which controls nearly 50 per cent of the total market share, can produce electrical cables worth Tk 7,000 crore each year but much of this capacity remains unutilised.The electrical cable businesses have a bright future in Bangladesh as domestic demand is rising everyday. However, some conditions in the implementation of government development projects are impeding the sector's growth.If the government extends the required facilities and support, then the electrical cable industry could become a very big export sector as well, according to Rony.For instance, if the nearly 37 percent duty being imposed on the the industry's raw material imports is lowered, there would be more investment and production for both the domestic and international markets, he said.Imported electrical cables are being used in various mega projects of the government as per the conditions for their funding.These projects include construction of the Matarbari Power Plant, a third terminal at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, and numerous initiatives of the Bangladesh Power Development Board and Dhaka Electric Supply Company.For example, Bangladesh will have to source the required electrical cables from Japanese companies for any project being financed by Japan as per conditions in the related agreement.As such, foreign companies supply cables worth around Tk 2,500 crore every year even though local companies are capable of providing the same products.Kamruzzaman Kamal, director of marketing at Pran-RFL Group, said rapid urbanisation, electrification and industrial growth in the country has created a good domestic market for electrical cables.""We set up a factory with brand name Bizli at Habiganj in 2014 with the production capacity of 2,000 tonnes of electrical cables a month. We are producing all kinds of cables like fire retardant and also anti termite cables for underground use,"" he added.Kamal, whose company has invested Tk 200 crore in the industry, then said the sector has a lot of potential considering its commendable growth so far.He hopes the business will have a lot of export potential in the future as many companies are either expanding or pouring in fresh investments for setting up new plants to serve both the domestic and foreign markets.Rabiul Alam, chairman of EnergyPac Power Generation, said a new factory under the company will start producting 200 tonnes of electrical cables each month from December this year.Alam said his company is entering the market as the demand for electrical cables has been growing at a fast rate.The government's aim for 100 percent electrification across the country has helped the domestic electrical cable market grow, he added.However, there is uneven competition between local and international companies in the participation of international bidding for mega projects.This is because local companies do not enjoy duty benefits against those contracts for supplying cables to the government while foreign companies do.As a result, foreign companies can easily out bid local ones in the tender process.So, the government should make an even competition for both domestic and international companies for a fair competition, Alam said.Still though, the use of imported electrical cables has fallen significantly due to higher local production. As such, the percentage of imports being used is now only 15 percent for specialised purposes.Ishtiaque Chowdhury, senior executive of brand marketing at RR Kabel, said some unscrupulous traders are damaging the sector's image as they sell non-branded low quality products in the name of good brands.""We, in collaboration with law enforcing agencies, are trying to identify the traders who are involved in trading low-quality cables in this manner,"" he said, adding that both brands and customers are being cheated by such dishonest business practices.Chowdhury also said that RR Kabel, which  produces 600 tonnes of cables per month and holds 10 per cent of the market share, is eligible to start exporting its products.ABM Arshad Hossain, president of the Bangladesh Electrical Cables Manufacturers Association, said the industry has grown fast over the last five years because of the government's 100 per cent electrification initiative.As a result, rural areas have eventually turned into a very big market for electrical cables apart from industrial units.The industrial use of electrical cables has also been increasing at a fast pace not only for the rising number of industrial units, but also because of complexities in the nature of industries.Previously, industries needed normal cables but now they need finer electrical cables due to a change in their nature, Hossain said.In the household category, modern flats and apartments need more electrical cables compared to older buildings. Overall, consumption of electrical cables has increased in the country.In addition, many local industries are expanding production while new investments are coming in big amounts to the country as the demand is increasing, he added."

/middle-east/news/blaze-gunshots-heard-prison-irans-capital-amid-mahsa-amini-protests-3144026,"Blaze, gunshots heard from prison in Iran's capital amid Mahsa Amini protests","A huge fire blazed Saturday at a notorious prison where political prisoners and anti-government activists are kept in the Iranian capital. Online videos and local media reported gunshots, as nationwide protests entered a fifth week.Iran's state-run IRNA reported there were clashes between prisoners in one ward and prison personnel, citing a senior security official. The official said prisoners set fire to a warehouse full of prison uniforms, which caused the blaze. He said the ""rioters"" were separated from the other prisoners to de-escalate the conflict.The official said that the ""situation is completely under control"" and that firefighters were extinguishing the flames. Later, Tehran prosecutor Ali Salehi said that ""peace"" had returned to the prison and that the unrest was not related to the protests which have swept the country for four weeks.Footage of the blaze circulated online. Videos showed shots ringing out as plumes of smoke rose into the sky amid the sound of an alarm. A protest broke out on the street soon after, with many chanting ""Death to the Dictator!"" — a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and burning tires, circulating videos showed.Witnesses said that police blocked roads and highways to Evin prison and that at least three strong explosions were heard coming from the area. Traffic was heavy along major motorways near the prison, which is in the north of the capital, and many people honked to show their solidarity with protests.Riot police were seen riding on motorbikes toward the facility, as were ambulances and fire strucks. Witnesses reported that the internet was blocked in the area.The US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran reported that an ""armed conflict"" broke out within the prison walls. It said shots were first heard in Ward 7 of the prison. This account could not immediately be verified.The prison fire occurred as protesters intensified anti-government demonstrations along main streets and at universities in some cities across Iran on Saturday. Human rights monitors reported hundreds dead, including children, as the movement concluded its fourth week.Demonstrators also chanted ""Down with the Dictator"" on the streets of Ardabil in the country's northwest. Outside of universities in Kermanshah, Rasht and Tehran, students rallied, according to videos on social media. In the city of Sanandaj, a hotspot for demonstrations in the northern Kurdish region, school girls chanted, ""Woman, life, freedom,"" down a central street.The protests erupted after public outrage over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. She was arrested by Iran's morality police in Tehran for violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code. Iran's government insists Amini was not mistreated in police custody, but her family says her body showed bruises and other signs of beating after she was detained.At least 233 protesters have been killed since demonstrations swept Iran on Sept. 17, according to US-based rights monitor HRANA. The group said 32 among the dead were below the age of 18. Earlier, Oslo-based Iran Human Rights estimated 201 people have been killed."
/middle-east/news/40-killed-3143886,Turkey mine blast: 40 killed,"Rescuers yesterday searched for the last miner missing at a coal mine in northern Turkey, where a methane blast the previous day killed at least 40 people in one of the country's worst industrial accidents in years.The blast ripped through the mine near the small coal mining town of Amasra on Turkey's Black Sea coast shortly before sunset on Friday.""We are approaching the end of the rescue operation,"" a tearful Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said at the scene on Saturday.""The search continues for the sole person whose fate is unknown,"" he said, adding that the fire that had broken out in the tunnels following the blast was now mostly under control.Updating the death toll, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said: ""We have counted 40 dead in total. 58 miners were able to be rescued, either by themselves or thanks to rescuers.""He said 28 people had been injured.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed on Twitter that the incident will be thoroughly investigated.Turkey's mining workers' union attributed the blast to a build-up of methane gas.

/news/bangladesh/news/world-food-day-today-inflation-war-eating-away-food-gains-3143626,"Inflation, war eating away food gains","Bangladesh made gains in food production and ensured the availability of rice in recent years. But surging inflation, erratic weather, and the Russia-Ukraine war affected the availability of cereals and reduced low-income people's access to food this year.Today, rice is being sold at near-record high prices.Wheat, the second most consumed cereal in the country, sold for a record price in September amid slumping imports, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).Prices of most vegetables also remain higher this year while eggs, the usual low-cost source of protein, also went out of reach for many.""My two daughters love eggs. Their father used to buy four eggs every day. We can no longer afford that now because of the rising prices of essentials,"" said Tania Akhter, who works at a spinning mill in Taanbazar, Narayanganj.She added that she and her husband, who drives a battery-run three-wheeler, are finding it increasingly hard to make ends meet these days.Food inflation reached 9.08 percent in September after hitting 9.94 percent in August, highest since fiscal year 2012-13, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).Prices of non-food items rose by 9.13 percent in September.""Inflation affects the purchasing capacity of people,"" said Hossain Zillur Rahman, executive chairman of Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC).The low-income people's recovery from loss of earning during the pandemic has been slow, he said, citing a study by the PPRC and Brac.People are being forced to spend less for food because they can't cut the spending on rent, utilities, and healthcare, he said, adding that people were cutting protein off their shopping list and risking malnutrition.Tania said her family ate beef during the Eid in early August. ""We can buy broiler chicken for our daughters only once a month,"" she said.Nurul Islam, a textile mill worker in the capital, said he was dipping into his measly savings amid the squeeze from rising prices.The FAO last week said, ""Domestic prices of wheat flour, locally called atta, continued to increase and reached new record levels in September, over 70 percent above their year-earlier levels. The high domestic prices mostly reflect a slowdown in imports and high transportation costs, due to elevated prices of fuel.""In its September issue of Crop Prospects and Food Situation, the FAO said about 10 lakh Rohingya refugees from Myanmar reside in the country, mainly in Cox's Bazar and on the island of Bhasan Char. Floods in May affected approximately 72 lakh people, causing death, damage and destruction to agricultural infrastructure, as well as losses of livestock and food stocks.In terms of food production and ensuring availability during the pandemic, Bangladesh responded well, Zillur said. ""But climate change is complicating the situation.""Floods, torrential rains and low rainfall affected the cultivation of paddy this year. In July, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) lowered its forecast about rice production in Bangladesh.Heavy rains and flash floods in June damaged crops in the Aush season, which might cause a 24 percent dip in harvest this year.Cultivation of Aman crops suffered due to scanty rainfall, lowest in over 40 years.To increase the supply of rice and contain the prices, the government reduced import tariff and gave permission to 320 private firms to import 13.4 lakh tonnes of rice.The food directorate also signed contracts with India, Vietnam, Myanmar and Thailand to import 530,000 tonnes of rice under state-to-state arrangement.The arrival of imported wheat picked up pace in September, but still remained lower than last year's, according to food ministry data.Professor Shahidur Rashid Bhuiyan, vice chancellor of Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, said the overall availability of food grains was somewhat low at the time.Bangladesh produces a good amount of rice and still has to import almost every year to meet the demand for fragrant rice, make up for the losses resulting from polishing by millers, and to use the grain as feed for livestock and fish.""The availability of carbohydrates in the country is enough,"" he said, citing potato production.When the prices rise, the nutrition of many families gets affected, he said.WHAT FOOD MINISTRY DIDCompared to the same period a year ago, the overall public food distribution under monetised and non-monetised programmes of the food ministry fell by 18 percent to 971,000 tonnes between July 1 and October 6 this year, according to food ministry data.The amount of rice and wheat flour sold at subsidised prices at open market sales points has declined, it added.Ismiel Hossain, secretary at the food ministry, said the government would continue its Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) and Food-Friendly Programme (FFW) to reduce food insecurity of nearly two crore families.The distribution of grains under the FFW increased by 39 percent but distribution under VGF fell between July 1 and October 6 this year, the food ministry data shows.""If necessary, we will import more rice and wheat to run the programmes for the next three months. We will increase procurement from the local sources,"" said the secretary.On October 1, the food department started selling wheat flour at Tk 18 per kg and it would continue the programme to reduce the demand for rice, he said.Benojir Alam, director general of the Department of Agriculture Extension, said, ""We will hopefully achieve our Aman production target of 1.6 crore tonnes,""As of October 12, the food grain stock at government facilities was 16.69 lakh tonnes, 14.74 lakh of which is rice."

Those military activities have continued though at a reduced pace.In a speech opening the ruling Communist Party's 20th party congress in Beijing, Xi said China always ""respected, cared for and benefited"" Taiwan's people and was committed to promoting economic and cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.""Resolving the Taiwan issue is the Chinese people's own business, and it up to the Chinese people to decide,"" he said.""We insist on striving for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and best efforts, but we will never promise to give up the use of force and reserve the option to take all necessary measures.""That option is aimed at ""interference"" by external forces and a ""very small number"" of Taiwan independence supporters rather than the vast majority of the Taiwanese people, Xi said.""The historical wheels of national reunification and national rejuvenation are rolling forward, and the complete reunification of the motherland must be achieved, and it must be achieved!"" to added, to a long round of applause.In her national day speech on Monday, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said war between Taiwan and China was ""absolutely not an option"" and reiterated her willingness to talk to Beijing.China refuses to speak to Tsai, considering her a separatist.Beijing has offered Taiwan a ""one country, two systems"" model of autonomy, the same formula it uses for Hong Kong. But all mainstream Taiwanese political parties have rejected that proposal and it has almost no public support, according to opinion polls."

/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/pearls-your-hair-3144131,Pearls in your hair,"Pearls have replaced diamonds as a girl's best friend. For centuries, these understated jewels have adorned the necks, ears, wrists and fingers of women. Even if visualising a modern spin on pearls is almost unthinkable, as the adornment is practically a classic, in a most creative twist of events, the accessory has now been gorgeously repurposed to embellish the tresses. No, not pearl set pins, those have been around the block already. The newest from these accessories is weaving them directly in your hair!The trend is called a pearl scattering or ""pearlcore,"" as per Pinterest. Whatever the name, the dreamy inlay of smooth, white pearls on hair, especially dark, Asian hair creates the effect of a starry night. Ever since celebrity hairstylist Justine Marjan, who has styled the likes of Kim Kardashian, Kerry Washington, and Olivia Culpo, spearheaded the look with Lucy Boynton, it was heralded as something of a hair movement. Boynton's pearl embellished part at the Oscars red carpet has only moved up the popularity curve, with people adopting the trend and giving it their own, creative spin.The technique is pretty simple, albeit painstaking, as shared by the pioneer of the look, Marjan. Her weapons for the kill — lash glue and tweezers. It's all in the method, she claims. She uses a thin pair of tweezers, and dips it in the smallest amount of glue before carefully placing it on the hair. The glue should dry a little bit, says the stylist so that it is more tacky than gooey. She also recommends cleaning the tweezers after placing each pearl because any residual glue on the equipment could hinder the placement of the ornament, resulting in a gloopy mess.To get the floating effect, she reveals another surprisingly easy trick — use transparent glue for light hair and brown glue for darker shades of hair. As long as the adhesive blends into the hair, the pearl looks neat and effortless.There are plenty of ways one can wear the resplendent baubles in their hair, and they are easy to customise as per quantity and style. Along the hairline, on the crown, woven into braids and everything else in-between, one can play around with styles, sizes, and colours of pearls to create the look they want. The jewels can dress up an otherwise plain ponytail and lend an ethereal touch to boho braids. If one's dress is simple, they serve to elevate the glamour. If the attire is heavy, they demurely complement the ensemble. The style has already showed its magic on the runway and it looks equally mesmerising at proms, and weddings.Truth be told, achieving the trending look does not even warrant a trip to the hairstylist anymore — stick-on pearls are easily available in the market and that makes placing them easy and hassle-free. Not to undermine the beauty of the look in any way, but the relatively simple method of working the ornaments into hair is one of the prominent reasons why the trend has taken off so much.

/business/global-economy/news/eurozone-coming-closer-contraction-3143611,Eurozone coming closer to contraction ,"Uncertainty about Russian energy imports is pushing the eurozone closer towards a contraction in 2023, two senior European Central Bank officials said Friday.""Risks to growth are primarily on the downside, particularly because of the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine,"" ECB president Christine Lagarde said in a statement at an International Monetary Fund meeting.High inflation, weaker global demand and falling confidence were likely to cause ""a significant slowdown"" in euro area growth in the second half of the year and early 2023, she said.In an interview with Lithuanian business weekly Verslo zinios, ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos also saw a darkening outlook.""What we considered as our downside scenario in September is coming closer to the baseline scenario,"" he said.The downside scenario from the ECB's September projections would see the euro area economy shrink by almost one percent next year, while the baseline scenario forecast growth of 0.9 per cent.""The difference between the baseline and downside scenarios lies in the evolution of energy supplies from Russia,"" De Guindos said.""The assumption under the baseline scenario is that 20 per cent of energy deliveries would continue to be supplied, whereas the downside scenario assumes a total cut-off.""Russia has drastically reduced gas supplies to Europe in recent months, in a move seen as retaliation for Western sanctions over Moscow's war in Ukraine.No gas at all has flowed through the crucial Nord Stream 1 pipeline between Russia and the EU's largest economy Germany since late August.The fallout from the war has sent energy prices surging on the continent, pushing already-high inflation to new records.The ECB has joined central banks around the world in hiking interest rates to cool prices and dampen demand, at the risk of triggering an economic downturn.Inflation in the 19-nation eurozone hit a fresh high of 10 per cent in September.De Guindos said if the ECB's bleaker outlook prevailed, annual inflation would climb by 8.4 per cent this year and 6.9 per cent in 2023.ECB governors hold their next monetary policy meeting on October 27, with observers expecting another jumbo rate increase of 0.75 percentage points.""The ECB's governing council expects to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings,"" Lagarde said. "

/life-living/health-fitness/news/the-necessity-regular-moisturising-babies-3144121,The necessity of regular moisturising for babies,"Babies are born with smooth and tender skin; it is a fact that we are all aware of. As much as we envy the baby-soft skin, it is not tough, and must be taken care of regularly to maintain the suppleness.While taking care of our children's delicate skin, we must understand that it is significantly different from adult skin and must be treated with special care. The creams and lotions that we use on adult skin have distinctive ingredients including perfume and other chemicals that may be super sensitive to baby skin. That is why it is essential that we use emulsions that are expressly made for baby skin.A baby's skin is thinner and more delicate than our own and tends to lose moisture quickly. It is also vulnerable to harmful chemicals in the environment. Moisturising helps to seal the skin and act as a natural barrier to harmful ingredients. It also helps to keep the skin healthy and soft.Massages are soothing for babies, and it becomes more effective when it is done with a proper moisturising cream or lotion. However, before a caregiver starts to massage a baby, they must ensure that their nails are short and trimmed, and all sorts of jewellery have been removed. A daily massage, of about 10 to 15 minutes after a warm bath ensures relaxation and tranquillity.'Touch Experiences' are essential for babies because it lets them connect with their caregiver. It allows the establishment of a special bond between the baby and its parents. Massages makes a baby feel more secure, comforted and loved. And things can be taken a few notches up with a massage that's soft, gentle, and moisturising.

The reigning Asia champions lost four wickets for 40 runs inside seven overs and never quite got back in the game despite skipper Dasun Shanaka stitching a 34-run stand with Bhanuka Rajapaksa for the fifth wicket.Namibia played as a unit across all three departments. All their bowlers, except skipper Gerhard Erasmus, grabbed a wicket or two. And earlier in the first innings during their batting, five Namibian batters made significant contributions with the bat -- most notably Jan Frylinck with a 28-ball 44 -- after Shanaka won the toss and sent the African nation in to bat.    The Asia Cup champions were hit by an injury to left-arm quick bowler Dilshan Madushanka and brought in Dushmantha Chameera and Pramod Madushan. Chameera and Madushan were both expensive in their four overs of bowling, having conceded 39 and 37 runs for one and two wickets, respectively.  The wounded Lankans will now look to move on from the shocking defeat as they are scheduled to face UAE, while Namibia will look to ride on the momentum gained from today's victory, and their last T20 World Cup performances, against Netherlands in the team's Group A fixtures on October 18 after UAE take on Netherlands today. The top two teams -- from Group A and B -- are set to qualify for the main round, the Super 12s, and the runner-up from Group A will be slotted in Group 2 in the Super 12s, where Bangladesh find themselves in.   "

It will bring the total of US security assistance since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 24 to more than $17.5 billion.The contents of the latest package, first reported by Reuters, includes high-speed anti-radiation missiles (HARMs) and precision-guided artillery as well as medical supplies, the Defense Department said in a statement.President Joe Biden issued a statement delegating the secretary of state ""to direct the drawdown of up to $725 million in defence articles and services of the Department of Defense, and military education and training"" to aid Ukraine.Moscow has called its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"".A US official told Reuters the aid package was designed to bolster Ukraine's ability to beat back Russia in the counter-offensive that has yielded large territorial gains in recent weeks.Separately, Ukraine expects the United States and Germany to deliver sophisticated anti-aircraft systems this month to help it counter-attacks by Russian missiles and kamikaze drones, Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Friday.Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) allows them to be shipped to Ukraine in the coming days. It allows the United States to transfer defence articles and services from stocks quickly without congressional approval in response to an emergency.This is the second PDA package of the US government's 2023 fiscal year which is functioning under a stop-gap funding measure and allows Biden to tap up to $3.7 billion in surplus weapons for transfer to Ukraine through mid-December.In general, to finance weapons for Ukraine, including the sophisticated anti-aircraft NASAMS systems expected this month, Washington uses funds from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) to procure weapons from industry, rather than pulling them from existing US weapons stocks.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia yesterday announced $400 million in humanitarian aid for Ukraine, the official SPA news agency said, adding that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had made a phone call to President Volodymyr Zelensky.The kingdom has come under growing criticism from Washington after the Saudi-led OPEC group of oil exporters agreed on a drastic production cut with Russia and other allies, which could send energy prices soaring even higher.Washington has accused OPEC+ of aligning itself with Moscow, and on Wednesday, President Joe Biden threatened ""consequences"" for Saudi Arabia.In another development, Iran has once again rejected allegations that it has supplied Russia with weapons ""to be used in the war in Ukraine"", its foreign ministry said.Kyiv and many of its Western allies have accused Moscow of using Iranian-made drones in attacks on Ukraine in recent weeks.

/entertainment/music/news/kabir-suman-bursts-tears-after-reunion-old-bangladeshi-friend-3144066,Kabir Suman bursts into tears after reunion with old Bangladeshi friend,"Renowned singer Kabir Suman deeply mesmerised audiences with his soulful voice and captivating lyrics. Kabir Suman has a profound love for the people of Bangladesh, and was overjoyed that he would be getting to perform again in Bangladesh.The 74-year-old singer came to Bangladesh after 13 long years and fans flocked to the premises of the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh (IEB)—where his concert, 'Kabir Suman Live in Dhaka' was taking place—yesterday, to experience the magic of his voice. Kabir Suman entered the premises wearing a traditional dhuti and kurti. The artiste was instantly welcomed with cheers, claps and a standing ovation. While the noted singer can no longer play his guitar, he entertained the audience by playing the keyboards beautifully. In between performances, Suman was sharing interesting anecdotes of his life. It was during one of these anecdotes that he became rather nostalgic after remembering the tale of an old Bangladeshi friend.A long time ago, West Bengal was in an emergency state. Many accusations had started to pile up against Kabir Suman at the time. As a result, the singer had to escape to Germany, where he ended up working in the Bangla department of a German Radio station.While working there, he met a few Bangladeshi journalists. The memories of those journalists are still clear in Kabir Suman's mind. The singer stated that while some of them have passed away, others are living in different countries. However, one of them is still living in Dhaka and his name is Shahjahan Farooq.After saying his name, Suman went on to say, ""I don't know if Shahjahan Farooq is here…"", but before he could even finish his sentence, a voice from the audience replied, ""I am here…""Kabir Suman was caught off guard. He was unable to believe his own eyes, seeing his long lost friend after such a long time. The singer was seated at that time, but asked crew members to help him stand up so he could embrace his Farooq.At the same time, journalist Shahjahan Farooq was also asked to come up on the stage, where he would be embraced by Suman. Overcome with emotion, Suman's eyes twinkled. It was obvious for those present that he was trying, with great difficulty, to hold back his tears. Eventually, Suman was forced to wipe his eyes with a handkerchief. Looking up after wiping his tears, Suman smiled softly and said, ""Isn't life just beautiful?""This shocking meeting moment between Kabir Suman and Shahjahan Farooq impressed everyone. The entire auditorium burst into applause. Lest one think, it is planned; Suman swears on God, ""I really didn't know Farooq was here."" "
/daily-star-books/news/how-the-picture-dorian-gray-mirrors-the-social-media-age-3144181,How ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’ mirrors the social media age ,"In the dying years of the 19th century, a handful of novels appeared whose characters are familiar all over the world: Dracula, the vampire; Dr Jekyll and his evil second self, Mr Hyde; Sherlock Holmes the detective; and Dorian Gray, the beautiful young man whose picture grows old and ugly in his place. In my third year as an English Literature undergraduate student, I was delighted to see that my professor had included in the syllabus a novel that I had always wanted to read but had not gotten around to—Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). Very quickly, I fell in love with Wilde's beautifully poised, rich, and subtle writing, which contains images that have the rare ability to immerse one fully in the sights, sounds,  and smells of the world being described. Today marks the 168th birth anniversary of this wordsmith. To me, Wilde's novel articulates the deepest anxieties of the late Victorians and continues to offer us ways to interpret our own experiences.Beauty is skin-deep in Dorian's circle of friends. He is welcomed and adored because of his beautiful appearance and even when his sins ruin lives, he always has a certain power because of his attractiveness. Dorian is at his peak when he is unaware of his own beauty, but when conscious of it, his life becomes about surface and appearance. His taste for fashion grows; he loves tapestries and jewels, very flat, decorative objects.The novel revolves around the portrait of Dorian but this is just one of the damaging surfaces that Wilde depicts. Characters' identities and fates are entirely decided by their outward appearance. The owner of Sybil Vane's theatre is reduced to a collection of Jewish features and hideous mannerisms, as is his theatre reduced to its shabby decor. In turn it is all redeemed by the beautiful face of Sybil, who herself is putting on a costume. Veils of societal roles and costumes are worn by everybody in the novel and are made more fatal by the way the characters describe and stereotype each other, never letting each other escape from their narrow identities and appearances. To Lord Henry, who knows all about his sinful behaviour, Dorian remains the beautiful boy that he met in Basil's studio;  appearance always wins out.Having been warned by Lord Henry that his youthful looks will fade, and having seen the supernaturally beautiful portrait that Basil has finished, Dorian becomes overwhelmed by the wish to stay young forever. ""If it were only the other way! If it were I who was always young, and the picture that was to grow old!""he says. His sudden desperation does not fit the innocent, charming image of Dorian we initially see in the novel. Wilde uses this dramatic transformation to show that the threat of mortality can have an extreme effect on people.Dorian is so astonished by the portrait of himself that he becomes jealous of it. Of the fact that it will remain the same while he himself ages and grows less attractive. While this might seem like a strange reaction, it demonstrates the importance of art, surfaces, and appearance to Dorian and the other characters. As the novel shows, this is a dangerous view, as investing too much in appearances leads to the corruption of one's personality.Dorian begins to think morosely about his lost innocence and wishes that he had received punishment for his sins: ""His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery. What was youth at best? A green, unripe time, a time of shallow moods and sickly thoughts."" He resents his youthful beauty itself, associating youth with shallowness. He understands the danger that comes with an unchecked desire for immortality, beauty, and pleasure. He characterises youth as a repulsive state, indicating through the mention of ""green"" and ""sickly thoughts"" that it is even a kind of illness. Indeed, the  problem lies in the obsession with appearances, which are inherently hollow and misleading. Dorian's beauty was a ""mask,"" revealing nothing about his true self, and only terrible consequences have come from living according to ""shallow moods.""The Picture of Dorian Gray is a didactic novel with a clear moral message for its readers. This message stands in contrast to the views of the main didactic character, Lord Henry. Dorian is able to see through Lord Henry's corrupting influence and understand the mistakes he has made, but he cannot survive this realisation; the novel ends with the irony that Dorian's desire for immortality results in his death.There are undoubtedly some facets of modern-day society which are closely tied to the book's themes. Today, glamour magazines and adverts bombard us with Dorian-esque, unrealistic, skin-deep imagery every minute of every day. The novel acutely picks up on one seemingly essential strand of human nature: the lust for our true character to be given a near-perfect, outward-facing mask. This can be seen manifesting itself in everything from celebrity super-injunctions to choosing how you are represented on your Facebook or Instagram profile.Dorian's mythical portrait has become a reality today with social media, but with the opposite effect. We use social media to give the perception of beauty rather than sharing the often marred and messy lifestyles we live; this is not a new phenomenon. Prominent public figures like the Kardashians have only continued the tradition of materialistic excess and manufactured beauty. Seeing other people's perfected, filtered photos often leads us to compare ourselves to them; looking at ourselves and focusing on the features and parts of ourselves that we don't like—as though we are puppets in the performance of a life that we are not fully living. The narcissistic vanity on which Wilde based Dorian's character is still alive and exponentially more powerful. But it wasn't Dorian's portrait that was the dilemma; it was the authority he gave it. Remembering that the perfect version of others we see on social media is not real can help to ground us and break out of the pattern of constantly comparing ourselves to others. One of my takeaways from this novel is that life is beautiful without societally imposed limitations. We are not the perfectly curated profile pictures we post; we're much more dynamic and engaging than that.

Today was the first baby step towards that.""Torino sit 11th on 11 points after collecting just one point from their last five fixtures, in which they have scored twice.They would have leapfrogged Juve with a win but instead are level with Empoli, who earlier ended Monza's three-match winning run with a 1-0 win which came thanks to Nicolas Haas.It was the first loss for Monza coach Raffaele Palladino, who had won his first three matches as Monza coach after replacing Giovanni Stroppa last month.Monza, who were repeatedly denied by Empoli's impressive goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, stay five points above the relegation zone in their first ever season in Serie A."
/business/economy/news/it-exports-cross-half-billion-dollar-mark-3143696,IT exports cross half a billion-dollar mark,"Information technology exports from Bangladesh crossed a major mark in the last fiscal year as local firms and freelancers earned more than half a billion US dollars for the first time from external sources. Local IT companies saw their export earnings shoot up 95 per cent year-on-year to $592.06 million in 2021-2022, according to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).""The export growth was backed by the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector,"" said Wahid Sharif, president of the Bangladesh Association of Contact Center and Outsourcing (BACCO).BPO includes customer service, back-office operations, image processing, graphic design, animation, data entry, accounting and legal process outsourcing, and data analytics.Export of computer data processing and hosting service, which covers most BPO and IT-enabled services, swelled 106 per cent to $484.4 million.Industry people say the growth has been phenomenal since the middle of last year as businesses around the world rebounded thanks to the improvement in the Covid-19 situation.""The revival of economic activities worldwide has helped our firms and freelancers attract more orders,"" said Sharif.According to the EPB, IT consultancy services raked in $38 million in 2021-22, up from $29.67 million a year ago, while software exports rose to $60 million from $51 million in 2020-21.Export earnings of Brain Station 23, one of the top software exporters in Bangladesh, grew 40 to 50 per cent in the last fiscal year.""Orders are flowing in,"" said Raisul Kabir, chief executive officer of Brain Station 23, which hired more than 200 people in the last one year to take its total employees to 670.Apart from traditional software such as payment gateway software, web application and mobile application, the demand for data science-related work is growing tremendously, the entrepreneur said.""Products and services that drive the 4th industrial revolution-centric agenda, including machine learning, are also in great demand.""Export receipts for the installation, maintenance and repair of computers and peripheral equipment increased by around 65 per cent to $9.93 million in 2021-2022.""It is definitely a good sign for our industry and it also indicates the capability of our industry,"" said Rashad Kabir, managing director of Dream71 Bangladesh Ltd, an export-oriented software company.""Due to higher inflation globally, many IT companies, especially from Europe, are going to cut costs and buy services from the countries in Asia.""In September, consumer prices rose 8.2 per cent in the US and 10 per cent in the eurozone.Despite the phenomenal growth, Bangladesh's IT export has remained at a far lower level than those of its peers.For example, India's exports of software services were $156 billion in the last fiscal year, according to The Economic Times.Even Pakistan's earnings from IT exports, including those related to telecommunication, computer and information services, surged 29.26 per cent to $1.94 billion in the July to March period of FY22, reports the Dawn.Syed Almas Kabir, a former president of the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services, however, said the actual export earnings from the IT sector were much higher than the official figures.The estimated annual IT export now stands at $1.3 billion, he said. ""This is because many firms and freelancers don't bring in their full amount.""Industry people also allege that many firms and freelancers fetch their export proceeds through unofficial channels due to the higher rate of the dollar against the taka in the informal market.The taka has lost its value by at least 20 per cent against the American greenback in the last seven months amid US dollar shortages caused by higher import bills amid the Russia-Ukraine war.  Almas also blamed the scarcity of skilled workforce in the sector.""We have more than six lakh freelancers, but their per-hour earnings rate is very low since they mostly do low-value tasks. But Vietnamese and Indian freelancers earn at least three times as much as Bangladeshi freelancers owing to their superior skills.""""We will be able to do more high-value tasks if we can develop IT professionals.""BACCO's Sharif said the changes in curriculum and the collaboration between academia, the government and industry are a must to fill the skill gap.""We have been seeing a scarcity of programmers, especially in the last two years. There is an increased demand for programmers due to the growing demand of software companies,"" said Rashad.""If we can't produce enough skilled programmers, we might lose the export potential.""In Bangladesh, there are about six lakh freelancers and more than 2.5 lakh people are employed in IT firms and the IT sections of businesses, financial organisations and government organisations.Raisul said the growth will be slower this fiscal year compared to FY22.""The coming months will be challenging and high growth will not continue,"" he said, adding that export orders for software, however, will not reduce.""The future is a bit uncertain as the global economy is not in good shape,"" said Sharif."

Eight vehicles of four units of the fire service went to the spot at 11:30 am and brought the fire under control at 12:45pm.Confirming the development, Managing Director of Eastern Refinery Md Lokman told The Daily Star that the injured were taken to Chattogram Medical College Hospital.Factory sources said four people were injured in the incident. However, the refinery authorities said none was seriously injured.Meanwhile, a seven-member investigation committee was formed to probe into the incident, said BPC director (operations and planning) Khalid Ahmed at a press conference yesterday afternoon.In the press conference, Khalid said the fire that broke out in the Eastern Refinery originated far outside the factories. The fire broke out during the welding work of the SPM (Single Point Mooring) pipeline coming from Maheshkhali to the Eastern Refinery during the laying of the pipeline.""At present, we are not facing any problem in production or refining. All operations of the refinery are going on normally... All our units are operational,"" he said."

/news/bangladesh/news/make-reforms-get-45b-loan-imf-3143606,Make reforms to get $4.5b loan: IMF,"The International Monitory Fund has outlined wider reform measures, including bringing discipline to the financial sector and boosting revenue collection, for Bangladesh to avail the $4.5 billion loan.The measures were discussed during a series of meetings between a visiting Bangladesh delegation, led by Bangladesh Bank Governor Abdur Rouf Talukder, and officials of the multilateral lender in Washington DC last week.This was the first discussion between the two sides since Bangladesh made a formal request to the IMF for the loan in July.Talks were held on the measures Bangladesh needs to take in the next three years to get the loan. The conditions of the loan will be discussed in detail and finalised later this month when an IMF team would be visiting Dhaka, said a Bangladeshi official who attended the meetings.""The IMF has verbally agreed to grant the loan. They even told us that Bangladesh could have more than the amount it has asked for,"" the official told The Daily Star, preferring not to be named.He said the IMF officials observed that Bangladesh's economy was not in the worst shape like those of some of its South Asian neighbours.But the lender observed that Bangladesh has to overcome a myriad of challenges for smooth graduation to middle-income status, he said, adding that the IMF asked Bangladesh to reform the banking and revenue sectors.The IMF has once again expressed its disagreement with the Bangladesh Bank's method of calculating foreign exchange reserves, which include the riskier local investment exposure, the official said.Regarding the reform, Governor Abdur Rouf said any reform would be made considering the country's overall socio-economic condition.The Bangladesh delegation had meetings with IMF Deputy Managing Director Antoinette M Sayeh and Rahul Anand, chief of IMF Asia and Pacific Division. The talks took place on the sidelines of the World Bank and IMF's annual meetings, being held from October 10 to 16.Of the $4.5 billion loan, Bangladesh sought $1.5 billion each for balance of payment and budget support and another $1.5 billion from the IMF's newly created Resilience and Sustainability Trust fund. The trust helps countries build resilience to external shocks and ensure sustainable growth.The Bangladesh delegation also met Martin Raiser, World Bank vice president for South Asia, to discuss a $500 million loan for budget support and climate resilient fund.The WB has agreed to give the fund in the next quarter on condition that its suggestions on reforms would be implemented, said the official.The government requested the global lenders to grant it the funds to ease financing constraints and advance the efforts to manage fiscal, monetary and financial stability risks amid the Russia-Ukraine war and climate challenges.The IMF, however, has asked the Bangladesh government to ramp up revenue collection as the tax-GDP ratio remained very low.Tax collection as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product in Bangladesh has been stuck at around 7.6 per cent, the lowest in South Asia and also one of the lowest in the world.To increase revenue, the IMF suggested meeting multipronged targets like simplifying the VAT rate structure, modernising the revenue administration and building compliance risk management capacity through focusing particularly on large taxpayers.The IMF also said that high nonperforming loans in the banking sector, especially in the state-owned banks, remains a major challenge for Bangladesh and it suggested several measures to discipline the sector.Nonperforming loans in the country's banking sector increased 16.38 per cent year-on-year to Tk 103,274 crore in 2021, according to Bangladesh Bank data.As major reform priorities, the IMF suggested Bangladesh strengthen corporate governance, ensure strict supervision and enforcement of the current framework, and reform the legal system to support a stronger enforcement of creditor rights and debtor incentive for repayment.Once the loan agreement between Bangladesh and the multilateral lender is reached, which usually takes a few months, a loan programme will be sent to the IMF executive board. The loan is disbursed after the approval of the programme by the board.Bangladesh's economy was still recovering from the losses of the pandemic in February when the Russia-Ukraine war began. The war disrupted global supply chains and eventually caused inflation in many countries, including Bangladesh.Uncertainties over the forex reserve has also become a major concern for Bangladesh. On August 4, the country's foreign exchange reserve was around $36 billion, down from around $46 billion at the same time last year.Bangladesh is expected to receive more than $3 billion from the World Bank, IMF and other lenders this fiscal year."
/opinion/views/news/the-ecs-main-job-conduct-elections-not-suspend-them-3144266,"The EC’s main job is to conduct elections, not suspend them","For its latest feat, our Election Commission (EC) deserves to be commended on a number of counts. First, for perhaps the first time in Bangladesh's history, the EC stepped up and halted the by-election to Gaibandha-5 constituency amid widespread irregularities. Second, the commission seems to have finally realised its constitutional obligation of ensuring free and fair elections. Finally, it has also exercised its power – power to suspend an ongoing election, to dismiss the results of an election, and to decide that a re-election is required.The EC has provided its justification for why the Gaibandha-5 by-poll was suspended, while the ruling party claims that the EC is biased and that the election was conducted in a free and fair manner.The EC has, in the past, always been indifferent to accusations of electoral irregularities and has always declared elections to have been conducted fairly. However, this time around, the commission has been curiously diligent about ensuring that all polling stations are monitored via CCTV cameras. Whether there are any connections between the EC's determination to prove it is going to ensure corruption-free elections and the ruling party's vehemence in proving the EC is partial against them remains to be seen.However, conversations over the last few days have given way to some crucial questions. Why is the EC so hell-bent on trying to convince us that election irregularities only occur due to law enforcers not fulfilling their duty, while also trying to establish the ""legitimacy"" of electronic voting machines (EVMs)? Why are CCTV cameras being posed as the only solution to ensuring free and fair elections?One of the main reasons for a lack of public trust towards the EC is how adamant the commission has been about using EVMs in elections. It was in late August that the EC declared its decision to use EVMs in up to 150 parliamentary seats in the next general election. And this was done despite major opposition political parties' clear expression of distrust towards the voting machines. It has been widely discussed by opposition party politicians, political experts, and members of the public how fickle a machine an EVM is and how it can easily be manipulated by the EC itself and by those whom the commission has recruited to oversee polling stations. But the EC has paid no heed to these concerns. It has, in turn, only said that EVMs cannot be manipulated by any ""outside"" entities. But the concern that EVMs could be manipulated by presiding officers (PO), besides the fact that the machines are also prone to not recognising the biometric fingerprints of voters, have consistently been dismissed by the EC. Who is to say that the PO who can unlock an EVM using their fingerprint cannot also manipulate the votes? Moreover, there is no Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) when it comes to EVMs. And even if the voting is done digitally, the votes across polling stations and centres will still be accumulated manually.Instead of constructively addressing each of these concerns, the EC has decided to create an ""invisible,"" outside enemy when it is the commission itself whose role in the use of EVMs the people are worried about.The events of the Gaibandha-5 by-poll carry some lessons for us all. This was only a by-poll, wherein a transfer of power is not much of an issue. But even here, a section of people belonging to the ruling party have tried to manipulate the results of the election, even going so far as entering voting booths. So what happens in a year or so, when the parliamentary election will be held, and there will be 300 constituencies across the country to keep safe from such influence and manipulation? Given that it would be the biggest-scale election the country would have, it is only realistic to expect attempts of tampering with its outcome. How will the EC prevent this from happening? Is it trying to imply that it can prevent irregularities by simply installing thousands of CCTV cameras across all the booths in the country? Will they be diligently monitoring all those thousands of voting booths at all times? Is this not highly unrealistic?Bangladesh has so far had 11 general elections, four of which were conducted under an impartial caretaker government and were also largely acceptable to observers here and abroad. And the parties elected during those four elections were also ousted. The remaining seven elections were conducted under ruling parties, two of which were one-sided. Those two cannot really be considered elections at all. An election can never be without contest or competition. The rest of the five elections did not see the existing ruling party be ousted from power and were therefore wrapped in controversy.The Gaibandha-5 by-poll is no outlier, as our own election history tells us that elections conducted under ruling parties can never be free and fair, and are always met with scrutiny.In order to make the next general election an acceptable one, the EC must evolve beyond the use of CCTV cameras. It must be acknowledged that EVMs can be tampered with by those overseeing the polling centres themselves.While it would be difficult for the Election Commission to fulfil its constitutional mandate of ensuring impartial elections, it must exercise its power to suspend elections mired in controversy due to corrupt law enforcers and administrative workers. Now is the time for the EC to emphasise for all parties, especially the ruling party, to help it to conduct free and fair elections. Whether the EC can duly punish the law enforcers, influentials, and other workers who caused irregularities during the Gaibandha-5 by-poll will serve as a crucial test for them.Transcribed and translated by Afia Jahin.

/supplements/bangladesh-cable-industry-outlook/news/quality-cables-key-ensuring-safety-3143996,Quality cables key to ensuring safety,"""The electrical design should be upgraded regularly by professionals after calculating the new load to bring any modification in the building; otherwise, it can cause fire incidents,"" BUET Professor Md Ziaur Rahman Khan
Fires not only claim lives but also destroy property worth hundreds of crores each year and according to the Department of Fire Service and Civil Defence, electrical issues were to blame for 36.82 per cent of such incidents across the country last year. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. 
Electrical issues, namely those stemming from a poor electrical network in buildings, use of low quality cables, outdated power connections with extra load and faulty transmission lines, were to blame for these fires.
LOAD ESTIMATION
The electrical design of a structure is typically carried out in our country by electricians who place less emphasis on safety due to a lack of knowledge. As a result, they usually do not adhere to standard practices, such as setting the capacity at 120 amps when the required load is 100 amps.



""This is a terrible and dangerous practice. After estimating the actual load for the civil structure, we maintain the safety factor two to three times higher,"" said Dr Md Ziaur Rahman Khan, professor of the department of electrical and electronic engineering (EEE) at BUET.
Additionally, people take unauthorised connections, which puts pressure on the main line and causes wires to melt and catch fire due to overload, he added.
 








INFERIOR WIRE QUALITY
Wire quality is crucial for preventing short circuits and excessive heat in electrical network. Since inferior wires are being used ignoring the safety factor, heat is produced even during normal electricity flow.



""This might contribute to setting fires,"" Rahman said.
Even if the material quality is high, there is no price difference between cables with copper or aluminium conductors. Some unscrupulous companies produce and sell low quality electric cables to make bigger profits.
So, customers concerned about costs search for low prices and ultimately purchase low-quality cables, according to A.K.M. Ahasanul Haque, chief operating officer (operation) of Partex Cables Ltd.
Besides, there is no regulating agency in Bangladesh that monitors the standard of electric cables being sold in the market, he said.
Other issues that can start a fire include overloading the system by using inverter goods, poor connections at junctions and low-quality electrical products, including extension cables, circuit breakers, switches, and switchboards.
REPURPOSING THE STRUCTURE
Without following the proper guidelines, many old residential structures are repurposed as factories in Bangladesh.
""Such negligence can result in catastrophic consequences. Thus, the electrical design should be upgraded regularly by professionals after calculating the new load to bring any modification in the building; otherwise, it can cause fire incidents,"" said BUET Professor Rahman.
Prioritising the garment industry, he mentioned that the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments (DIFE) under the Ministry of Labour and Employment would gradually start working on other sectors to ensure electrical safety.
A HUGE DRAWBACK IN THE SYSTEM
The Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC) and the Electricity Act 2018 cover standards for electrical wiring design, equipment installation in buildings, and penalties.
However, the BNBC's recommended electrical design is not adequately executed since the electrical engineer's function in the building approval procedure is overlooked, said Dr Md Aynal Haque, professor and dean of the EEE department at BUET.
Building approval requires the signatures of an architectural engineer and a structural engineer but not an electrical engineer, which is a serious flaw.
So, a provision for an electrical engineer's signature should be included to ensure accountability and responsibility among every stakeholder, added Haque, who is also president of the Electrical Safety Forum Bangladesh (ESFB).
HOW TO ENSURE PROTECTION
Experts also stressed on the importance of raising public awareness on electrical safety and providing training to technical manpower working at field level.
""Electrical safety issues are yet to go mainstream like structural issues in our country. People should be aware of electrical safety related to standard practices and get encouraged to follow them,"" said Professor Rahman.
""To eliminate the scarcity of technical manpower, we should concentrate on providing them with appropriate training,"" he added.
Although power lines at houses and businesses are supposed to be examined by specialists every three months, the rule is never followed, said Mohammad Manikuzzaman, assistant director of the Department of Fire Services and Civil Defense.
To minimise the fire incidents due to electrical issues, the use of quality flame retardant (FR) cables must be ensured in building wiring, power cable substations and other distribution lines. FR cables prevent the spread of fire even if a spark occurs due to a short circuit. The fire is put out within one metre as a standard factor of the cable.
Besides assuring the use of FR cables in electrical networks, the quality of the cable must be ensured otherwise the required protection will not be obtained.

/opinion/views/news/why-are-political-parties-trying-woo-the-prince-calcutta-3144191,Why are political parties trying to woo the Prince of Calcutta?,"When former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly exits as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) after a three-year tenure leaving behind a mixed track record, the last thing one should expect is that he will cease to be in media focus. No. That is just not going to happen. And Sourav himself has made that amply clear.Between October 13 and 15, the 50-year-old former cricketer made two remarks which are a clear pointer to his future plans. First, he said not remaining BCCI chief is not the end of the road for him and secondly, he said he would contest for the post of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president. As BCCI president, he had the entire country's cricket administration and interaction with international cricket organisations as his mandate. As CAB president, his area of activities will be much smaller but familiar because he had held that post for four years earlier.Sourav's stints as cricket administrator in Bengal and BCCI have ensured he remains in the media focus and consequently the public domain. And controversies and media speculations have only added spices to that. The media in India has come up with all sorts of theories without any authenticity as it groped in the dark to understand why Sourav did not get an extension as BCCI chief. But none asked the question: is there a sense of entitlement in either getting or not getting an extension?Sourav's stint as an administrator has had its own share of setbacks – uncertainty over the Indian Premier League (IPL) due to Covid-19, lack of firming up of India's domestic cricket structure and departure of a few sulking players from Bengal to other states including wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha looking for greener pastures.On and off the field, Sourav always had a set of admirers as a player and cricket administrator. But as an administrator, he also has his critics. Some of his former colleagues in the national team rate him highly for grooming and backing them to the hilt even in the toughest phases of their cricketing careers.In normal course, Sourav's exit would have passed off as a routine event. But what has made it non-routine is the questions why he did not get a second shot as BCCI president after his first tenure came to an end even though there was no legal bar. What had raised the expectations of Sourav supporters was that in September this year, the Supreme Court allowed a person to have two consecutive tenures as president and secretary, overturning to a considerable extent the 2018 recommendations of a judicial commission. Ironically, many had thought the apex court ruling would facilitate a fresh stint of Sourav as BCCI president.The question agitating a section of the pro-Sourav media as well as the public is while he did not get an extension, BCCI Secretary Jay Shah, son of senior BJP leader and Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, got it. The comparison would not have found traction had it been anyone other than Jay. This has not only polarised the Indian media but also entered the political minefield in West Bengal where the BJP has been accused by ruling Trinamool Congress and opposition Congress and CPI(M) of ""humiliating"" the popular ""Prince of Calcutta"". The common refrain of TMC, Congress and CPI(M) is that the BJP is cut up with Sourav after failing to make him join the saffron party. TMC spokesman Kunal Ghosh claimed that it is an example of ""political vendetta"" that Amit Shah's son would continue as BCCI secretary, but not Sourav as its president.However, Ghosh was evasive when asked about his comments on Sourav hosting Amit Shah and other BJP leaders to a dinner at his south Kolkata residence in May this year. That event had no doubt left TMC squirming for a response.Sourav, for his part, has so far done a delicate balancing act when it comes to politics. If he hosted Shah to a dinner, the very next day he also shared dais with TMC leaders, including Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Mayor Firhad Hakim, at separate public events. He has so far refrained from joining any political party. Now that he is going to be out of the BCCI, will he exercise his political options? When Sourav had become CAB president for the first time in September 2015 following the death of Jagmohan Dalmiya, it was thought he had the backing of Mamata who however went on record to reject any suggestion of interference in a sporting body. It remains to be seen how the coming CAB presidential race pans out.The question is: why would political parties fall over each other to woo Sourav who has no standing as a political heavyweight and is not known for articulation or giving fiery speeches. Given his popularity as a cricketer, Sourav's only value addition could be to the electoral plank of Bengali sub-nationalism which TMC had used so successfully in 2021. It is a different matter that TMC had later tried to live down a bit of that sub-nationalism post-Bengal assembly poll by inducting a number of non-Bengali politicians from other states as it had unsuccessfully tried to be a national party by contesting assembly elections in Goa, and prior to that, in Tripura municipal polls. It certainly did not help TMC which put up a disastrous show in Goa and Tripura.True, Mamata herself is TMC's biggest vote-catcher in Bengal. But the party has built up a formidable grassroot machinery and mobilisation across the state, which BJP cannot match. On the other hand, BJP's main electoral mascot is Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is in this perspective that one has to see Sourav's relevance in Bengal politics and how much value addition he can bring to any party he decides to join. For BJP, the induction of Sourav cannot make up for its lack of adequate ground-level presence in Bengal to counter TMC. Sourav must carefully assess his political relevance, if any.Pallab Bhattacharya is a special correspondent for The Daily Star. He writes from New Delhi, India."
/entertainment/tv-film/news/rubeus-hagrid-remembering-the-gentle-giant-who-stole-our-hearts-3144246,Rubeus Hagrid: Remembering the gentle giant who stole our hearts,"My first exposure to the Harry Potter series was through the movies, eventually leading to me reading the books. Since then, I've been eagerly waiting for my letter from Hogwarts.Even with all the magical adventures, classes, quidditch matches, broomsticks, and wands, one character that really stood out for me was the half-giant, half-wizard Hagrid.The night Harry discovers he's a wizard is almost portrayed like a horror film in the first Harry Potter movie. To avoid the letters warning him of his magic, his uncle takes Harry, along with the rest of the obnoxious Dursleys to a cabin on a distant island.Nevertheless, Hagrid shows up in person to deliver Harry's letter to Hogwarts, busting down the door after the Dursleys refuse to let him in. Even though his initial silhouette frightens everyone including Harry, as soon as he speaks, Harry realises that Hagrid is a friendly visitor and not a terrifying monster.The Scottish actor, Robbie Coltrane, the man behind the loveable giant passed away on Friday at the age of 72. For a generation of Potterheads, Coltrane was best known for his eight-film-run as Hagrid. The character, as he appeared in the book, was a bumbling, whimsical, and devoted ally to Harry and his friends.Coltrane, who was already six-feet-tall, had to wear a padded jacket and use extremely small props and sets to get into the character of the giant and really tower over his co-stars. However, being Hagrid was more than just a physical challenge for the actor. Over the course of a decade, Coltrane gave the character a depth and humanity that helped him become not just instantly recognisable, but also real. And he did all of this while gently resisting the script's tendency to make the character into one used for comic relief.In an interview, Coltrane revealed that he had read the books to his children, which is how he came to know and adore them. ""If you're an actor, you have to do the voices. The children expect it. No monotones allowed,"" he had joked.In the books, Hagrid was a peculiar adult, who fit in more with Harry and his friends—who would frequently visit him for tea and conversations—which is somewhat ironic given that he is a giant. Hagrid was the groundskeeper of Hogwarts, after being expelled from the magical school as a young man, resulting in him being somewhat childish. He's the kind of eccentric personality who names a submissive bloodhound ""Fang"", while naming a fearsome three-headed dog ""Fluffy"".However, his love for animals and magical creatures is truly what makes him the 'gentle giant', as he can be seen caring for man-eating spiders and dangerous dragons with the utmost care.The movies stayed mostly true to Hagrid's narrative, but they frequently made fun of and gawked at his character. In the first film, Hagrid gives Harry a birthday cake, with the icing misspelled as 'Happee Birthdae', a needless insult to his intelligence given that it was never done in the books. In the fourth movie, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", Hagrid accidentally stabs a co-worker in the hand with a fork due to his attraction to a romantic interest, this pretty severe example of his ungainliness wasn't in the text either. Characters frequently gave Hagrid the silent treatment when he spoke, rolling their eyes or making faces at him as if he were stupid, all of which feels rather unfair.Coltrane, however, avoided adopting a caricature-like approach when portraying Hagrid. Instead, he used the character's backstory—like that fact that he was tormented by his Hogwarts peers, abandoned by his giantess mother, and desperately trying to hide his genetic heritage—to help audiences connect with Hagrid.Even at his most ridiculous moments, Hagrid had a hopefulness and a tenderness that portrayed the character's difficult past. The actor seemed to comprehend Hagrid's struggles that gave him a fortitude that didn't turn into bitterness, but rather into a genuine capacity to accept characters like Harry, Ron, and Hermione—those who also struggled to fit in with the rest of the school.Consider the scene where Hagrid introduces the trio to his half-brother, the enormous Grawp. The dialogue calls for Hagrid to be emphatic about their assistance, as he needs the trio to keep Grawp company while he's away. He explains, ""He's completely harmless, just like I said,"" he explains, ""though high-spirited is all… You will look after him, won't you?""Coltrane spoke these words softly rather than firmly—almost fighting back tears—helping the audience understand that Hagrid is feeling guilty and desperate about the request.Aside from the second movie, Hagrid was rarely the centre of attention, but his sympathy for the heroes kept the story's heart alive, and Coltrane saw the potential in his character right away. In an interview for the franchise's 20th-anniversary special, the actor compared Hagrid to Superman.""Everybody in the world would like a really big, huge, strong, good man on their side, simple as that. That's the attraction of Superman and these things,"" he said. ""You wish there were a power for good in the world that was irresistible to the bad guys. And Hagrid was always obviously the good guy, wasn't he?""An emotional Coltrane also said in that special, ""The legacy of the movies is that my children's generation will show them to their children. So, you could be watching it in 50 years' time, easy. I'll not be here, sadly, but Hagrid will, yes.""Even though Coltrane is no more, his iconic role of Hagrid will live on in the films. Even those who read the book, and have also seen the films, will usually visualise the Scottish actor when thinking about the gentle giant."
