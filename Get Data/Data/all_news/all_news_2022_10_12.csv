We will conduct the election with the voter list. We will not worry about NID,"" he added.Currently, NID-related services are being provided under the EC, which has developed the NID database containing information on over 100 million citizens aged above 18.The NID services include issuing secure national identity cards to citizens, administering all related activities, including maintaining a national citizen registration database and delivering identity verification services to qualified public and private organisations."

/news/world/usa/news/imf-cuts-2023-global-growth-outlook-3140331,IMF cuts 2023 global growth outlook,"Global growth is expected to slow further next year, the IMF said yesterday, downgrading its forecasts as countries grapple with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, spiralling cost of living and economic downturns.The world economy has been dealt multiple blows, with war in Ukraine driving up food and energy prices following the coronavirus outbreak while soaring costs and rising interest rates threaten to reverberate around the globe.""This year's shocks will re-open economic wounds that were only partially healed post-pandemic,"" said International Monetary Fund economic counsellor Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas in a blog post accompanying the fund's latest World Economic Outlook.More than a third of the global economy is headed for contraction this year or next, and the three biggest economies –- the United States, European Union and China –- will continue to stall, he warned.""The worst is yet to come and, for many people 2023 will feel like a recession,"" said Gourinchas.In its report, the IMF trimmed its 2023 global GDP forecast to 2.7 percent, 0.2 points down from July expectations. Its world growth forecast for this year remains unchanged at 3.2 percent.The global growth profile is its ""weakest"" since 2001, apart from during the global financial crisis and the worst of the pandemic, said the IMF.This reflects slowdowns for the biggest economies, including a US GDP contraction in the first half of 2022 and virus lockdowns in China on top of a property market crisis.A key factor behind the slowdown is a shift in policy as central banks try to bring down soaring inflation, with higher interest rates starting to take the heat out of domestic demand.Growing price pressures are the most immediate threat to prosperity, said Gourinchas in the report, adding that central banks are now ""laser-focused on restoring price stability"".Global inflation is expected to peak at 9.5 percent this year before dropping to 4.1 percent by 2024.But misjudging the persistence of inflation could prove detrimental to future macroeconomic stability, he warned, ""by gravely undermining the hard-won credibility of central banks.""While current challenges do not mean a large downturn is inevitable, the fund also warned many low-income countries are either in, or close to debt distress.Progress toward debt restructurings for the hardest-hit is needed to avoid a wave of sovereign debt crisis. ""Time may soon be running out,"" said Gourinchas.The IMF has cut forecasts for the two biggest economies, United States and China, as well.US economic growth is pegged at 1.6 percent this year, 0.7 points below the fund's July forecast, due to an unexpected contraction this year.""Declining real disposable income continues to eat into consumer demand, and higher interest rates are taking an important toll on spending,"" the IMF said.The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates aggressively to tamp down surging inflation, which is slowing economic activity. And the central bank has said more increases are likely to come.A slowdown in the Euro area is expected to deepen next year, said the IMF, and growth in China is projected to hit its lowest rate in decades -- apart from during the initial coronavirus outbreak.China's economy is expected to grow 3.2 percent this year, slightly lower than originally forecast.The fund cautioned that a worsening of China's property sector slump could spill over to the domestic banking sector and weigh heavily on growth."

/sports/news/further-experiments-store-3140606,Further experiments in store?,"Sridharan Sriram, Bangladesh men's T20 cricket team's technical consultant, pointed to experiments being part and parcel as the team approaches the World Cup despite stating the core of the team for the mega event is established. Sriram also mentioned that all efforts will be extended to Shakib Al Hasan to ensure it becomes 'his team', galvanised by the skipper's ability to keep the environment calm.As Bangladesh take on New Zealand today in Christchurch, they do so while knowing that a defeat would throw them out of contention for a spot in the final. Both Pakistan and New Zealand have two wins while the Tigers, who have lost both their games so far, have two more matches to go.Shakib, who missed the first match of the tournament, having been rested due to fatigue, will have to pull up his socks to get his team's confidence up before the upcoming assignments. Members of the Bangladesh team huddled around their skipper yesterday at Lincoln as Shakib tried to instil messages on a plan of action.Bangladesh have, so far, failed in their experiments with make-shift openers from both ends as Sabbir Rahman was dropped and Najmul Hossain Shanto took his place in the playing eleven during the last match on October 9 against New Zealand. Using make-shift openers is not unheard of but the profiles being used as openers did not bear fruit from a tactical sense and Sriram opined more experiments will be made. It is at the top where Bangladesh have failed to grasp the tempo which saw them struggle to cope, and it remains to be seen if the management decides on keeping Mehedi Hasan Miraz as opener.Sriram found plenty of positives so far and wanted to keep learning about the players' ability to carry out different roles.""I think we want to keep experimenting by giving people different roles and different challenges. We keep learning about them. There has been a lot of improvement shown. The middle-order has shown a lot of improvement.""Middle-order with Shakib coming back becomes very strong. Afif [Hossain], Liton [Das], once they get going, we will have a very formidable batting line-up,"" he added.Why Shakib has chosen to come down the order remains unclear but there is a need to find solidity at the top. It will be interesting to see whether the skipper now comes further up the order to be able to dictate the innings better.Sriram mentioned that it is in fact Shakib's team and the skipper has 'clear plans' on how to get into the right mould ahead of the World Cup. From that point of view, even if Bangladesh do not make the final, they have the scope to improve on their plans and Shakib holds the key to what the team can offer.""Shakib is very calm. In international cricket we are bound to have ups and lows. I think we got to get steady through the ups and lows. Shakib has been brilliantly keeping this environment. He is taking the boys out, he is always chatting with them. He has very clear plans on how he wants to take his team forward. He has all our support. We just want him to let him run the team. It's his team and we will support him from all ends,"" Sriram said.""We got the core squad that is really going to do well in the future and we look forward to the World Cup,"" he added as the team still looks for a firm footing in the T20I format."
/opinion/views/the-shores-injustice/news/robbed-wages-stolen-livelihoods-3141126,"Robbed wages, stolen livelihoods","""We go overseas to earn, but our money is being stolen. We need to do something about this."" – Bijaya Sreshtha, Nepali returnee migrant worker and activist""We need a break from the cycle of exploitation (of wage theft) and the silence associated with it."" – Kortornilo Farny, Thai migrant activist""Wage is the property of workers; we need to create a system for them to reclaim their unpaid dues.""– Sister Lizzy, Indian activistThese statements were made at a conference on access to justice for migrant workers held in Kuala Lumpur on October 2-4. The event was convened by Migrant Forum in Asia to take stock of the Wage Theft campaign. Launched in June 2020 by a large coalition of civil society organisations and trade unions in the Asian region, the Wage Theft campaign aims ""to establish an 'Urgent Justice Mechanism' in addressing the plight of millions of migrant workers whose wages have been unjustly withheld by their employers."" Wage theft is the total or partial non-payment of a worker's remuneration, earned through the provision of labour services, as stipulated in a written or non-written employment contract. It also includes payment below the minimum wage, non-payment of overtime, non-payment of contractually owed benefits, non-negotiated reduction of salaries, and retention of dues upon one's contract termination. However, the phenomenon of wage theft is not restricted to these indicators only. Deduction from wages under the pretext of insurance, medical examination, transport costs, skills training and the like is quite common as well. In many instances, workers are promised higher wages but are made to sign a second set of documents upon arrival in the destination countries, often in languages that migrants do not understand. This subjects them to be contractually paid less than what was promised to them. Unauthorised deduction of wages in the guise of imposing penalty to the workers is also common. In many instances, the quality of food and the standard of accommodation are not commensurate with the amount that is deducted from their wages. All these amount to wage theft.One of the major forms of wage exploitation takes place when domestic workers are made to work for long hours (without being paid overtime) and also made to work for the relatives or friends of the employers. Instances are replete when workers are brought under the visit visa and denied wages even though they are made to work during that period. There have been cases when employers or agents paid less than the due wages when they transferred the payment directly to the relatives of the workers in their origin countries. The long drawn stagnancy in basic salary is a major factor for migrants receiving meagre end-service benefits as the package in most cases is tied to the basic salary received. Cases are also rampant in which employers illegally deduct the amount they pay to recruitment agencies to procure workers, from their wages. Often, the amount might be equivalent to three to four months' wages of a worker. The increasing engagement of mega-employment companies that supply migrant workers to third-party employers, often big companies, and government agencies in the destination countries has become a major source of wage exploitation. Huge segments of workers' wages (allegedly up to 50 percent in cases) are usurped by these mega-companies that essentially work as labour contractors, while companies that benefit from the services of these workers refuse to take any responsibility for that. The false promise of remitting unpaid wages made by the employers after a worker leaves the country of employment is yet another form of wage theft. When Covid 19 was at peak, millions of migrant workers were robbed off their unpaid wages and entitlements. The countries of destination have thus far not taken any initiative to make their employers pay due wages to the deprived workers – neither has it been an issue of concern for the countries of origin. Instances are not uncommon where employers hold the travel and identity documents of the workers and force them to continue to work even after the end of the contract period. These workers have little option but to comply as they are threatened that their arrear wages and end-service benefits will not be cleared if they do not comply. Under such circumstances, with their status becoming irregular, they become virtually bonded to their employers. Likewise, workers are often subjected to forced return before the expiration of their contracts. This enables their employers not to pay their end-service benefits and return travel costs.Migrant workers are not spared of being robbed of their wages and due entitlements even after their death. The claims of ""natural causes"" of deaths are often far from the truth. The use of the term ""natural cause"" frees the employers from paying compensations for workplace accidents and other responsibilities, and there is little scope for the deceased migrants' families to lodge claims and complaints. The prohibitive legal costs associated with lodging such complaints or claims act as a huge deterrence. Imposing taxes on the compensations is yet another form of wage theft for workers and their families. What migrant workers experienced during the peak of Covid-19 across the globe has shed light on this largely ignored plight of the vulnerable workforce. In their fixation to harness remittances, the origin countries did not show much interest in their migrant workforce's lack of access to justice in the destination countries. Surely, they would be interested in the issue if someone could work out the potential increase in the volume of remittances – given the workers were not deprived of their due wages. As Prof Binod Khadria of Jawaharlal Nehru University argued, the damage done due to wage theft is not limited to the migrant workers, but the nation as a whole. ""Wage theft is an assault on the concerned country's GDP,"" he observed. Lauding the launch of the Wage Theft campaign, the World Bank economist and remittance expert Dilip Ratha stated that if portable pensions and social security benefits can be worked out between states, the international community should talk about access to portable justice. Further reinforcing the argument, Ragunath Kesavan of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia observed that if national courts can adapt to changed circumstances and make room for virtual hearing for commercial cases, employment matters could be taken up by them. Highlighting the severe limitations of the current system, William Gois of Migrant Forum in Asia said in most jurisdictions, migrants lose their residency as soon as their jobs are terminated. How can one pursue their case when they are not allowed to stay, and in the rare cases that they are, they do not have the permission to work? Likewise, while lodging complaints may be free of charge in some jurisdictions, preparing documents for cases requires a lawyer's service, which is expensive. The reticence of employers to be present at the court or honour its decisions and the inability of the court to execute its decisions are the gaping holes in the existing system, Gois noted. Pablo Ceriani of the UN Committee on Migrant Workers called for building firewalls to ensure that workers are protected under the labour law independent of their immigration status. Ryszard Cholewinski of the International Labour Organization (ILO) underscored the need for setting up fast-track alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for small claims, and protection for complainants and whistleblowers against retaliation. Covid-19 has exposed the acute vulnerability of Asian migrant workers, particularly their lack of access to justice in destination countries. The power imbalance between the employers and the workers, and the absence of an enabling environment of freedom of association and the right to organise, reinforced by indifference of the authorities of both the countries of origin and destination, have created a situation of systemic injustice. It is time the states took meaningful measures to protect the goose that lays the golden eggs. Dr CR Abrar is an academic and human rights expert.

/news/bangladesh/news/tk-898cr-project-okayed-revive-4-dhaka-canals-3140516,Tk 898cr project okayed to revive 4 Dhaka canals,"The government has approved  a project to revive four canals of  Dhaka to reduce the capital's waterlogging woes.The Tk 898.73-crore project was okayed by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council meeting yesterday,  chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.The canals are Kalunagar, Jirani, Manda and Shyampur under Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC). Total length of the canals is 19.78 km, of which, Kalanagar is 2.4 km, Jirani is 3.9 km, Manda is  8.7 km and Shyampur 4.78 km.The canals will be freed from encroachers and pollution, according to the project insiders.Besides, 38.06 km of boundary walls, 36 pedestrian bridges, 19 bridges for vehicular movement, 10 public toilets, 32.44 km walkways, four plazas, bicycle lanes and 771 lights will also be set up as part of the project.The project was sent to the planning commission in September 2021 and is scheduled to be completed within December 2024.Planning Minister MA Mannan at a press briefing after the meeting said  these canals are polluted and buildings were constructed over them.Saying the canals will be recovered and cleaned, the minister added, ""We approved this project on a priority basis. The DSCC mayor will have to implement it.""A feasibility study of the project has already been carried out, he added.Echoing the same, Md Mamun Al Rashdi, secretary of planning division, said the prime minister stressed the importance of canals at the meeting.Khairul Baker, DSCC engineer and project coordinator, said all groundwork has been completed and works will start upon receiving  a written notice of the Ecnec approval.He said they will recover the canals from encroachers and also carry out a cleaning and excavation programme.DSCC and Dhaka North City Corporation formally took over the  responsibilities of 26 canals and 10 kilometres of box culverts from Dhaka Wasa  on December 31, 2020, aiming to reduce waterlogging.Of them, DSCC took charge of 11 canals.Few months after this development, DSCC Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh told The Daily Star that they have taken short-, mid- and long-term plans for reviving the waterbodies.""We will initially revive four canals under our long-term plan -- Manda, Kalunagar, Jirani and Syampur -- which play a vital role in the city's drainage system,"" he said.Apart from the canal project, Ecnec also approved a Tk 122.03-crore project titled ""Improving the Reliability and Safety on National Highways Corridors of Bangladesh by Introduction of Intelligent Transport System""."
/sports/cricket/news/tigers-opt-bowl-must-win-game-against-new-zealand-3140641,Soumya returns as Tigers bowl in must-win game against NZ,"Bangladesh have won the toss and elected to field in their must-win game against New Zealand in the ongoing T20I Tri-nation series at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Wednesday.  The Tigers made three changes to the eleven that played in their last game, against New Zealand, in the T20I Tri-nation series. Soumya Sarkar, who was dropped from the squad following poor performances in the last edition of the T20 World Cup last year, returns as he is set to feature in Bangladesh colours after over 11 months. The last time the left-handed opener played a game for Bangladesh was in November 2021 in a Super 12 encounter against Australia in the 2021 T20 World Cup in Dubai.  Mohammad Saifuddin and Ebadot Hossain are the two other changes in the eleven. Pacers Taskin Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud and all-rounder Mehedi Hasan Miraz are the other ones who have to sit out.  New Zealand, meanwhile, will be led by Tim Southee as regular skipper Kane Williamson is one of the four changes in their squad today. Blair Tickner and Mitchell Santner are the other two changes as Martin Guptill, Trent Boult and Adam Milne start.      Following heavy defeats in their first two matches against Pakistan and hosts New Zealand, Bangladesh go into this contest with a need for a win in order to stay in contention for the T20I Tri-nation series title. But for the Tigers, there remain bigger concerns than just keeping their chances alive to make it to the final of the tournament. With the T20 World Cup just days away, Bangladesh are yet to find a solid footing in the format. It has only been downhill for the Tigers since they crashed out of the last edition of the World Cup without a single win from the Super 12s and a humiliating defeat to Scotland in their first game. Among many, the major concern for the Shakib Al Hasan-led side has been their unstable top-order, the opening pair to be more precise. In the 14 matches that Bangladesh have played in 2022 so far, they have used a total of eight different opening pairs. And as it seems, Bangladesh will have yet another new opening pair today with Soumya returning to the squad.  In the last game against New Zealand, the Tigers included Najmul Hossain Shanto in place of Sabbir Rahman, who was brought into the national side just before the Asia Cup on a whim and was thought to be the answers to Bangladesh's long-persisting opening problems as he was made part of a makeshift opening pair alongside Mehedi Hasan Miraz. Shanto played a handy knock in the last game but the opening issues, or the overall batting issues, are far from mended. The Tigers even faced huge backlash for having skipper Shakib Al Hasan bat at number seven in their last game against New Zealand. Going in today's game, Bangladesh will need to employ a much more sensible tactic if they hope to stay alive in the series.   Meanwhile, hosts New Zealand, the table toppers in the Tri-nation series, come to the game on the back of a nine-wicket thrashing of Pakistan Tuesday on a subcontinental-style pitch in Christchurch where the spinners ruled the roost.Things could turn out well for Bangladesh spinners if the pitch today remains anything like it was in the last game between Pakistan and New Zealand.   However the pitch is, the Kiwis will be aiming for yet another dominant display. A win for the hosts today will mean New Zealand and Pakistan will play the final on October 14 at the same venue.  Playing XI: Bangladesh: Najmul Hossain Shanto, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das, Shakib al Hasan (C), Afid Hossain, Mosaddek Hossain, Nurul Hasan, Yasir Ali, Mohammad Saifuddin, Ebadot Hossain, Shoriful IslamNew Zealand: Devon Conway, Finn Allen, Martin Guptill, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, James Neesham, Michael Bracewell, Ish Sodhi, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Trent Boult "

The gold standard was replaced by the dollar as the fiat currency, and all oil deals were denominated in dollars.The emergence of the mighty dollar was backed by gold, and the hegemonic transition in the aftermath of World War II that came with the rise of American geopolitical and military leadership of the Western world. The generous USD 15 billion credit by the US to the war-devastated European countries for reconstruction under the Marshall Plan of 1948 helped in this process.Today, the dollar has unparalleled supremacy. Almost all imports and exports are denominated in dollars. In addition, billions of dollars are transacted globally in the form of small private transactions, such as for travels abroad and repatriation of savings by millions of workers overseas. International transactions between businesses, countries to settle contracts, repay loans – all require dollars. Countries have to keep enough dollar reserves to pay for their import needs for at least six months or face the danger of default, poor credit ranking, and bankruptcy.Globally, USD 12-13 trillion is kept as reserve, much of which is kept with the Federal Reserve System of the US. These reserves work to the advantage of the US, which can (and does) run large budget deficits and take national loans equal to many times its GDP without much concern for bankruptcy.The dominance of the dollar and the hegemonic power which supports it have emerged as a sore point in the rising strategic competition to determine the global financial architecture.Jose Miguel Alonso-Trabanco, an international relations professional, notes, ""In this game of determining suitable financial architecture, monetary assets, control over resources are weaponised as instruments of coercion, manipulation, disruption, subordination and conquest. The realm of money is now at the forefront of rivalry for domination."" The US can and often does weaponise the dollar to support and extend their dominance. Such sanctions can be tolerated to a certain extent, but beyond that, it can backfire through powerful, destructive measures.Unlike the hard power of missiles and war machines, financial power can be used for both construction and destruction, from building alliances, to gradually weakening the economic power of countries. It can be used for patronage or denial, to gradually snap the energy of the ""disfavoured."" Financial power, coupled with another lethal weapon, the ""food diplomacy,"" can cause havoc on countries at the receiving end.Large and small nations can be subjected to its squeeze in different ways. For example, Bangladesh, during its immediate post-liberation period, was subjected to sanctions for selling jute to Cuba, leading to the deaths of thousands of people by starvation through denial of food delivery.In the context of the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the sanctions imposed by the US and the West focused on key elements of financial transactions, choking the Russian economy out of the freedom of exchanging goods and services.What impact are these sanctions expected to have on the Russian economy? It is difficult to assess at this stage. Russia, with about USD 630 billion in foreign exchange and gold reserves, was in a comfortable situation in the pre-war period. The impacts of sanctions are reported to be negative; it is observed by some that in February-May 2022, industrial production went down by nearly 70 percent, imports reduced by 50 percent, and debt portfolio increased to USD 300-400 billion.The Russians countered to stay afloat by denominating exports and imports in terms of rubles, adopting a quasi-barter system among its allies, or with countries dependent on Russia for its oil and gas. But the ruble strengthened, and Russia had to take measures to weaken the ruble for fear of adverse impacts on exports.So far, Russia is doing not so badly. But how long it can sustain the persistent pressure from the US and its Western allies remains to be seen. It could be a close call for a showdown.The key to this lies in the hands of China, another mighty economy with vast financial and commercial reach as well as hard power. It holds huge financial reserves (more than USD 3 trillion and 1,948 tonnes of gold). Allied with China, Russia can deliver a heavy counterpunch.Coercive weaponisation of financial vectors does not involve bloodshed, but it can still inflict substantial damage in terms of hunger and poverty, not necessarily on the target countries, but as unintended ""collateral damage"" on innocent ""bystander"" countries. Already, the rise of inflation and potential food shortages are sending ominous signals. Low-income countries around the world can only wait and see, and build up their own defences to the best of their capabilities against the unwelcome outcome of an ugly bullfight. Dr Atiqur Rahman is an economist, former adjunct professor at John Cabot University in Italy, and former lead strategist at IFAD.

/business/economy/news/shipbreaking-slumps-half-amid-lower-imports-3140436,Shipbreaking slumps by half amid lower imports,"Scrap vessel imports slumped by half in the first nine months of the year as Bangladesh Bank is discouraging lenders from opening letters of credit to curb the depletion of forex reserves amid the soaring cost of the US dollar.Shipbreaking yards in the country imported a total of 114 vessels between January and September, down by about 49 per cent from 225 during the same period a year ago.As such, the amount of scrap procured from dismantled ships dipped by around 56 per cent year-on-year to 9.34 lakh tonnes at the same time, according to the Bangladesh Ship Breakers and Recyclers Association (BSBRA).""We are facing difficulty in opening letters of credit to import scrap ships as banks are not showing interest in doing so,"" said BSBRA President Md Abu Taher.And although just 45 of the 158 shipbreaking yards in Chattogram are currently operational, Bangladesh topped the list of ship dismantling countries ahead of India and Pakistan in 2021, according to data from the NGO Shipbreaking Platform. A total of 763 commercial ocean-going vessels from across the globe were sold to scrap yards that year. Of them, 583 large tankers, bulkers, offshore platforms, cargo and cruise ships were broken down on the beaches of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, amounting to almost 90 per cent of the gross tonnage of scrap procured worldwide.Bangladesh dismantled 280 of these ships to get 27.28 lakh tonnes of scrap.Between January and June this year, shipbreaking yards in South Asia collectively dismantled around 272 ships with Bangladesh becoming the second-biggest demolisher after India.The NGO Shipbreaking Platform is a Belgium-based global coalition of organisations that works to reverse the environmental damage and human rights abuses caused by shipbreaking practices.Local shipbreakers and recyclers said scrap from vessels is mainly used by steel re-rolling mills and shipbuilders that make barges.Meanwhile, many shipbreaking yards in the country are suffering losses this year as they had to count high costs for the hike in US dollar prices amid the depreciation of the taka, the local currency.Kamal Uddin Ahmed, senior vice president of the BSBRA, said shipbreakers import scrap vessels on deferred payment for up to one year. Besides, they have to count an additional Tk 20 per dollar when clearing import bills.""Numerous yard owners have gone bankrupt because of the high cost of the greenback,"" he added.Alongside the dollar shortage and subsequent lack of interest among banks to open letters of credit for purchasing scrap ships, the demand for re-rollable steel plates used to make rods has also dropped. In addition, a rise in sea freight has reduced the availability of ships for scrapping globally.""Overall, businesses are not willing to take risks,"" Ahmed said.Mohammed Ali Shahin, the coordinator of the advocacy unit of Young Power in Social Action, an NGO which works on the shipbreaking industry and workers' rights, said falling scrap vessel imports have reduced the employment scope for workers.He also said most shipbreaking yards are run by hiring workers on a contractual basis while some have started hiring workers permanently.""We have engaged with owners and some of them are supporting workers from their welfare funds. But if the situation prolongs, there will be an adverse effect on workers,"" Shahin said, adding that the livelihoods of 30,000 workers would be threatened. "

Some people are now shedding crocodile tears about the changes in BCCI,"" said the party's vice-president Dilip Ghosh.Current BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal, younger brother of the country's sports minister Anurag Thakur, is expected to be elected chairman of the Indian Premier League."

/sports/sports-special/t20-world-cup-2022/news/buttler-leads-front-england-target-t20-wc-glory-3140961,Buttler leads from front as England target T20 WC glory,"Jos Buttler is back in his all-action role as captain, opening batsman and wicketkeeper as power-packed England prepare to launch their bid for Twenty20 World Cup glory.The white ball star missed his side's recent 4-3 series win in Pakistan with a calf injury and in his absence Alex Hales and Phil Salt impressed at the top of the batting order, with Salt taking the gloves.But Buttler appeared to end speculation over whether he might relinquish his wicket-keeping role or drop down the batting order in the first game of a three-match series against Australia on Sunday.The 32-year-old opened alongside Hales and smacked 68 off 32 balls as England defeated the World Cup hosts and holders by eight runs in Perth.Buttler and Test captain Ben Stokes, who was not in the squad in Pakistan, will boost an already strong batting line-up, with all-rounder Liam Livingstone and ""death-overs"" specialist Chris Jordan also added into the mix.Buttler, who succeeded Eoin Morgan as England's white-ball captain earlier this year, is hoping to lead the reigning 50-over world champions to just their second T20 triumph, 12 years after their first.England's Test team have sparkled in recent months under Stokes but Buttler and new white-ball coach Matthew Mott have found success harder to come by, even though they are ranked second in T20 cricket.England lost T20 and one-day international series against India in July before drawing an ODI series against South Africa and then suffering a defeat at the hands of the Proteas in the subsequent T20 series.Those results led to questions over whether Buttler, a member of England's winning team in the 50-over World Cup in 2019, was being asked to juggle too many roles.That debate intensified in Pakistan, where the recalled Hales and Salt both made their mark after England had dropped struggling opener Jason Roy from the squad.The emergence of Harry Brook at number five in Pakistan -- he was England's leading run-scorer on tour with 238 runs at a strike-rate of 163 -- also complicated the debate about where all-rounder Stokes will fit in the side.But Buttler has made it clear that he wants Stokes to bat as high up the order as possible and he was sent in at number three against Australia, who are in England's Super 12 group at the tournament.Stokes, playing his first T20 match for England since March 2021, managed only nine runs in Perth while Brook came in at four and made 12.'A BIT OF TINKERING' ""There's always a bit of tinkering, form comes into it,"" Mott, previously in charge of Australia's all-conquering women's team, told Sky Sports ahead of the series against Australia.""Obviously Harry Brook has had some really good hit-outs and done well. He's looked really composed out there and seems to just pick the right times to go for his boundaries.""Salt kept wicket for Manchester Originals during the Hundred competition in England this year, allowing Buttler to lead the side from the outfield, but the national team skipper was back behind the stumps in Perth.England are among the World Cup favourites along with Australia and India, but there is a worry about lack of penetration with the ball in a format favouring big-hitting batsmen.The return of Mark Wood, who topped speeds of 97 miles per hour (156 km/h), and Chris Woakes in Pakistan bolstered England's pace attack and gave the selectors welcome options.""Woody got through a few, Woakes got through a couple and we're building nicely with that depth we are after for the World Cup,"" said Mott, who can also call on dangerous left-armer Reece Topley, who offers pace and bounce.Leg-spinner Adil Rashid had a disappointing tour of Pakistan, taking just five wickets at an average of nearly 45 but will again be a key weapon in England's armoury, giving Buttler welcome variation.England are in a World Cup group with Afghanistan, Australia, New Zealand and two teams who qualify from the first round.They open their tournament on October 22 against Afghanistan in Perth.

Only Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia have used it so far.Its proposal was to expand the Common Framework's eligibility so that all heavily indebted countries could utilise it rather just the 70 or so poorest countries, and for any debt payments to be automatically suspended during the process.""Both will act as an incentive for creditors to participate and to maintain a reasonable timeline, and it could also remove some of the hesitancy caused by rating fears for debtor countries,"" the report said.It also recommended creditors should have a legal duty to cooperate ""in good faith"" in a Common Framework restructuring and that countries could offer to take eco-friendly measures to encourage creditors to write their down debt.""It makes a lot of sense,"" the report said. ""Not only have these countries contributed the least to, but bear the highest cost of, climate change""."

The United States will be watching the situation closely ""over the coming weeks and months,"" she said.OPEC+ announced plans for an oil production cut last week after weeks of lobbying against one by US officials. The United States accused Saudi Arabia of kowtowing to Russia, which objects to a Western cap on the price of Russian oil spurred by the Ukraine invasion.US officials had been quietly trying to persuade its biggest Arab partner to nix the idea of a production cut, but Saudi Arabia's de factor ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was not swayed.Bin Salman and Biden had clashed during Biden's visit to Jeddah in July over the death in 2018 of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, according to a source familiar with the situation.US intelligence says the crown prince approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, a Saudi insider-turned-critic, who was murdered and dismembered by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.The prince, son of King Salman, 86, has denied ordering the killing but acknowledged it took place ""under my watch.""

Sevilla, in third spot on two points, still have a slim chance of reaching the last 16.VAR took centre stage in an action-packed first half in Copenhagen. City thought they had taken the lead 11 minutes in with a goal-of-the-season contender from Rodri, only for the strike to be ruled out for handball in the build-up.The video assistant referee stepped in again moments later to help City win a penalty for another handball, but Riyad Mahrez saw his spot kick saved by home goalkeeper Kamil Grabara.A busy VAR then asked the referee to have another look at a foul by Sergio Gomez on the edge of the penalty area on the half hour mark, with the on-field official choosing to show the City full back a red card for denying a goalscoring opportunity.The 10 men more than held their own in the second half, but with Liverpool to come in the Premier League at the weekend and qualification for the knockout stage almost secured, City left top goalscorer Erling Haaland on the bench and saw out the draw.Top of Group G with 10 points from four matches, City will be sure of a place in the last 16 if Sevilla lose or draw at Borussia Dortmund later on Tuesday, while Copenhagen are third on two points.""Many players didn't start today because they were exhausted and tired and fatigued and (had) niggles,"" City coach Pep Guardiola said. ""Erling didn't feel really good after the game against Southampton, Phil (Foden) had some disturbing problems, Bernardo (Silva) told us yesterday he was so tired.""We adapted really well (to the red card). They are too good. We're close (to qualifying). It's a good point.""City players were furious that Mahrez was adjudged to have handled the ball before setting up Rodri for the Spaniard's thunderbolt.However, none of them appealed for the penalty that was awarded after the ball struck home defender Nicolai Boilesen on the arm from a City corner, with the referee having checked the pitchside monitor again.Mahrez never looked comfortable and has now missed two of his last three spot kicks, while City have missed 24 penalties in all competitions under Pep Guardiola, nine more than any other Premier League side since the Spaniard took charge in 2016.Gomez, who is yet to start a league game for City, then pulled back Hakon Arnar Haraldsson when through on goal. No foul was given initially, but VAR again took over to change the referee's mind.With Norwegian goalscoring phenomenon Haaland on the sidelines, having not started for City for the first time this season in all competitions, the visitors failed to finish off several good second-half chances.Kevin De Bruyne twice drilled wide from good positions, while Joao Cancelo was denied by a smart save from Grabara.With Copenhagen happy to take anything from a team who hammered them 5-0 in Manchester last week, the latter stages were played at a slower pace, with City's job also done."

The goal meant he became PSG's top scorer in the Champions League with 31 goals -- one more than Edinson Cavani.Mbappe was at it again six minutes into the second half, but his curled, right-footed effort went just wide.Benfica then levelled shortly after the hour as Mario converted a spot kick after a bad foul on Rafa Silva by Marco Verratti.Both teams seemed content with one point each from an underwhelming encounter, which left them on the brink of qualification for the last 16.PSG next host Maccabi on Oct. 25 when Benfica will take on Juventus."
/opinion/editorial/news/can-bangladesh-government-tame-raging-inflation-3141056,Can Bangladesh government tame raging inflation?,"We're worried by the continuing inflationary trend which seems poised to hit a boiling point, with data released by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) saying that inflation hit a 10-year high in August. Overall, inflation surged to 9.52 percent in August, then dropping to a still-high 9.10 percent in September. Ordinary people, however, don't need BBS figures to know how badly prices have been spiralling out of control in recent months. Their daily suffering stands as living proof of that.Therefore, we once again urge the government to consider lowering fuel prices at the earliest possible time, since it has had a cascading effect on prices of all other commodities. For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. Therefore, we once again urge the government to consider lowering fuel prices at the earliest possible time, since it has had a cascading effect on prices of all other commodities.Inflation, which has been ongoing since the outbreak of the pandemic in Bangladesh, has been out of control for the past several months due to higher food prices amid global supply chain disruptions and trade uncertainties arising from the Russia-Ukraine war. Data shows that food inflation soared to 9.94 percent in August – the highest since April 2012 – and decreased slightly to 9.08 percent in September. Non-food inflation, on the other hand, was 8.85 percent in August, but jumped to 9.13 percent in September, indicating that the inflationary momentum is yet to dissipate. Another major concern is that inflation in rural areas has been worse than in urban areas – 9.70 percent in August, as opposed to 9.18 percent in urban areas during the same month. Food inflation in rural areas was similarly higher, since markets there tend to be more volatile than those in urban areas.This calls for greater government assistance for lower- and fixed-income groups. But equally importantly, it indicates that the assistance needs to be better targeted, with food assistance for people living in rural areas becoming more urgent. Additionally, while external shocks are definitely big factors that are driving inflation, the recent fuel price hike in the country has, as anticipated, only made things worse. Therefore, we once again urge the government to consider lowering fuel prices at the earliest possible time, since it has had a cascading effect on prices of all other commodities. The government also urgently needs to curb corruption and wastage in the energy sector, which have gone totally out of control, leading to the return of frequent load-shedding that is only increasing production costs and commodity prices for end consumers.Because there is no single policy intervention that can solve the current crisis, the government needs to try and tackle it on multiple fronts. Firstly, the government needs to scale up its subsidised food assistance programme for the poor. It needs to reduce corruption and mismanagement across all sectors, which seems to have become synonymous with governance these days. And finally, it needs to actively monitor the supply of essential commodities, such as different food items, and make sure that it is proactive in addressing any artificial supply shortage. In that regard, regular market monitoring by relevant government agencies is vital to root out any collusive practices by powerful trade syndicates."

/life-living/news/parenting-mothers-open-sharing-their-biggest-regrets-3140916,Parenting: Mothers open up sharing their biggest regrets ,"Parents, especially those of young children, usually experience a multitude of emotions all through the day. Be it enjoying the morning kisses to wanting to sleep longer, play times versus work engagements, or that one last bedtime story over their own need for personal time, they find themselves vacillating between two extremes: unconditional love and unending frustration.It is not uncommon for parents of young children to wish their children would grow up faster and not need their parents quite as much, especially after his fourth public meltdown, or on her third consecutive nightmare interruption in a night. However, here's presenting the biggest contradiction of them all: parents miss this connection when it's gone.Mothers, especially those whose children have hit puberty or flown out of the nest, often feel the absence of this kind of connection much more acutely than others because they have understood how fleeting it is.Even if it seems never-ending when it is there, children grow out of their clingy or needy behaviour in the blink of an eye. Frustrated as parents get at their constant demands to be picked up, rocked to sleep, or played with, it is only when children begin to shrug out of the hugs and push away the kisses, that one feels, with a pang, how much they will miss this closeness.A talk with several empty-nesters, the ones who have been through it all, revealed a number of things parents miss, now that their fullest years of parenting are behind them.Older mothers, retrospectively feel like they may have overworked themselves back in the day and spent too much time stressing about work and finances when what they really needed was to be present with their children — involved in play and school activities and family dinners. ""I'm still working, but the time with my children under one roof is gone,"" ruminates a mother, pensively.A few others find themselves feeling like they wasted a lot of time worrying about their children's nutritional needs. Worrying about picky eaters, or justifying formula as opposed to breastmilk did nothing but make mealtimes fussy, they feel. Their children ended up eating food off the dirty floor and junk food anyway, and did fairly well, (surprisingly), nutritionally speaking.The same goes for academic learning, for some parents.""Everything comes at the right time for each individual child,"" says one empty-nester. She wishes she had not worried about her child 'keeping up' with the other children at school. It is more important, she says, to concentrate teaching them basic life skills such as cooking, doing house chores, budget and save and properly deal with anxiety. ""Those are the things they really need guidance for.""We all know of at least one mother who looks great, has impeccable looking kids and a house worthy of being a film set. Most of those efforts are unnecessary, say experienced mothers. It's more important to have a happy home rather than a pristine one. Saying yes more and prioritising feelings over routines would have been infinitely more rewarding, laments one mother. ""Your children won't remember how spotless the kitchen was, but they will remember the quality time they spent with you,"" reminisces another."

/tech-startup/news/mars-very-likely-hosted-alien-life-the-past-study-suggests-3140771,"Mars 'very likely' hosted alien life in the past, study suggests","According to a recent study, ""methanogens""—a class of organisms—likely lived in underground lairs on Mars billions of years ago and may still do so today.The study offers a tantalising glimpse of how microbial aliens could have emerged and survived on the red planet and concludes that Mars was ""very likely"" habitable to life more than 3.7 billion years ago and may still be home to hardy organisms today.Mars, today, is cold and dry. But there is a wealth of evidence to suggest that this world was once warmer, wetter, and more hospitable to life. In order to look for signs of extinct aliens that may have lived there billions of years ago, NASA's Perseverance rover is currently exploring the dried-out remnants of what was once a vast ancient lakebed on Mars, known as Jezero Crater.A team of researchers led by Boris Sauterey, a biologist at the Institut de Biologie de l'École Normale Supérieure in France, has published a groundbreaking study that evaluates the possibility of hydrogen-eating methanogens on early Mars and makes predictions about the future survival of any hypothetical descendants of these organisms.Even though there is no proof that life has ever existed on Mars, scientists have theorised that methanogens, which are among the oldest life forms on Earth, may have thrived in the planet's early environments. Methanogens produce methane as a waste product and get their energy from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, both of which were present on ancient Mars.The researchers also found that the early Martian microbes' activities would have caused a global cooling effect, possibly resulting in their own extinction. For billions of years, life has also changed the climate here on Earth, but these feedback loops have generally preserved and even improved the habitability of our planet. According to the new study, transient life may develop on many planets, but the kind of long-term habitability we have on Earth might be an exception."

/world/europe/news/europe-blame-energy-crisis-says-putin-3141066,"Europe to blame for energy crisis, says Putin","Russia's president said Europe was to blame for its energy crisis with policies that starved the oil and gas industry of investment and said price caps would make it worse, as EU states tried to forge a deal on ways to contain soaring energy costs.Worries about the security of energy supplies were heightened on Wednesday when a leak in Poland on the Druzhba pipeline from Russia reduced the flow of oil to Germany.Poland said the leak was probably caused by an accident but it came as European Union nations are seeking to wean themselves off a reliance on Russian energy in response to the invasion of Ukraine in February.The Nord Stream gas link to Germany is now out of action after a leak last month that both Russia and the West have blamed on sabotage, without identifying who was behind it.President Vladimir Putin said leaks in the two Nord Stream pipelines running under the Baltic Sea were an ""act of international terrorism"" to deprive people of cheap energy.Putin said gas could still be supplied by one intact part of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline but it was up to the EU whether or not it wanted the gas.Germany froze the Nord Stream 2 project days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine and a German government spokesperson on Wednesday ruled out taking gas via that route.Putin also floated the idea of creating an alternative European gas hub via Turkey.""We could move the lost volumes along the Nord Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region and thus make the main routes for the supply of our fuel, our natural gas to Europe through Turkey,"" Putin told an energy forum in Russia.""That is, of course, if our partners are interested in this. And economic feasibility, of course,"" he said.Putin said Moscow was not to blame for Europe's sky-high energy prices and pointed at the EU's green energy drive, saying it led to underinvestment in the global oil and gas industry.The Group of Seven (G7) countries have been discussing a cap on Russian oil prices, a move Putin said would deepen problems.The impact of efforts to use less Russian energy, plus steep cuts in supplies from Russia, have been felt across the 27-nation EU, with gas prices almost 90% higher than a year ago and fears of rationing and power cuts over the coming winter.PRAGUE TALKSEU energy ministers were meeting in Prague on Wednesday to try to agree new measures to tackle the crisis.Most EU countries say they want a gas price cap, but disagree on its design. Some countries, including Germany, Europe's biggest gas market, remain opposed, arguing it risks choking off supplies.Germany and the Netherlands put forward their own proposals before Wednesday's meeting in the Czech capital - suggesting 10 ""no-regret"" EU measures, including a new benchmark price for liquefied natural gas, tougher targets to save gas, and negotiating lower prices with other suppliers, such as Norway.In neighbouring Poland, pipeline operator PERN said a leak was detected on Tuesday evening in a section of the Druzhba oil pipe around 70 kilometres (43 miles) from the central Polish city of Plock.The Druzhba pipeline, whose name means ""friendship"" in Russian, is one of the world's largest, supplying Russian oil to much of central Europe.""Here we can talk about accidental damage,"" Poland's top official in charge of energy infrastructure Mateusz Berger told Reuters by telephone.Germany's PCK Refinery in the eastern town of Schwedt, which supplies 90% of Berlin's fuel, said it was still receiving oil deliveries from the Druzhba pipeline but at reduced capacity.SUPPORT MEASURESThe energy crisis has had knock-on effects across the whole of Europe as businesses have passed on extra costs, squeezing household budgets.Governments are also trying to figure out how to fund emergency measures taken to protect customers and smooth out the distortions caused by the surge in prices.EU member Portugal plans to inject 3 billion euros ($2.9 billion) into its electricity and natural gas systems to curb prices paid by companies next year, the government said on Wednesday.In Britain, the new government set out plans for a temporary revenue limit on low-carbon electricity generators, which the industry said was a ""de-facto windfall tax"" on renewable energy producers.Rocketing gas prices across Europe and Britain have driven up the cost of electricity."

/news/world/usa/news/biden-re-evaluate-saudi-ties-after-opec-snub-3140556,Biden to ‘re-evaluate’ Saudi ties after OPEC snub,"President Joe Biden is to ""re-evaluate"" the US relationship with Saudi Arabia in light of the OPEC+ decision to cut oil production, a White House spokesperson said yesterday.""I think the president's been very clear that this is a relationship that we need to continue to re-evaluate, that we need to be willing to revisit,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN.""Certainly in light of the OPEC decision, I think that's where he is.""The 13-nation, Saudi-led OPEC cartel and its 10 allies headed by Russia agreed last week to reduce output by two million barrels a day from November -- raising fears that oil prices could soar.The decision was widely seen as a diplomatic slap in the face, since Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in July and met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, despite vowing to make the kingdom an international ""pariah"" following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.It also comes at a sensitive moment for Biden's Democratic party, as it faces November midterm elections with rising consumer prices a key Republican talking point.Kirby added that Biden is ""willing to work with Congress to think through what that relationship (with Saudi Arabia) ought to look like going forward.""His remarks come a day after Senator Bob Menendez, the lead Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for Washington to halt all cooperation with Saudi Arabia.""The US must immediately freeze all aspects of our cooperation with Saudi Arabia, including any arms sales and security cooperation beyond what is absolutely necessary to defend US personnel and interests,"" Menendez said.""As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I will not green-light any cooperation with Riyadh until the kingdom reassesses its position with respect to the war in Ukraine.""Biden said last week that he would look at alternatives to prevent more price hikes. These could include further releases from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, potentially increased US domestic drilling, and more drastic measures, including limits on exports."
/opinion/views/news/why-climate-needs-be-part-higher-education-3140976,Why climate needs to be a part of higher education,"In order to equip the future generations with the skills to deal with climate change, the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) has a target – Target 4.7 – that requires that, by 2030, all learners will acquire the knowledge and skills through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyle, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture's contribution to sustainable development. Indicators to check the progress of Target 4.7 are the extent to which global citizenship education and education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment. So, we have an excellent target and related indicators to measure the progress.However, what is the reality in the mainstream model of education? Since the 1972 Stockholm environmental conference, promotion of environmental education began to be mainstreamed into educational curricula, led globally by Unesco. Then came Chapter 36 of the Agenda 21 on Education, adopted at the Earth Summit in 1992, and finally SDG 4. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports call for action in striking a balance between lowering energy and resource intensity and promoting decarbonisation. But they overlook and underestimate the role of education in climate change, linking it narrowly to behavioural change through education and community approaches, including local and Indigenous knowledge. It is unsurprising that hardly any educator participated in writing the IPCC reports.However, this oversight reveals a much deeper issue, which is a de facto endorsement of business-as-usual in education, as a solution to environmental change. The assumption is that a wider access to quality education would automatically translate into higher environmental awareness and behavioural change, and most international development efforts have consistently prioritised Western education models that focus on economic growth and social equity over environmental issues. So, the education-related works of the World Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Unesco explicitly promote human capital theory, to realise the infinite growth paradigm. While their official statements align with SDG 4, they are targeted for promoting economic growth, as if there is no conflict between continued growth and environmental sustainability. Such angelisation of GDP growth is short-sighted, at the expense of limited environmental resources. This is evident from serious ecological crises all over the world.But sustainable growth – the physical expansion of economies – is an oxymoron, because the former cannot continue ad infinitum in a bounded global ecological system. This oversight is the reason that education and research on SDG 4.7 (sustainable lifestyles and global citizenship) remains a neglected area. Unesco's Institute of Statistics has focused its efforts on developing metrics for SDG 4.1- 4.6, while leaving SDG 4.7 unaddressed; this omission is evident in the SDG 4 Data Book: Global Education Indicators 2018. Any discussion on SDG 4.7 is almost always linked to improvements in individual cognitive skills, suggesting that SDG 4 goals can be achieved under the current education paradigm.But research by environmental psychologists shows that higher cognitive skills and knowledge do not necessarily prompt citizens into environment-friendly action. Rather, culture, including the concept of self (independent or interdependent self), affects how people are guided towards action. Western countries with dominant ""independent"" selfhood have higher carbon dioxide emissions and ecological footprints than in cultures with ""interdependent"" selfhood. Looking at the increasing disconnect between climate science and climate policies at international and national levels, it is clear that the Earth does not need mere ""educated"" consumers of knowledge; rather, it needs more ""environmentally-educated"" consumers.This reality calls for a fundamental reconceptualisation of education itself, along the line of famous American ecologist Aldo Leopold, that we need not just higher ""volume"" of education, but a change in its ""content."" This will bring into sharp relief, together with knowledge and skills (curriculum), access and equity (structure), a more fundamental revaluation of self and others (our being), i.e. culture and our relationship with ""nature."" We must fundamentally change the way we think of economic growth as the road to sustainable development, because the latter does not always require growth for improving the quality of life. While many developing countries still need environment-friendly growth for development, developed countries must focus on qualitative development, as they have achieved enough quantitative growth through mass and junk productions. So, understanding interactions, particularly negative loops, among different SDGs and different dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental – is instrumental in rethinking whether and under what conditions education can contribute to limiting climate change. This calls for a scathing critique of independent self-based Western model of education, with predominant focus on imparting knowledge and skills in numeracy. Do these skills fostering reflection over our ""being"" among students result in wisdom and self-realisation? Perhaps not.In the end, let me recall the wisdom of Spanish philosopher Ortega Gasset, who criticised the modern trend in university education of micro and macro specialisations, which create ""learned ignorants"" who lose sight of the forest for the trees and leaves. We must maintain a balance between breadth and depth in disciplines across university departments. At a minimum, we must set a goal of ecological literacy for all our students at the tertiary level. No student should graduate from universities without a comprehension of the basic principles of ecology and ecological economics, carrying capacity, energetics, end-use analysis, how to live a good life, limits of technology, appropriate scale, sustainable agriculture and forestry, steady-state economics, and environmental ethics. As Leopold very cogently asked, ""If education does not teach us these things, then what is education for?""Dr Mizan R Khan is deputy director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), and technical lead at the LDC Universities' Consortium on Climate Change (LUCCC)."

/chattogram/news/pollution-killing-karnaphuli-plants-3140596,Pollution killing Karnaphuli plants,"As many as 81 species of plants on Karnaphuli riverbanks are in danger of going extinct over the next few decades due to the dumping of industrial wastes and other forms of pollution. Another 61 species of plants will become endangered if no action is taken to prevent pollution, revealed a study titled ""Floristic status and impacts of anthropological activities towards degradation of the Karnaphuli river and surrounding areas"".Mohammad Omar Farooq Russel, associate professor of Department of Botany at Chittagong University, and his team presented their research findings at a seminar at Chattogram Press Club recently.The study was carried out in collaboration with port city-based environmental organisation Effective Creation on Human Opinion (ECHO).The researchers conducted a field survey from January to August to identify the species of riverside plants and sources of pollution.According to the study, the river is being polluted from 89 sources, which includes 53 industries.The study found that there are 528 species of plants on the Karnaphuli riverbank. Of them, 144 are large trees, 69 shrubs, 58 vines, 244 ferns and 13 parasitic plants.According to a DoE report, 35 out of 140 species of fish can no longer be found there because of pollution.
The research team also found the movement of dolphins at 64 places in Karnaphuli river, which is also being disrupted due to unabated pollution.
Omar Farooq said, ""Waste is being dumped directly into the river from seven industrial factories situated on both banks. We have collected waste samples and analysed them in our labs, following which we found the presence of toxic chemicals.""
Besides, more than 22,000 tonnes of wastes are being generated at Chattogram every day, most of which flow into Karnaphuli river through different canals and drains due to poor drainage system.
Also, over 4,000 ships and 10,000 registered and unregistered vessels ply the river every month, contributing to the river pollution by emitting harmful gas and dumping wastes.
Dr Idrish Ali, professor of chemistry department of Govt Haji Mohammad Mohsin College, said, ""To save the 528 recognised plant species, there's no alternatives to stopping pollution.""
The Department of Environment (DoE) in Chattogram has also conducted several surveys on the Karnaphuli recently.
According to a DoE report, 35 out of 140 species of fish can no longer be found there because of pollution.
Mofidul Alam, director of DoE, Chattogram, said, ""We have instructed industries operating by the Karnaphuli to set up Effluent Treatment Plants for waste management.""
Just like the Buriganga in Dhaka, encroachment of the river goes hand in hand with the pollution level in the Karnaphuli.
Chattogram District Administration made a list of 2,112 grabbers along a 40km stretch of the river from Kalurghat to Patenga, following a 2010 HC order.
Since 2016, the court has issued several directives at different times ordering the district administration, Chattogram Port Authority (CPA) and Chattogram Development Authority (CDA) to remove illegal structures from the riverbanks.
Till date, none of the authorities have fully complied with the court orders.

/business/economy/news/worsening-electricity-supply-fresh-blow-industries-3140456,Worsening electricity supply fresh blow to industries,"Industries, already under huge pressure for the fall in gas supply and higher input costs, have been hit with power outages in the last few days, which have raised the production cost and may force factories to cut output. Due to a gas and fuel shortage, many power plants in Bangladesh are not operating to their usual capacity. This is hurting the manufacturing industry.For example, Igloo Ice Cream, a popular ice cream brand in Bangladesh, now has to spend Tk 4.70 to produce a litre of ice cream, up from Tk 4.54 in 2021, owing to higher diesel costs.""Due to the load-shedding, the production cost has increased by Tk 0.16 per litre of ice cream,"" said Shamim Ahmed, chief operating officer of the company.Igloo, which holds a 33 per cent stake in the market and is the leading brand in the segment, produces 1.5 lakh litres of ice cream per day. This means it has to spend an additional Tk 24,000 per day to keep the factory operational.Now, our production units witness at least eight hours of load-shedding every day whereas it was at best four hours just a few days ago.Shamim Ahmed, Chief Operating Officer of Igloo Ice Cream
According to Ahmed, the company has had to maintain an alternative source of power using gas to continue production. Sometimes the flow of gas drops, disrupting production since the supply of electricity is a must to maintain a cold temperature.



""Now, our production units witness at least eight hours of load-shedding every day whereas it was at best four hours just a few days ago.""
The ice cream industry is not the only segment that is facing the power crisis. In fact, all manufacturing sectors, including the export-oriented ones, have been suffering for the severe load-shedding for the last three to four days.
According to the Bangladesh Power Development Board, there is a power shortage of about 2,500 megawatts a day.
The regular power outages have increased the cost of production and the workforce has remained unutilised for several hours, according to industry insiders.
Monjurul Alam, director for global business development at Beacon Pharmaceuticals, said the sector has been facing an acute gas crisis for the last three months. This has hampered production and sent the cost of manufacturing higher.
""Earlier we spent Tk 80 lakh against gas for the generation of power to ensure an interrupted supply of electricity. But now we have to spend Tk 4.8 crore as we rely on diesel to generate power.""
Beacon has already suspended its production at the injection unit due to a lack of uninterrupted power supply, he said.
""This will affect the export of pharmaceutical products as manufacturers will not be able to ship goods on time.""
Amid the worsening power situation, Beacon decided not to accept an export order worth $1 million from the UK yesterday, according to Alam.
RFL Group's Habiganj industrial park is also facing a power crisis.
""Now we have to spend Tk 15 against electricity to manufacture one tonne of plastic finished products. The electricity to produce the same products would cost us Tk 12 during normal times,"" said RN Paul, managing director of the conglomerate.
Due to a lack of gas supply, the group can't maintain the lead time for export delivery. ""As a result, the export of plastic goods might decline,"" Paul warned.
M Shahadat Hossain, managing director of Towel Tex Ltd, said the company has been suffering 10 to 11 hours of power outages every day for the last few days.
The company needs 400 litres of diesel per day to run the factory and the cost has gone up to Tk 43,600.
""If I run the factory with the electricity from the national grid, it costs Tk 10.69 per unit whereas it is now costing around Tk 30 since I have to generate power using diesel,"" said Hossain, also the chairman of Bangladesh Terry Towel & Linen Manufacturers & Exporters Association.
Because of the inadequate power supply, the industry is finding it difficult to maintain lead time and is set to suffer reduced profit margins.
""Entrepreneurs have kept their factories up and running so that they can retain buyers and don't lose export orders,"" said Hossain.
Irfan Uddin, general secretary of the Bangladesh Ceramic Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BCMEA), said the production cost has increased due to the load-shedding and the gas crisis.
The government has stopped the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to protect the foreign currency reserves from depleting amid a sharp rise in import bills driven by the escalated costs in the global commodities market.
According to the BCMEA, the gas bill accounts for 12 per cent of the total input cost of producing ceramic products and 80 per cent of factories are dependent on gas-based captive power plants.
At least 25 out of 70 factories in the ceramic sector have been suffering from an acute gas crisis for more than three months, said Irfan.
""Even, factories are not getting gas for 12 hours a day and this is hindering the production of the factories. As a result, the sector has faced a 40 per cent output loss.""
Debasish Singha, head of export of Danish Biscuit, owned by Partex Star Group, said the biscuit manufacturing industry is facing reduced production and increased cost.
Besides, raw materials go to waste if the power supply stops during the production of biscuits, he said.
Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said the current load-shedding scenario is directly affecting the manufacturing sector of Bangladesh.
""If the situation persists, manufacturers will have to cut production. Then, the industrial contribution to the gross domestic product will decline.""
The industrial sector accounts for 37.07 per cent of Bangladesh's GDP.
Bangladesh is not the lone country that is facing a gas and power crisis. Rather, all energy-importing nations are in trouble as energy prices have rocketed owing to the Russia-Ukraine war.
""A stable gas supply is important for the industrial sector. But the situation is not favourable for the government due to the Ukraine war,"" said Moazzem, suggesting the government give attention to exploring gas locally.
The worsening power situation is also threatening the macroeconomy.
""Export growth is expected to slow as economic conditions in the key export markets deteriorate, while rolling blackouts, gas rationing, and rising input costs weigh on manufacturing output,"" said the World Bank on Thursday.
It has slashed its economic growth projection for Bangladesh for the current fiscal year to 6.1 per cent from 6.7 per cent made in June,
BCMEA's Irfan hopes that the situation would improve by November as the government has assured them of an uninterrupted gas supply as winter approaches. Electricity consumption falls during winter.
Now, our production units witness at least eight hours of load-shedding every day whereas it was at best four hours just a few days ago.According to Ahmed, the company has had to maintain an alternative source of power using gas to continue production. Sometimes the flow of gas drops, disrupting production since the supply of electricity is a must to maintain a cold temperature.""Now, our production units witness at least eight hours of load-shedding every day whereas it was at best four hours just a few days ago.""The ice cream industry is not the only segment that is facing the power crisis. In fact, all manufacturing sectors, including the export-oriented ones, have been suffering for the severe load-shedding for the last three to four days.According to the Bangladesh Power Development Board, there is a power shortage of about 2,500 megawatts a day.The regular power outages have increased the cost of production and the workforce has remained unutilised for several hours, according to industry insiders.Monjurul Alam, director for global business development at Beacon Pharmaceuticals, said the sector has been facing an acute gas crisis for the last three months. This has hampered production and sent the cost of manufacturing higher.""Earlier we spent Tk 80 lakh against gas for the generation of power to ensure an interrupted supply of electricity. But now we have to spend Tk 4.8 crore as we rely on diesel to generate power.""Beacon has already suspended its production at the injection unit due to a lack of uninterrupted power supply, he said.""This will affect the export of pharmaceutical products as manufacturers will not be able to ship goods on time.""Amid the worsening power situation, Beacon decided not to accept an export order worth $1 million from the UK yesterday, according to Alam.RFL Group's Habiganj industrial park is also facing a power crisis.""Now we have to spend Tk 15 against electricity to manufacture one tonne of plastic finished products. The electricity to produce the same products would cost us Tk 12 during normal times,"" said RN Paul, managing director of the conglomerate.Due to a lack of gas supply, the group can't maintain the lead time for export delivery. ""As a result, the export of plastic goods might decline,"" Paul warned.M Shahadat Hossain, managing director of Towel Tex Ltd, said the company has been suffering 10 to 11 hours of power outages every day for the last few days.The company needs 400 litres of diesel per day to run the factory and the cost has gone up to Tk 43,600.""If I run the factory with the electricity from the national grid, it costs Tk 10.69 per unit whereas it is now costing around Tk 30 since I have to generate power using diesel,"" said Hossain, also the chairman of Bangladesh Terry Towel & Linen Manufacturers & Exporters Association.Because of the inadequate power supply, the industry is finding it difficult to maintain lead time and is set to suffer reduced profit margins.""Entrepreneurs have kept their factories up and running so that they can retain buyers and don't lose export orders,"" said Hossain.Irfan Uddin, general secretary of the Bangladesh Ceramic Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BCMEA), said the production cost has increased due to the load-shedding and the gas crisis.The government has stopped the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to protect the foreign currency reserves from depleting amid a sharp rise in import bills driven by the escalated costs in the global commodities market.According to the BCMEA, the gas bill accounts for 12 per cent of the total input cost of producing ceramic products and 80 per cent of factories are dependent on gas-based captive power plants.At least 25 out of 70 factories in the ceramic sector have been suffering from an acute gas crisis for more than three months, said Irfan.""Even, factories are not getting gas for 12 hours a day and this is hindering the production of the factories. As a result, the sector has faced a 40 per cent output loss.""Debasish Singha, head of export of Danish Biscuit, owned by Partex Star Group, said the biscuit manufacturing industry is facing reduced production and increased cost.Besides, raw materials go to waste if the power supply stops during the production of biscuits, he said.Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said the current load-shedding scenario is directly affecting the manufacturing sector of Bangladesh.""If the situation persists, manufacturers will have to cut production. Then, the industrial contribution to the gross domestic product will decline.""The industrial sector accounts for 37.07 per cent of Bangladesh's GDP.Bangladesh is not the lone country that is facing a gas and power crisis. Rather, all energy-importing nations are in trouble as energy prices have rocketed owing to the Russia-Ukraine war.""A stable gas supply is important for the industrial sector. But the situation is not favourable for the government due to the Ukraine war,"" said Moazzem, suggesting the government give attention to exploring gas locally.The worsening power situation is also threatening the macroeconomy.""Export growth is expected to slow as economic conditions in the key export markets deteriorate, while rolling blackouts, gas rationing, and rising input costs weigh on manufacturing output,"" said the World Bank on Thursday.It has slashed its economic growth projection for Bangladesh for the current fiscal year to 6.1 per cent from 6.7 per cent made in June,BCMEA's Irfan hopes that the situation would improve by November as the government has assured them of an uninterrupted gas supply as winter approaches. Electricity consumption falls during winter."

/daily-star-books/news/sultanas-dream-new-penguin-classics-edition-and-audiobook-3140931,‘Sultana’s Dream’ in new Penguin Classics edition and audiobook ,"""Sultana's Dream"" (1905), Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain's iconic novella and one of the first pieces of English fiction writing produced by a Bengali Muslim woman, was recently published in a new a Penguin Classics edition, on August 9, 2022. Sultana's Dream and Padmarag's previous edition came out in 2005. ""Her novella Padmarag is similarly utopian in its depiction of a women-run school and welfare center, and is both feminist and anti-colonial in its outlook"", the edition states. The first successful Penguin Classics edition published The Odyssey in 1946. Since then, the series' definition of ""classics"" has evolved, ranging from works of antiquity to modern classics and more contemporary works that have left a significant impact on readers and on literary history. A particularly significant aspect of this journey has been Penguin's use of the black and white cover designs—while making the covers very simple and reducing the space for individualized artwork, the design also makes the series easy to distinguish. Penguin's orange paperbacks, therefore, are instantly recognised as works of fiction. Green paperbacks are travel accounts. Pink paperbacks comprise adventure stories, dark blue paperbacks comprise biographies, red volumes contain drama, and the purple books consist of essays. ""Sultana's Dream"" first appeared in The Indian Ladies Magazine in 1905 and was first published in book form by SK Lahiri, Kolkata in 1908. Penguin India's 2005 edition of Sultana's Dream and Padmarag offered readers the first English translation of Padmarag (1924), done by Indian historian Barnita Bagchi, Associate Professor in Comparative Literature at the Department of Languages, Literature, and Communication at Utrecht University. With Penguin's vast market reach as the biggest publishing conglomerate in the world, a text appearing in their Classics list signifies its inclusion in a canon of literature considered to be worth preserving, iconocizing, and circulating beyond its original readership. And given the visual template of the black cover, ""Sultana's Dream"" will be instantly recognisable as a classic work of world literature, one that familiarizes western readers with an iconic figure and work of South Asian literature and history.  ""At a time when British colonialism was using the treatment of women in India as justification for colonial intervention there (a rhetorical strategy still in use by the West today), Hossain's story imagines a world in which men rather than rather women are kept inside, thus framing her protest against Islamic patriarchy within a larger feminist vision that takes on Western as well as Islamic forms of gender hierarchy"", Tanya Agathocleous, Associate Professor of English, Hunter College and the Graduate Center, CUNY, writes in her Introduction to the new edition. The Introduction includes an extensive overview of Begum Rokeya's activism for women's rights and education, and its reflection in her literary work. ""Padmarag seems to be set in contemporary India, and the depiction of the school and ancillary institutions that make up Tarini Bhavan clearly draw on Hossain's experiences running both her own school and the Bengali Muslim Women's Association"", Agathocleous writes. The Introduction was also published as an essay on Electric Literature, one of the leading digital literary magazines in the United States, further widening the reach of Begum Rokeya's work to an international readership. The Penguin Classics edition of Sultana's Dream and Padmarag comes in a paperback, ebook, and as an audiobook narrated by Priya Ayyar, a television and film actor and award-winning audiobook narrator with a BFA and MFA from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, who has worked on TV shows such as Arrested Development, Law & Order: Criminal Intent and more.  "
/life-living/news/5-runway-trends-take-the-streets-autumn-3140946,5 runway trends to take to the streets this autumn,"The leaves are falling, the weather is turning, and the wardrobe is calling for an autumn revamp. If you are itching to get your hands on the newest collection, hot off the ramps, here are 5 staples that can take your fall fashion game to another level altogether.Animal prints make a comeback each year without fail and this year is no different. Turning the heat, a notch up in this cooler season, all the celebrities — from Victoria Beckham to Tom Ford — who mean business when it comes to fashion, sported some form of animal print this year on the ramp. Ocelot, snake, zebra, leopard and tiger print, everything was paraded, while Zara unfolded a huge, 64-piece animal print collection for the season.Something of a seasonal trend, pleats are one of autumn's most favoured fashion statements. Mid length numbers in knife or elite pleat styles continue to be in vogue, but experts say that it is not as much about the type of pleat as about how one styles it. One can choose to be gutsy and wear it over trousers, like how Valentino did, but for the warmer climate of Bangladesh, it is infinitely more practical to wear it on its own, with a bright coloured knit top, to spruce up the look.It may be difficult to pin the first prize on shoes this year as cone heels, slingbacks, and flats all put forward convincing displays. However, if one dedicated last year's leg trend to sock boots in dark colours, this year would undoubtedly belong to long, white boots, in high end (Balenciaga and Maison Margiela) and cheaper (Zara) options.Especially suited to cooler locations, the tweed coat is warm, nifty and something of a nostalgic return of a classic. Seen and loved extensively in the popular OTT series, The Crown, the tweed coat can be styled in all kinds of attractive ways. One can style it as an elegantly fitted coat over dresses, as a boxy, structured overcoat, as a historic, flared, comfortable button-down or as a fashion-forward, oversized number over high-waisted fitted pants and crop tops for a range of versatile looks.""Millennial pink"" hit the ramp in 2016, and the fashion world was suddenly ripe for all things bright and colourful. Vibrant shades stole the show everywhere, from Amal Clooney's Gen Z Yellow, to Melodramatic Purple and Safety Orange as seen on Marc Jacobs and Calvin Kleins. However, none survived the critical glare of fashion and colour experts.Shot down for either being too summer-y or simply not syncing right with autumn, trend forecasters are now placing their bets on bright green as the hue for the season. However, if one looks at the trend charts, it seems as if any colour, other than the drab black, is being preferred, for coats, skirts, and all other clothing articles this fall."
/sports/cricket/news/shakibs-70-vain-tigers-lose-against-nz-3140696,Shakib’s 70 in vain as Tigers lose against NZ,"Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan scored a fifty but a 200-plus target still proved to be too much for the Tigers as they suffered a 48-run defeat against hosts New Zealand in the T20I Tri-nation series at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Wednesday. The defeat also saw Bangladesh crash out of the T20I tri-nation series with three losses on the trot as New Zealand and Pakistan make it to the final, scheduled to be held at the same venue on Friday. Unlike the other two matches that Tigers lost in this series, Bangladesh batters were able to show intent in their chase of a 209-run target today. Shakib, in particular, looked to be in good touch during his 44-ball 70.However, despite Shakib's knock, Bangladesh were restricted to 160 for seven as they lacked the firepower at the death that is required to get over the line while in chase of such a big target.  The Tigers' team management faced backlash for having Shakib come down at number seven in their previous game in the series against New Zealand, which the Tigers lost by eight wickets. Coming at number four today, Shakib looked to be bold and innovative throughout his innings. The left-hander made his intentions clear right from the word go as he got off the mark by charging down the ground to hit Michael Bracewell for a boundary off the very first ball he faced. He hit a total of eight boundaries and one maximum and also starred in a 43-run stand with Soumya Sarkar, who scored 17-ball 23 in his first game for Bangladesh in over 11 months. Chasing a huge total, Bangladesh managed to get a positive start. Liton Das looked good during his 16-ball 23 as the Tigers amassed 52 for two wickets in the Powerplay. Shakib tried to keep the Tigers in the game but Bangladesh failed to match the tempo as the required rate skyrocketed over 18 an over at one point of the game. For New Zealand, pacer Adam Milne led the attack as he finished with figures of three for 24 in four overs. Earlier, a 40-ball 64 from Devon Conway and another rapid 24-ball 60 from Glenn Phillips helped New Zealand post 208 for five -- only the fifth time that a score above 200 was set at this venue.

/business/economy/news/bb-relaxes-rules-borrowing-exporters-3140446,BB relaxes rules on borrowing to exporters,"Bangladesh Bank yesterday said businesses that export goods guaranteed by reputed export credit agencies (ECAs) will be able to enjoy loans as per their need, even if it goes beyond the single borrower exposure limit.As per the single borrower exposure limit, banks are not allowed to give out loans that are more than 25 per cent of their capital to a single person, entity or business group.However, exporters who supply goods guaranteed by ECAs that are AAA rated by globally accepted credit rating agencies can now avail of loans beyond the single-borrower exposure limit.ECAs offer finance and other services to facilitate international trade.As such, most countries have ECAs that provide loans, loan guarantees and insurance to help eliminate the uncertainty involved in importing and exporting with other countries.In addition, the purpose of an ECA is to support the domestic economy and employment by helping companies find overseas markets for their products.An official of Bangladesh Bank said there is less risk in exporting products when the shipment is guaranteed by a reputed ECA.This is because the ECA will pay exporters for their goods even if the foreign buyer is unable to do so and for this reason, loans given by banks to exporters will not create any risk, he added.Fazlul Hoque, a former president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said this is a welcome initiative as it will help exporters manage their required funds.However, he reckons that complexity may be created as exporters usually make shipments to different buyers at the same time.Besides, there is a possibility that some importers who source goods from the domestic market will be able to manage guarantees from reputed ECAs while others may fail to do so.""Under such a situation, banks may face ambiguity in disbursing loans to exporters,"" Hoque said, adding that the BB should clarify the issue through another notice.As per existing central bank norms, the single borrower exposure limit is also not applicable to the loans given to the government or companies that have managed payment guarantees from the government.In addition, borrowers that have got guarantees from multilateral development banks are also permitted to enjoy loans beyond the limit."

/news/bangladesh/news/fy23-growth-bangladesh-imf-lowers-forecast-6pc-3140276,FY23 growth for Bangladesh: IMF lowers forecast to 6pc,"The International Monetary Fund has cut Bangladesh's growth forecast to 6 percent for fiscal year 2022-2023.In its latest World Economic Outlook report published yesterday, the Washington-based lender downgraded the projection of its April forecast of 6.7 percent growth citing high energy and food prices, inflation, higher interest rates, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.It said inflation in Bangladesh would reach as high as 8.5 percent in the current fiscal year.The IMF's projection is in the same tune as that of the World Bank.On Thursday, the World Bank also slashed the gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for Bangladesh for the current fiscal year to 6.1 percent from 6.7 percent because of inflation, energy shortage, slowdown of the recovery from the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine.Last month, the Asian Development Bank also cut its projection for Bangladesh's GDP growth to 6.6 percent for this fiscal year from 7.1 percent.The government, meanwhile, has an ambitious target of 7.5 percent.However, some leading economists of the country expressed doubt about whether the country would be able to attain even IMF's slashed projection.Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, said the lingering effect of the economic downtrend was not reflected in the IMF forecast.The economist said the crisis just started when the IMF team visited the country three months ago. Back then, it was thought that the situation could stabilise soon.""But it did not stabilise,"" he said, adding, ""Given the continuing uncertainty in the balance of payment, faltering export performance, declining remittances, and rapidly worsening power situation, it would be great if we can achieve 6 percent.""According to the IMF forecast for other South Asian countries, the GDP of India would grow by 6.1 percent in FY23, the Maldives by 6.1 percent, Bhutan 4.3 percent, Nepal 5 percent, Pakistan 3.5 percent, and Sri Lanka's GDP would shrink 3 percent.In its report, the IMF trimmed its 2023 global GDP forecast to 2.7 percent, 0.2 points down from the July forecast.Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the editor of the IMF Economic Review, warned that more than a third of the global economy is headed for contraction this year or next, and the three biggest economies -- the United States, European Union and China -- will continue to stall.""The worst is yet to come and, for many people 2023 will feel like a recession,"" said Gourinchas.Former lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office Zahid Hussain said, ""The 6 percent GDP growth projection for FY23 is similar to the forecast from other international agencies … Nature has not been kind to agriculture this year while energy and electricity shortages show little sign of alleviation. The increased prices of raw materials and intermediate inputs also have contractionary effects.""Domestic demand is likely to be compressed due to historic high inflation. External demand conditions are likely to get worse. The GDP contracted in the first half of 2022 in the US and a contraction in the second half of 2022 in the eurozone is imminent. These indicate significant headwinds for our exports. Remittances through formal channels have started to slow down since mid-September despite a surge in the number of Bangladeshi workers going abroad in the last year and a half.""A 6 percent growth, if achieved, will in fact be outstanding at a time when global growth forecast is at 2.7 percent in 2023, in emerging and developing Asia at 4.9 percent, Latin America and the Caribbean 1.7 percent, Middle East and Central Asia 3.6 percent and Sub-Saharan Africa 3.7 percent. About a third of the world economies are facing two consecutive quarters of GDP decline.""The message here is not to take anything for granted. Intensifying structural reforms to improve productivity and ease of trading internally and externally would ease supply constraints. At the same time, getting the external deficit under control will be critical to ensure the adequacy of foreign exchange availability."""

Despite severe criticism of his role in ensuring quality of Wasa services, he was reappointed for the sixth term."

/life-living/travel/news/your-complete-guide-visiting-the-sundarbans-3140886,Your complete guide to visiting the Sundarbans ,"The Sundarbans is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places in Bangladesh, and easily one of the best tourist attractions in the country. This mangrove forest is the largest in the world, and is densely populated with various trees, and diverse wildlife. This time of the year — from October to March —is best to visit this treasure trove of natural beauty as the weather is perfect, not too warm with low chances of rain or storm. But how do we get there and what's there to see? This article shall serve as your guide.       Here are the top 5 places to visit in the Sundarbans.Located in the southeast corner of the Sundarbans, this clean, beautiful, and serene beach is often interrupted by tiger roars. The sandy beach is spotted with red crabs and the area contains three tiger hills. It is also a great base for safaris, and bird-watching. If you are lucky, you may even spot a Royal Bengal Tiger! Apart from these, from a historical aspect, remnants of salt cultivation from the British period can still be found here.Hiron Point is the prime spot from where the diverse wildlife of the Sundarbans can be explored. It is a protected sanctuary for wildlife, and visitors can take a walk through the long wooden walkway to explore the various species of monkeys, deer, and reptiles. There is also a rest house near Hiron Point, the Neelkomol.  Kachikhali will give you a scope to absorb the raw natural beauty of the Sundarbans and feel the essence of the wildlife sanctuary located there. It is situated 14km east of Kotka and features a dense forest facing the Bay of Bengal. It is populated with numerous marine and land creatures that one can see. Kachikhali is also known as Tiger Point and has a rest house.   Karamjal is another place that is known for its dense population of wildlife. It is a popular tourist spot where people come to see the various species of wildlife roaming about the Sundarbans. This place is also used as the Deer Breeding Centre and Wildlife Reserving Centre. You can take a look at the diverse wildlife including dolphins, crocodiles, deer, wild boars, ducks, monkeys, and the majestic tigers.   Dublar Chor is a highly popular island in the Sundarbans, owing to its various types of fish, festivities, and breath-taking sunsets. Almost half of the year, this island remains submerged underwater. During the third week of November, under the full moon, the Hindu community observes their holy festival, Rash Mela, and devotees from all over the country come to join. However, this holy occasion is no longer open for tourists. How to go?
It is not practicable to go to the Sundarbans directly from Dhaka, although there were a few ships that used to take this route in the past, but now they are mostly halted or irregular. Moreover, choosing this method of travelling would stretch your trip to 5-6 days on a ship.
The easiest and most practiced method is to take a bus to Khulna or Mongla and then your trip provider will set you up on a ship. Although Khulna has better facilities in many ways, the completion of The Padma Bridge has made Mongla a popular docking point as well.
Alternatively, you can travel to Jessore by plane and then take a one-hour bus ride to Khulna. Most tour operators provide a 2-3 days tour and then drop guests back at the spot where they were received from. Furthermore, to visit the Sundarbans, a forest permit is required.     
Things to know
While visiting a forest, there are a few things you ought to keep in mind. Firstly, your attire must be light and simple, and bright colours should be avoided at any cost as they attract wildlife. Furthermore, perfumes cannot be worn.
Silence must be maintained at all times and people should walk in a straight line and stay together. Most importantly, visitors must have sharp eyes and stay vigilant all the time as many unprecedented mishaps can occur. Taking a dip in the water is prohibited and so is roaming about without the supervision of forest guards.

/business/news/eu-countries-seek-way-out-impasse-over-gas-price-caps-3140761,EU countries seek way out of impasse over gas price caps,"The question of how, when and whether to cap gas prices is set to dominate another meeting of European Union countries on Wednesday, as they pursue a joint plan to target high gas prices - a compromise that has eluded them for weeks.The 27-country EU is plotting its next move to tame soaring energy prices and shield consumers from surging bills, as Europe heads into a winter of scarce Russian gas, a cost of living crisis and the looming threat of recession.""We need to find a quick solution that will be applicable to all the European Union,"" a senior EU official said. ""National solutions are not a way forward.""EU energy ministers meet in Prague on Wednesday to attempt to provide clearer instructions on what the European Commission should propose as the bloc's next emergency energy measure.But countries still cannot decide what they want.With gas prices almost 90% higher than a year ago, most EU countries say they want a gas price cap, but disagree on its design. Some countries, including Germany, Europe's biggest gas market, remain opposed.Talks among EU leaders last week did little to clarify the next steps. Those discussions ""went in all directions"", one EU diplomat said - referring to the numerous options being floated, including a price cap on all gas, pipeline gas, or just gas used to produce electricity.Another EU diplomat said no ""unified signal"" had come out of the leaders' talks. ""I'd say expectations are low,"" the diplomat said of Wednesday's meeting.Others were more hopeful a consensus was emerging. The senior EU official said countries were leaning towards the ""Iberian model"" of capping the price of gas used for power generation as a quick fix.Spain and Portugal implemented that scheme in June, which helped curb local power prices. The idea has gained support among other countries, although some worry it could raise EU gas demand, since Spain's gas use increased under the measure.EU countries have already rushed through emergency energy windfall profit levies, gas storage filling obligations, and electricity demand curbs to address the surge in energy prices driven by Russia slashing gas supplies since it invaded Ukraine.But the pressure to agree more EU-wide measures has increased after Germany said it would spend up to 200 billion euros to shield its consumers and businesses from high energy costs - prompting a backlash from some countries about the uneven rollout of national support."

Especially, the Sultan likes the Black Bengal goat of Bangladesh.He said Brunei, which is heavily dependent on food imports, wants Bangladesh to provide expertise to Brunei in fish and agriculture, especially fish and shrimp.MoUs on these matters were also signed in 2019.Also, Brunei is an important member of ASEAN and Bangladesh is eager to become a sectoral dialogue partner to ASEAN as well as seek its support in Rohingya repatriation.""We hope for a fruitful visit by the Brunei Sultan.""President Abdul Hamid will receive the Brunei Sultan, his family members, cabinet members and officials at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on October 15.He will visit the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum at Dhaka's Dhanmondi 32 and National Martyrs' Memorial in Savar.The Sultan will hold meetings with President Abdul Hamid and attend a banquet hosted by the president.He will hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina."

That is just a part of T20.""The tournament's eighth edition begins on Sunday with Sri Lanka facing Namibia and UAE against Netherlands in a first qualifying round at Geelong, one of seven venues being used for the 45 matches.Games will also be held in Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Perth and Sydney, with the final on November 13 under lights at the cavernous Melbourne Cricket Ground.The top nations join on October 22 when Australia open their defence against Kane Williamson's New Zealand in Sydney -- a repeat of the 2021 final in Dubai where Mitchell Marsh's unbeaten 77 powered them to an eight-wicket win and maiden crown.Blockbuster clash Despite a couple of key absences India and England are the favourites along with Australia.England face fast-improving Afghanistan in Perth for their opener on October 22 but will be missing star batsman Johnny Bairstow after he suffered a serious leg injury in a ""freak accident"" on the golf course.A blockbuster clash follows 24 hours later in Melbourne when India take on arch-rivals and 2009 champions Pakistan, with more than 90,000 fans expected.India suffered a huge blow last week when pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was ruled out of the World Cup with a back injury, further depleting the stocks of a side that has lacked steam in the final overs of the T20 format.All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is also absent with a knee problem.While Rohit Sharma's side are ranked number one, they haven't lifted the T20 trophy since 2007 and failed to reach the semi-finals last year.""Areas of concerns, we have to look at our bowling, what more options we can find in the powerplay, middle and death,"" said swashbuckling opener Sharma, who along with run machine Virat Kohli will be key to their chances.""It will be challenging and we need to find answers, still working towards that.""England threat World number two England are also a big threat for a first title since 2010 and beat Australia in a warm-up match on Sunday.They are in Australia on the back of a 4-3 triumph in Pakistan, a series in which captain Jos Buttler attended but played no part as he recovered from a calf injury.He is though fit for the World Cup and insisted not playing had its benefits.""I've learned lots listening to the group and watching the way they go about things, watching without as much emotion as when you are involved and thinking about what you will do at certain times,"" he told reporters.The West Indies are the only two-time champions -- in 2012 and 2016 -- but in a shock failed to automatically qualify for the Super 12 stage because they were outside the top-eight-ranked ICC teams at the time.It means they play the first round of the 16-nation tournament despite now being ranked seven.Nicholas Pooran captains an inexperienced side after Andre Russell was overlooked and a slew of veterans called time on their international careers.They are paired with Scotland, Ireland and Zimbabwe and kick off against the Scots on October 17.Recently crowned Asian champions Sri Lanka are in the same boat despite now being ranked eight and are grouped with Namibia, Netherlands and UAE in the preliminaries.The top two from each group join the Super 12 nations -- England, New Zealand, Australia and Afghanistan in Group 1; India, Pakistan, South Africa and Bangladesh in Group 2.

/star-literature/news/clifton-beach-3141091,Clifton Beach,"The summer breeze was more than calming on me, as I lay on a small floral bed sheet on the beach of Clifton. It was 3.00 p.m. So the beach was almost empty. People throng on the beach early in the morning or in the evening when the sun isn't high up in the sky.I had no option as I was in Karachi for an official meeting. I had to catch the plane to Lahore, early in the morning, the next day. I had heard so much about the Clifton beach that I couldn't resist going there.The sweet smell of jasmine flowers came wafting in the soft breeze. My eyes closed, I tried to compose a poem.What's that?A feeble sound reached my ears. Was I day dreaming? The sound of anklets nearby made me sit up. I looked around but couldn't see anything. An eerie feeling crept on me. The rhythm grew stronger as if it was just beside me. A cold shiver passed through my spine. I looked around. No one was there. Slowly the rhythm started moving away and then it stopped. I felt relief. It was getting dark as the sky was flooding with grey clouds. I picked up the bed sheet to leave.Wait!Muffled crying of a child reached my ears. It was coming from a Peepal tree near which the music of anklets had receded. A small little baby was lying on the ground and crying. First I decided not to go there but as the child kept crying. As I reached near, I was surprised to see a very healthy baby. The pink cheeks and fair skin were evidence enough that the baby was well fed. The dress and the blanket that the baby was wrapped in were very expensive.Who on earth could have left the baby here? I wondered.The beach was deserted. I noticed that it was almost past dusk. But the full moon in the sky shone brightly and played hide and seek amidst the clouds. I thought for a while whether I should take the baby with me or not.  As I stood there, the baby smiled at me and started cooing as if conversing with me.How could I just leave the baby there! I decided to take the child to the nearby police station.I picked up the baby and started walking. Suddenly, a woman's cackling laughter flooded the air. It was coming from the same peepal tree. Terrified, I looked at the tree and I thought that I saw a woman with dark flowing hair and her legs hanging from the tree. But I saw her only for a moment and then she was gone.The first thought that came to my mind was to run and save the baby. I started running. As I ran, I felt the baby grow heavier. The weight was becoming unbearable. I was in shock so I hadn't noticed the baby in my hands. I tried to hold the baby closer and that is when I noticed the baby's feet were getting longer and reaching my ankles.I fainted.When I woke up, I was in my room. My friend who had accompanied me from office in the morning was sitting on the sofa. ""What happened?"" He asked""You won't believe it.""""Really? Try me.""With apprehension, that he won't believe me, I started to tell him what had happened. I was sweating and trembling in fear.He smiled and said, ""You need some water. Wait""As I waited he stretched his hands towards the refrigerator. It was becoming longer and longer like a plastic pipe.I lost consciousness.As I opened my eyes, I was lying on the beach. The moon's light shone on the waves like sparkling diamonds. Heavy grey clouds were assembling in the sky.Something cold just touched the nape of my neck. I dared not look back. I could feel someone or something breathing behind me and the scent of jasmine flowers.Can you smell it too....?Tasneem Hossain is a multilingual poet, columnist, op ed columnist and training consultant.

/sports/cricket/news/malan-hits-82-england-beat-australia-eight-runs-3140981,Malan hits 82 as England beat Australia by eight runs,"Dawid Malan's 82 and disciplined bowling from England helped the visitors win the second Twenty20 international against Australia by eight runs Wednesday to seal the series and give them a confidence boost heading into the World Cup.Malan shared a crucial 92-run stand in Canberra with Moeen Ali (44) as England compiled 178-7 against a full-strength Australian attack.Despite Mitchell Marsh hitting 45 off 29 balls and Tim David 40 off 23, the hosts fell short.Sam Curran took 3-25 to ensure England won the three-match series 2-0 with a game left on Friday in a setback to the World Cup champions.""Really satisfying win after losing the toss as well and setting a target,"" said England skipper Jos Buttler.""I think we showed great character and Malan played fantastically well to anchor the innings.""Malan hit seven fours and four sixes in his 49-ball knock to rescue the visitors after they slumped to 54-4 in the ninth over.Ali was also impressive after Australian captain Aaron Finch won the toss and chose to bowl, making five changes to the side that also lost by eight runs in Perth.Pace spearheads Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, along with spinner Adam Zampa all returned for the hosts after being rested for the first T20.Buttler fell to Cummins on 17, with Zampa holding a difficult high catch.Alex Hales, who blasted 84 from 51 balls in Perth, lasted just seven balls for his four runs before holing out to David Warner off Marcus Stoinis.Star allrounder Ben Stokes' ordinary recent form continued, bowled by Zampa for seven, and when Harry Brook got an edge off Stoinis they were on the back foot at 54-4.But Malan was rock-solid, expertly finding the gaps to reach his 14th half-century.Zampa finally broke the partnership, tempting Ali into another big hit and he was caught on the ropes before a late flurry from Malan, who was out in the last over.""We were really poor in the field, sloppy, dropped a couple of chances, especially when we had them four down in the first 10 overs,"" said Finch.England rested pacemen Mark Wood and Chris Woakes but they still found a way to restrict Australia.Finch dropped down the order in recent matches, but returned to partner Warner for the first time since their Sri Lanka tour in the middle of the year.But he never settled and again fell cheaply, out for 13.Warner, who has been in form, followed three balls later for four to leave Australia struggling at 22-2 in the fifth over.Glenn Maxwell's recent poor form continued, out for eight, before Marsh and Marcus Stoinis put on a quick-fire 40-run partnership to keep them in contention.Stoinis went for 22, followed by Marsh, with Australia's fate resting with David and Matthew Wade. They needed 59 of the last five overs but were unable to deliver the fireworks required.

/news/bangladesh/news/inflation-rings-alarm-bells-3140271,Inflation rings alarm bells,"People in rural areas were hit harder by food and non-food inflation than those in urban areas over the last two months, with the overall inflation surging to a 10-year high of 9.52 percent in August.It, however, fell to 9.10 percent in September, but people in rural areas continued to feel the pinch as non-food inflation was close to 10 percent that month, according to data released by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) yesterday.Inflation has been on an upward trend over the past several months due to higher food prices amid global supply chain disruptions and uncertainties stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war.Planning Minister MA Mannan gave the inflation data at a briefing at the Planning Commission yesterday.Usually, the BBS publishes inflation figures of a month in the first week of the following month. But it delayed the release of the inflation data for August and September as it did not receive ""green signal"" from the government, said planning ministry officials.According to the data, food inflation soared to 9.94 percent in August -- the highest since April of 2012 -- and decreased slightly to 9.08 percent in September.On the other hand, non-food inflation was 8.85 percent in August but jumped to 9.13 percent in September.In rural areas, the overall inflation was 9.70 percent in August whereas it was 9.18 percent in urban areas.Besides, food inflation was 9.98 percent in rural areas in August compared to 9.87 percent in urban areas.Zahid Hussain, former lead economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office, said, ""The two-percentage point increase in inflation in August compared to July was a direct result of energy price increases and perhaps the exchange rate depreciation. Increased transport costs drove up food prices across the country while exchange rate depreciation increased the cost of imports.""In July, inflation was 7.48 percent.Inflation declined in September, thanks to a slight drop in prices of some food items. However, food inflation was still 0.9 percentage points higher than that in July and 3.9 percentage points higher than that in September last year, he said.Zahid further said non-food inflation increased further in September this year, suggesting that the inflationary momentum has not dissipated yet.""Domestic supply shocks are continuing with power outages and gas shortages disrupting domestic production. The consequent productivity slowdown will fuel inflationary momentum … A prolonged drought has adversely affected Aman cultivation.""No single policy intervention can be adequate under circumstances like these,"" he said, suggesting that supply management needs to be prioritised with food and energy security at the top.He also stressed the need for the protection of vulnerable groups to alleviate the burden of the cost-of-living escalation.""The government's laudable initiative to subsidise food to 10 million poor families through Family Cards must continue, be scaled up, and better targeted,"" he added.Ahsan H Mansur, executive director at the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, said the high inflation is a result of global uncertainties.""Inflation is also high in other countries in Europe and the US…""We had anticipated that the inflation rate would be higher.""Asked about inflation in rural areas, Mansur said the markets in urban areas are usually less volatile than those in rural areas.The prices of commodities in rural markets, especially the small ones, shoot up all of a sudden, he added.At the briefing, Planning Minister MA Mannan said Bangladesh, like other countries, is facing problems due to the ongoing global volatility… there will be no food crisis in the country if the agricultural production remains good.The government is trying its best, he said, urging consumers to spend money judiciously.""We have to save foodgrains, money, electricity and water. At the same time, we should prevent wastage,"" he said.Shamsul Alam, state minister for planning, said inflation rose not just in Bangladesh, but also in other countries such as India, the UK, and the US.Inflation here is now at a tolerable level, he claimed."

Please don't lose patience and fall into any trap. Don't be incited by an any provocation,"" Khasru called upon the party leaders and activists.The BNP leader was speaking at a press conference at the party office at Nasiman Bhaban on the city's Nur Ahmad Road.Party sources said leaders and activists from Chattogram's adjacent districts have already started reaching the city to join the rally. The work on setting up the stage at the venue was going on yesterday.Khasru said BNP men will show up for the rally braving all hurdles and harassment.""Despite lots of problems and pressure, our leaders and activists have been working to make the grand rally a success. No one will be able to stop the rush of the people towards the rally venue,"" said the senior BNP leader.The opposition party earlier alleged that many cases were filed against the party leaders and activists since it started organising protests across the country in late July.Asked about the ruling party leaders' warning of resisting violence by BNP, Khasru yesterday said, ""According to the country's constitution, only the law enforcement agencies can do the job of maintaining law and order and no party can do it. The law enforcement agencies should carry out their duties properly so that no one can take any advantage.""He said the BNP has already asked its leaders and activists to hold the rally peacefully.""We do politics for the people, and the people's strength is much more than that of sticks, rifles or sharp weapons. We don't need any weapons as people are with us. Those who are isolated from the people try to do politics with sticks.""Party Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir will address the rally as chief guest. Senior leaders of the party will also be present.The opposition party held its last meeting at the Polo ground on January 9, 2012, when party Chairperson Khaleda Zia addressed the rally.BNP sources said the leaders and activists have been instructed to travel to the rally venue in groups to avoid arrest or harassment. They have also been advised not to carry any sticks.Police sources said a large number of law enforcers, both uniformed and plainclothes, and members of a crisis response team will be deployed in and around the venue to avert any untoward situation.On Monday, AL leaders warned that the BNP would be resisted if it indulged in violence in the name of holding any rally.""We hope that the BNP will hold their rally peacefully and that's why we did not schedule any programme for that day. We have seen earlier that they committed violence and engaged in anti-state activities in the name of holding programmes. If such incidents take place, we will resist,"" Moslem Uddin Ahmed, president of the Chattogram South unit AL, said at a press conference.AJM Nasir Uddin, city AL general secretary, said party leaders and activists would remain alert to any possible violence by the BNP and would resist it.Meanwhile, AL General Secretary Obaidul Quader, also the road transport and bridges minister, yesterday said his party was ready to face the BNP on the streets and in elections.""BNP leaders are still daydreaming about the fall of the government and making ridiculous statements demanding the government's resignation,"" he said at a press briefing at his Secretariat office.He said the AL had been on the streets, it is still there now, and will remain on the street in future.Quader said the BNP's dream of waging a movement to oust the government by ""capitalising on the people's sufferings caused by the ongoing global crisis"" would not come true."

Each union is separated into three blocks where field officers are looking after farmers' needs, he said.Forty-four individuals and organisations have won Bangabandhu Jatiya Krishi Award 2018 and 2019 for their contribution to the agriculture sector.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will be present virtually at the prize-giving ceremony that will be held today at the Osmani Smriti Auditorium.Veterinary surgeon of Department of Livestock of Bogura Md Raihan, Upazila Agriculture Officer Shafiqul Islam and a farmer Amirul Islam of Pabna have won gold medals.Raihan won for creating public awareness and encouraging farmers through publicity and publication.Shafiqul won for inventing environment friendly technology for agriculture and Amirul for success in farming cattle and poultry commercially.According to the Agriculture Ministry, Silver medals recipients are – Badrul Haidar of Pirojpur, Hamidul Haque, upazila nirbahi officer (UAO) of Kishoreganj; Sharmin Aktar of Jhenaidah, Dulal Mridha of Pabna, Kobbad Hossain of Savar, Moniruzzaman Monir of Rajshahi, Muhammad Rakibul Ahsan Rony of Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area, Ayub Hossain, UAO of Jashore; Halima Begum of Khulna, Nasrin Sultana of Jashore, Abdul Hai Azad Babla of Sylhet, Saiful Islam; deputy director of Madaripur Horticulture Center, Rafiqul Islam of Jhenaidah, Abul Hossain Sardar of Khulna, Babul Hossain of Narayanganj and Paramount Agro Limited.Awardees who will receive Bronze medals are: Nur Mohammad of Rajshahi, Barek Hawladar of Pirojpur, Mozidul Islam of Rangpur, Shafiqul Islam of Narayanganj, Goutam Kumar Saha of Naogaon, Purnima Begum of Rajshahi, Mahbubar Rahman, former UAO of Dinajpur; Moqbul Hossain of Jhenaidah, Sahidul Islam of Sirajganj, Hlashing Mong Chowdhury of Khagrachhari, Gazi Mamud of Mymensingh, Mahbubul Islam of Sirajganj, Rina Begum of Tangail, Momrez Ali, UAO of Natore; Rostom Ali, UAO of Sirajganj; Md Shahinuzzaman of Pabna, Tou Yo Mro of Bandarban, Mojibul Haque of Feni, Siraj Khan of Munshiganj, Sanwar Hossain of Tangail, Abdul Awal of Rangamati, Shakil Mia of Gaibandha, Tonima Afrin of Narail and Rakhi De of Dinajpur.  Nipu Traders of Dhaka's Nawabganj get awards under organisation category."

He smashed three fours and one maximum during his cameo knock that came to an end in the sixth over when he holed out to the fielder at deep midwicket off a Michael Bracewell delivery. Shanto, who had been riding his luck from the beginning, was the first to fall. Trying to play an Adam Milne delivery across the line, Shanto was beaten for pace as he lost his stumps in the fourth over.  The left-hander charged down the track to hit Trent Boult in the third delivery of the very first over but despite a top edge, the ball went on to fall in between four fielders as Shanto survived a scare even before opening his account. Just a delivery before he was dismissed, Shanto was dropped on 10 as he tried to hit Milne over the mid-on for a boundary.

/business/global-economy/news/eu-thirst-lng-puts-bangladesh-pakistan-the-dark-3140426,"EU thirst for LNG puts Bangladesh, Pakistan in the dark","LNG has plugged a gap in Europe's energy mix since it became imperative to move away from Russian energy. However, overall export capacity for LNG has not changed meaning some countries are now getting less than before.European countries have already bought more liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2022 than in any year previously. The surge in demand followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with various European governments rushing to end their dependence on Russian energy as quickly as possible.In the nine months from January to September, European nations' demand for LNG rose dramatically according to data provided to DW by the analytics group ICIS. Demand in France rose by 88 per cent compared with the same period in 2021, the Netherlands by 109 per cent and Belgium by 157 per cent.However, Europe's thirst for LNG is having negative consequences for countries in other parts of the world which already import the super-chilled fuel in large volumes. Prices are soaring and less LNG is up for grabs on the market, making it a much less viable option for poorer countries.""The way in which Europe has been able to source these volumes is by paying more than other markets are willing to pay for,"" Alex Munton, an LNG analyst with energy research group Rapidan, told DW.The ICIS figures confirm the extent to which LNG demand has fallen in countries outside of Europe, particularly in Asia. In Bangladesh, demand is down 10 per cent compared with 2021, in Pakistan it's down 19 per cent while in China there is a 22 per cent drop.Blackouts hit hardThe consequences for certain countries are stark. Last week, Bangladesh suffered its worst blackouts in almost a decade with more than 100 million people left without power for several hours. For months, Bangladesh has been struggling to secure enough gas on global markets.Mohammad Tamin from BRAC University in Dhaka says the blackouts in Bangladesh are connected to energy shortages although a bigger reason is that the national electricity grid needs to be updated.""Mostly it's a system operating challenge,"" he told DW. ""The independent system operation has not been updated, and we need a smart grid because larger power plants are coming in.""Nonetheless, he said countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and India have been significantly affected by the changes to the LNG market in 2022.""Europe is trying to grab every molecule of gas wherever it is available,"" he said. ""They are purchasing everything from current to future gas. And their purchasing power is much higher than that of developing countries. So obviously, countries like Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan have been hit very hard.""Pakistan is in the midst of a severe energy crisis and last week it emerged that it had failed to attract a single bid from suppliers for a tender to supply one cargo of LNG per month for between 4 and 6 years. For months, Pakistan has also struggled to buy LNG on the shorter-term spot markets.One of the big problems countries such as Pakistan have faced in terms of LNG supply is the nature of the contracts they have signed with suppliers.Pakistan has signed contracts with trading companies which may not necessarily produce the LNG themselves. The contracts often include break clauses, meaning the suppliers can sell the LNG to other markets if they wish at short notice. They must pay a penalty in that case.However, soaring LNG prices elsewhere mean they can easily pay the penalty and still make substantial profits by selling in the more profitable market.An LNG tanker at the Ras Laffan Industial City in Qatar.""You've got a huge disconnect and a huge opportunity if you're a trading company, to say, 'well, we did have a sales contract into Pakistan and we were going to get maybe a price that was linked to the price of oil...but we can pay a break clause and route it into Europe',"" Munton explains.""So, it's well worth paying that penalty because the alternative market is so lucrative. And that's been what's happening.""Pakistan's problemPakistan's inability to buy enough fuel means power shortages are likely to become a longer-term reality in the country. The government says it does not have a shortage of fuel, but it has brought in several measures to try and reduce fuel consumption across the country.It is a major threat to an economy already under severe pressure. At the end of August, the IMF approved a $1.1 billion (€1.13 billion) bailout for Pakistan.For Bangladesh, energy worries threaten its strong economic growth. Growth forecasts for the country have been cut sharply in recent months.""That is principally because of the energy shortage,"" said Mohammad Tamin. ""It's affecting the garments industry quite severely. Especially textile and spinning sectors are in trouble due to power cuts and gas shortages. Because of the lack of gas, they are unable to run the factories regularly. There are a lot of interruptions, especially in batch productions. If there is an interruption, the whole batch gets destroyed.""No new capacity yetThe pressures in the global LNG market are not going to let up any time soon, according to Munton. European demand will remain strong but there will be little additional LNG export capacity for several years.""If the world suddenly needs more LNG, or if there are certain markets like Europe that suddenly need more LNG, they can't make more total supply happen,"" he said. ""They can only source more by taking away or by resulting in other countries consuming less. There's a fixed amount of supply in the world.""Heavy investment in LNG means significant new capacity is expected to come on stream over the next four years, but until then, competition for the fuel will continue to leave some countries out in the cold."

The school's students and children of Laldighi and adjacent areas use this ground for recreation.While visiting the ground last week, this correspondent saw four sides of the ground covered with corrugated tins.""For two years, we could not play here,"" said Hasan Al Baker, a ninth grader of  KC Dey Road area.""Many rallies during the Liberation War were held in Laldighi. It's also a place where Bangabandhu addressed rallies,"" said seventy-year-old Tapos Mitra.""I'm glad that the government took the initiative to renovate this ground. However, I also think that the ground should be open to the children soon,"" he said.To commemorate the declaration of six-point demand by Bangabandhu, a stage, named ""Chhoy Dafa Mancha"" has been built on the ground.There are also 18 terracotta artworks depicting historic moments that the country witnessed. There are also many portraits of historical figures, and a temporary Shaheed Minar.Besides, there's also a sitting arrangement, walkway and a park zone for children.Contacted, Pradip Kumar Sarkar, EED executive engineer, Chattogram, said 36 benches have been set up on the ground along with a 368-metre walkway.Asked when the ground would be inaugurated, Pradip said, ""Higher officials may know about the exact date.""Contacted, Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury Nowfel, deputy minister for education, said the prime minister is scheduled to inaugurate the field on October 17. ""It was scheduled to be opened on October 2, but we didn't receive a confirmation,"" he said.  "
/business/economy/news/freight-forwarders-seek-bonded-warehouses-handle-export-cargoes-3140431,Freight forwarders seek bonded warehouses to handle export cargoes,"The government should allow freight forwarders to set up and run bonded warehouse facilities with a view to handling export and import cargoes smoothly, said Bangladesh Freight Forwarders Association (BAFFA) Vice President Khairul Alam Suzan. ""If freight forwarders are permitted to operate bonded warehouses or cargo freight stations (CFSs), the current reliance on the inland container depots in handling 100 per cent of the export cargoes would be reduced.""""This will also pave the way for the elimination of the congestion at the Chattogram port,"" he said.The BAFFA leader urged the government to lease out 100 acres of area in the proposed Bay Terminal so that they can develop a modern distribution park there on their own to handle import and export cargoes.The freight forwarding segment is a major part of the country's logistics sector, representing all activities of import and export transportation services covering sea, air, rail, river, and land.Currently, more than 1,100 members of the BAFFA are facilitating the country's more than $130 billion of foreign trade.In an interview with The Daily Star recently, Suzan said there was a space shortage at the cargo freight stations in the private inland container depots (ICDs).As a result, ICDs can't make room for export cargoes on time in their CFSs and vehicles carrying export cargoes from factories located in various parts of the country very often have had to wait in queues for days outside the ICDs before they can enter the depots.""Due to the long wait, exporters have had to count additional vehicle fare,"" said Suzan.The situation worsens especially ahead of the Eid holidays when suppliers start sending export cargoes in higher volumes in advance since their factories remain shut for a longer period during the festival.""At that time, we have to prioritise the vehicles that are loaded with the goods scheduled to leave the port earlier than others.""The problem has emerged as the ICD owners have not made enough investments to enhance their capacity, according to Suzan.Almost all export-bound cargoes that are shipped through Chattogram port are stuffed into containers at the CFS of the 19 ICDs in and around the port city.BM Container Depot, one of the ICDs, has been operating partially since June when a deadly fire tore through it. Currently, it is handling empty containers, rather than any export and import ones.Suzan said currently, there is no alternative to the ICDs to handle export cargoes. So, he emphasised creating an alternative to process them in order to keep the country's export up and running.Suzan said container ports around the world operate as terminal operators only, not as storage facility providers. They also are not involved in cargo delivery.But the Chattogram Port Authority is engaged in storing import containers and facilitating delivery from the port, causing congestion as well as posing security risks as thousands of trucks and workers enter the country's largest seaport every day, he said.""So, even if vessel congestion at Chattogram port is eliminated, shipments still might be delayed if we can't load export cargoes into containers in a timely manner."" "
/business/economy/news/trading-govt-bonds-takes-place-3140441,Trading of govt bonds takes place,"The trading of treasury bonds and bills took place on the stock exchanges of Bangladesh yesterday, a day after their debut. There are about 270 treasury bonds worth more than Tk 2.5 lakh crore with their tenures ranging from two years to 20 years, data from the Bangladesh Bank showed.Of them, 222 treasury bonds were listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) as of August, with a combined value of Tk 59,359 crore. But they were not traded like shares and mutual fund units and they could be bought and sold only over the counter.But it changed for the better on Monday as the BSEC allowed treasury bills and bonds to be traded like stocks and mutual fund units, albeit on a trial basis.No items, however, could change hands on the exchanges because of a technical glitch on the day. Data migration could not be completed on time so trading was not possible although there were some buy orders, said the DSE.But several treasury bonds were traded on the DSE and the Chittagong Stock Exchange yesterday.Thanks to the commencement of the trading of government securities, Bangladesh has taken a major leap forward by making them easily available to investors through the exchanges and diversifying the product base.However, the lot of the bonds is 1,000 with a face value of Tk 100 means investors need to pay at least Tk 1 lakh or above to buy a single set of securities. As a result, small investors did not show much interest in buying them.While stocks are ownership in a company, bonds are a loan to a company or government. Because they are a loan, with a set interest payment, a maturity date, and a face value that the borrower will repay, they tend to be far less volatile than stocks. "

It was only the fifth time at this ground that a score above 200 has been made, meaning it would be a very difficult task for the Tigers who already have major concerns in their batting department.There were hardly any moments to cherish for the Tigers since they won the toss and opted to field. Conway and Finn Allen gave the Kiwis a flying start as they mustered 45 runs for the opening stand. Even though Shoriful Islam removed Allen after a quick-fire 19-ball 32, laced with two sixes and three boundaries, that could not tame the Kiwis. Conway then starred in another 82-run stand with Martin Guptill to help the hosts on course for a big total. At the death, it was some lusty blows from Phillips that saw New Zealand take the score past the 200-run mark. Phillips, who batted at a staggering 250 strike rate, smashed a total of five sixes and two boundaries.  How bleak of a day the Bangladesh bowlers had could be gauged from the fact that five of the six bowlers used today -- skipper Shakib Al Hasan, Ebadot Hossain, Shoriful Islam, Mosaddek Hossain, and Soumya Sarkar -- all conceded more than 10 runs an over. Saifuddin, who picked up two wickets, also had an economy rate of 9.25.

/shout/news/should-rickshaws-be-restricted-main-roads-3141096,Should rickshaws be restricted on main roads?,"In 2019, the city corporations made the decision to ban rickshaws from three major roads in Dhaka. The reason? To manage and reduce traffic congestion. Here we are, three years later, and the traffic has not yet improved. In fact, it has taken a drastic turn for the worse in recent times. It is easy to see where the government got the idea of banning rickshaws. The roads of this city are not wide enough to have space for separate lanes for different kinds of vehicles. As a result, the thoroughfares almost always witness traffic filled with a mixture of cars, buses, rickshaws, cycles, CNGs, etc.While motorised vehicles are more or less able to match in speed and performance, rickshaws, being man-driven, are slower. Vehicles of different capacities being on the same roads like this can be seen as a hindrance to traffic flow. It might even be accused of being a cause of the breakdown of traffic discipline, and the overall haphazard and dangerous driving habits that we see on the roads. However, what other option is there? The reason why rickshaws are so popular and occupy the roads to such a degree is that they are the best transport method for a large majority. The public transport system in our country is unreliable at best and for many, CNGs are only affordable if one has to make a long commute. Not only that, the deplorable conditions of the sidewalks make Dhaka an unwalkable city.In truth, banning rickshaws or even restricting them to alleyways is not a feasible option at all. Most of these alleys are uncomfortably narrow and barely allow a file of rickshaws to pass through without becoming blocked. They are battered as a result of poor planning and rough use, and there is hardly any proper repair done to them. It is cruel to ask rickshaw-pullers to drive only through these alleys.Furthermore, taking the convoluted routes through alleyways will most likely consume more of the rickshaw-pullers' time for each trip. However, since the destination is the same, their pay will continue to be the same as well. This will result in a disproportionate income for their labour. Many commuters will also probably face difficulties and opt for other methods of transport, once again impacting the livelihood of the rickshaw-pullers.During the Covid-19 pandemic, the income of these rickshaw-pullers plummeted drastically as a result of the decreased number of passengers and many had to rely on loans to make ends meet, particularly since no relief was offered to them. Moreover, the pandemic resulted in the loss of jobs in both rural and urban areas. Many of the people who lost these jobs are now taking up the job of pulling rickshaws in Dhaka. This in turn has led to further oversaturation in an already saturated market, thus, it is harder than ever for rickshaw-pullers to make a proper livelihood.From our privileged position, it is easy to opine on what should and should not be done. However, the people who are driving these rickshaws are in a different socioeconomic situation than us. Most of them cannot afford to entertain any ideas of such restrictions. Thus, unless a proper alternative mode of income can be found for these people and an alternative method of transport for commuters, restrictions simply cannot be imposed on rickshaws.Zaima is a struggling student, a failed guitarist and a poet in need of better poetic ideas.

/chattogram/news/fathers-fight-against-noise-pollution-3140576,A father’s fight against noise pollution,"Since last July, entrepreneur  Sujan Barua, a father of two, has been campaigning against noise pollution in different areas of Chattogram.He has arranged as many as 23 programmes during this time, which include awareness campaigns, sit-in protests and hunger strikes.His two children -- SSC candidate  Abhishek Barua and seventh grader daughter Chandrima Barua -- have occasionally accompanied him during these times.On August 17, Sujan tried to attract the attention of drivers by walking 10 kilometers with his son from the Chandgaon residential area to Agrabad.Besides, various programmes have been conducted to make drivers aware in New Market, GEC, Muradpur, Bahaddarhat, Dewanhat, Chowkbazar, Gate No-2, Tigerpass and other important areas of the port city.Recently, he staged a hunger strike for 21 hours at a stretch, from October 4 to October 6.But a lone protestor can only carry on for so long.  Sujan has been suffering from different diseases, including a severe cold since breaking the hunger strike.""I have become severely ill since the hunger strike. If the relevant authorities don't show any goodwill on tackling noise pollution, I'll go on hunger strike till death in the future,"" he told this correspondent.He said he is trying to make drivers aware about the negative impacts of noise pollution on the future generation.Sujan lamented that no one cared about his demands initially, but slowly some are relating to his cause and expressing their support.But the government departments concerned who are supposed to keep noise pollution under control are still indifferent towards his demands, he continued.Sujan believes the strict implementations of the existing laws can prevent noise pollution  in the country. "
/entertainment/tv-film/news/8-successful-films-the-last-12-years-3141061,8 successful films in the last 12 years,"There was a period when Bangladeshi cinema seemed hopeless, both as an art form and as an industry but in recent times, the Bangladeshi film industry is experiencing a new wave as most of the films that are being released are doing well at the box office commercially. Let us look at the films that did commercially well in the theatres from 2010 to 2022.After the success of ""Monpura"" directed by Giasuddin Selim in 2009, there were no such films that can attract the audience in theatres. The scene changed when Zakir Hossain Raju directorial ""Poramon"" was released in the theatres in 2013. The film featured debutants Symon Sadik and Mahiya Mahi, in the lead roles. This film paved the way for Mahiya Mahi in Dhallywood. Noted filmmaker Amitabh Reza Chowdhury directorial ""Aynabaji"" drew a fair amount of audience, particularly for its unique storyline, in the theatres in 2016. Based on the story by Gousul Alam Shaon (who also has an acting role), the film casts Partha Barua alongside Masuma Rahman Nabila and Chanchal Chowdhury, and is the story of a gifted actor, who slips in and out of personas at will.Bangladesh-India joint production ""Shikari"", which stars Dhallywood superstar Shakib Khan, did well at the box office, when it was released in 2016. Shakib's ragged look in this film has received raving appreciation from the audience. Action film ""Dhaka Attack"", was the most profitable cinema in 2017. It drew throngs of viewers to the halls that year. The film was directed by Dipankar Dipon and casts Arifin Shuvoo, Mahiya Mahi, and Taskin Ahmed in the lead roles. Taskin emerged as a villain in the film industry through this film. Raihan Rafi directorial ""Poramon 2"", the sequel of the film ""Poramon"" directed by Zakir Hossain Raju, garnered positive appreciation from the audience in 2018. Siam Ahmed debuted with this film on the silver screen. The film also casts Puja Chery in the lead role.Humayun Ahmed's widely read novel 'Debi' got its film adaptation in the same year. In the film, Jaya Ahsan played the character Ranu and Chanchal Chowdhury played the character of Misir Ali. This cinema was a breath of fresh air in Dhallywood, which attracted a lot of audiences in the theatres. Raihan Rafi directorial ""Poran"" won over audiences, as soon as it was released this year after the dry spell in theatres due to Covid-19. The film casts Bidya Sinha Mim, Sariful Razz, and Yash Rohan in the lead roles. This film is still going strong in theatres. After a long time, the audience came back to watch films in theatres with this film. Mejbaur Rahman Sumon directorial ""Hawa"", which was released on July 29 this year, captured the audiences with its magic. Due to its unique plot and brilliant cinematography, it took over the country by storm. The song ""Shada Shada Kala Kala"" created hype amongst the audience. The film stars Chanchal Chowdhury, Sariful Razz, Nazifa Tushi, Shohel Mondol, Nasir Uddin Khan, and Sumon Anowar in the lead roles. Both ""Hawa"" and ""Poran"" have helped to rejuvenate dead cinema halls across the country, as well as open new ones. Whether it's Jessore's Monihar Hall, which experienced record revenues, or Sylhet's Grand Cineplex, opening to optimistic responses, it seems that the surge is not over yet."

So the target will be to play good cricket and also win the trophy again.""A confident Bangladesh women's team skipper Nigar Sultana Joty had said before they began their Women's Asia Cup title defence earlier this month.However, things did not pan out as the Tigresses had hoped. The defending champions crashed out of the continental championship from the first-round league stage, unable to even book a spot in the semifinals.For the Tigresses, rain was the biggest threat on their way to the semifinals on Tuesday as their game against the UAE was called off at around 10:53am due to incessant showers.A win against the UAE in their last round-robin fixture would have ensured Bangladesh a last-four spot, given their superior net run rate over Thailand but rain enforced a complete washout without a ball bowled at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium.Having shared a point each in the final game against the UAE, Bangladesh finished fifth in the seven-team competition with five points from two wins in six matches while Thailand, who have six points from six matches, went into the semifinals alongside six-time champions India as well as Pakistan and Sri Lanka.The hosts had beaten Thailand and Malaysia but lost their matches against India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka -- the stronger sides in this competition. And all these matches highlighted the discernible shortcomings that have long persisted in the Tigresses' batting department.The most horrible of their batting collapses was against Sri Lanka on Monday when, chasing just a modest 41-run target in seven overs during a curtailed-over contest, Bangladesh lost four wickets in one over and eventually found themselves three runs short of the target.In fact, that defeat had seen the Tigresses leave it to the outcome of their final game against the UAE to decide their way forward in this competition.""Actually, we squandered our opportunity the day before [on Monday against Sri Lanka]. We can't pin the blame on the weather. If we had won against Sri Lanka, we would not have to worry about today's [Tuesday's] outcome. This is really upsetting,"" the BCB women's cricket wing chairman Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel told The Daily Star.It was learned that the dejected Tigresses directly left for the hotel from the dressing room soon after the match was officially called off. What remains to be seen is how Bangladesh, who beat India in the final of the last edition four years ago, pick themselves up and address their issues, especially in the batting department."
/life-living/travel/news/6-most-beautiful-mosques-the-world-3140936,6 most beautiful mosques in the world,"Mosques have been used as places of worship for Muslims all over the world for over a millennium. The beauty and rich history, architecture and cultures of these sacred sites continue to inspire visitors to this day. Sacred sites, regardless of creed or denomination, provide religious insights as well as a greater grasp of history. Mosques, like many other religious monuments around the world, frequently serve as symbols of a city's cultural identity and geography.  The largest mosque in the world, the Al-Haram Mosque, housing the holy Kaaba and the sacred black stone, covers an area of 400,800 square metres and is not only the largest Islamic architecture but also one of the most magnificent mosques in the world. It is one of the most important places of worship in the world, with millions of pilgrims visiting each year for Hajj and Umrah rites. Since its construction, Al-Haram, has grown to accommodate an increasing number of pilgrims. With a total capacity of 4 million worshippers, it is the world's largest mosque.The Great Mosque of Djenné in Mali is recognised as one of the finest examples of Sudano-Sahelian architecture. The original construction, made of mud and adobe plaster, dates back to the 13th century, however, the mosque was rebuilt in 1907. The ostrich eggs positioned at the very top of the pillars are one of the Great Mosque's most distinguishing features; they are a sign of fertility and purity in the Malian region.Unlike most traditional mosques across the world, Malaysia's Crystal Mosque has a more modern and sleek appearance because of its all-steel and glass structure. When the prayer halls and conference rooms are illuminated from within, the mosque's glass domes appear to be composed of pure gold. The Crystal Mosque's architecture and design incorporate a few Chinese-inspired elements.Sultan Ahmed Mosque, often known as the Blue Mosque because of the Blue Iznik tiles that cover its interiors, is a breath-taking sight. The mosque comes from the 17th century when it was built during the reign of Ahmed I. This construction is thought to be the last big mosque of the classical era, with six high-rising minarets and five main domes. The Great Mosque of Xi'an, a combination of traditional Chinese design and Islamic practicality, comprises more than 20 buildings across five courtyards, making it China's largest mosque. Many of the architectural aspects of the sacred site pay homage to Persian heritage while remaining true to the style of infrastructure during the Ming and Qing dynasties. For example, the ""Examining the Heart Tower"" pagoda in the third courtyard serves as the mosque's minaret.This mosque is a stunning blend of contemporary and traditional Islamic art. The mosque features a distinctively designed dome, shaped in five independent segments that optically make a single thing, with curved geometric shapes and patterns. Duan Damonja, a well-known Croatian sculptor, designed the Islamic Centre Mosque. The mosque, which is now a major tourist destination, was built in response to the Islamic population in Rijeka's long-held desire for a dedicated location for prayer."
/sports/football/news/chelsea-top-group-comfortable-win-10-man-milan-3140636,Chelsea top group with comfortable win at 10-man Milan,"Chelsea completed the double over AC Milan to top Champions League Group E with a 2-0 victory at San Siro on Tuesday, a match the hosts had to play the majority of with 10 men.Looking to build on a 3-0 win over the Italians last week, Chelsea's task in Milan's famous old stadium was made all the more navigable after home defender Fikayo Tomori was sent off against his former club when conceding a 17th-minute penalty.Jorginho converted from the spot after Milan's protests had calmed down, before striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored for the third successive match in all competitionsto double Chelsea's lead in the 34th minute.With the numerical disadvantage, chances were at a premium for Milan in the second half, full-back Sergino Dest wasting the best of them by blazing over from a good position.Chelsea remained mostly untroubled though, with the victory moving them to seven points from four matches, a point ahead of RB Salzburg and three in front of Milan and Dinamo Zagreb.Qualification for the knockout stages looked like it may be a tall order for Chelsea after a shock defeat in their group opener at Dinamo Zagreb was followed by a disappointing home draw with Salzburg.But victory over seven-time European Cup winners and Serie A champions Milan last week brought Chelsea right back into it -- setting things up nicely for the return match in Italy.England international Tomori's foul on Mason Mount, however, effectively ended the match as a contest.Tomori, who joined Milan from Chelsea in 2021, could not believe the referee showed him a straight red card, but the decision stood after a VAR review, as the 24-year-old became the first English player to get sent off in a Champions League game against an English side.Jorginho confidently dispatched the spot kick, and the second goal was brimming with quality, with Mount heavily involved, laying the ball through for Aubameyang to continue his fine scoring run having joined Chelsea from Barcelona last month.Substitute Conor Gallagher should have added a third early in the second, before blazing another opportunity over later in the half, but it mattered little, as Chelsea, in cruise control, saw the match out with ease.It is now four wins from five in all competitions for new coach Graham Potter since taking over from Thomas Tuchel last month."

The G7 vowed to support Kyiv for ""as long as it takes.""A US-led coalition of some 50 countries known as the Ukraine Defence Contact Group will meet in Brussels on Wednesday on the sidelines of a NATO defence ministers meeting.""I am anticipating from our partners progress on matters of anti-aircraft and anti-missile defences and agreements on new supplies of different weapons and ammunition vital for us,"" Zelenskiy said in an evening address on Tuesday.The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday night that Russian missile strikes had damaged more than 10 cities, including Lviv, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Zaporizhzhia. Air raid sirens wailed earlier across the country for a second day.""Over the past 24 hours, the occupiers have again resorted to mass missile strikes - more than 30 cruise missiles, seven air strikes and 25 instances of shelling,"" Ukraine's armed forces said.The Ukrainian command said its forces killed more than 100 Russian troops in the southern Kherson region. Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield reports.The activity on Tuesday was less intense than the day before when dozens of strikes killed 19 people, wounded more than 100 and knocked out power across the country in Moscow's biggest aerial offensive since the start of its invasion on Feb. 24.More missile strikes on Tuesday killed seven people in the southeastern town of Zaporizhzhia, a presidential aide said, and left part of the western city of Lviv without power.Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov celebrated the arrival from the United States of what he said were four additional High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), whose accuracy and longer range have allowed Ukraine to reduce Russia's artillery advantage.""HIMARS time,"" he wrote on Twitter, was a ""good time for Ukrainians and bad time for the occupiers.""Ukraine on Tuesday received the first of four IRIS-T air defence systems Germany promised to supply, a German defence ministry source said. The United States said it was speeding up the shipment of NASAMS air defences to Ukraine. Washington has already provided more than $16.8 billion worth of security aid to Ukraine during the war.The G7 - which groups the United States, Germany, France, Japan, Britain, Italy and Canada - pledged continued ""financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support ... for as long as it takes"" to Ukraine, it said in a statement.It also condemned ""indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations"" as war crimes and said Putin would be held to account for them.Moscow, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to eliminate dangerous nationalists and protect Russian speakers, has accused the West of escalating and prolonging the conflict by supporting Kyiv.Kyiv and its Western backers accuse Russia of an unprovoked land grab in Ukraine. And Zelenskiy on Tuesday again ruled out peace talks with Putin.In an interview on state television, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was open to talks with the United States or with Turkey on ways to end the war, now in its eight month, but had yet to receive any serious proposal to negotiate.Washington dismissed such offers as ""posturing""."

Hundreds of settlements around Kyiv, Lviv and elsewhere were still without power yesterday.As Russia rained down cruise missiles on cities across Ukraine in a new escalation of the war, President Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday asked the leaders of the G7 group of nations to urgently supply Ukraine with air defence weapons.The White House said US President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders met virtually to discuss what more they can do to support Ukraine and listened to Zelensky, who has called air defence systems his ""number 1 priority"".The Ukrainian leader urged leaders to back a tough cap on Russian oil and gas exports, and again ruled out talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also urged G7 countries to help create ""air shield"" for Ukraine and asked the G7 to support an international mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border.Biden has already promised more air defences, a pledge that Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said would extend the conflict. ""The mood of this summit is already obvious and predictable. The confrontation will continue,"" Peskov told reporters.US-led Nato said yesterday its member states were boosting security around key installations. Nato was closely monitoring Russia's nuclear forces, but had not seen any change in its nuclear posture, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.Putin yesterday met the president of the United Arab Emirates, a member of the group of oil producers known as OPEC+ that rebuffed the United States last week by announcing steep production cuts."

All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja also failed to make the squad, with a knee injury.Standby seamers Mohammed Shami and Deepak Chahar are expected to replace Bumrah and join a pace brigade that includes Arshdeep Singh, Harshal Patel and all-rounder Hardik Pandya.Head coach Rahul Dravid backed his bowlers to do well in Australia.""We certainly have confidence in the boys.

Yuzvendra Chahal, Axar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin and Deepak Hooda will be India's options for spin, which is set to play a key role on the Australian pitches.""Guys need a lot more clarity in terms of what they want to achieve and it's my job to make sure it happens,"" said skipper Rohit.""Lot of the guys haven't been to Australia, which is why we wanted to go early. Play on some bouncy pitches in Perth and see what we can do there.""India's batting looks in fine shape after Virat Kohli's return to form at last month's Asia Cup, when he smashed his maiden T20 century.Kohli seems to have found his mojo after an extended slump, also walloping an unbeaten 49 off 28 balls in the second South Africa T20.Suryakumar Yadav has also been in blazing form and the big-hitter amassed 119 runs at a strike-rate of 195.08 to hammer the South African bowlers in the series.Rohit, vice-captain KL Rahul, Pandya and Dinesh Karthik -- in the team as a specialist finisher -- have also been in ominous form.

/news/asia/india/news/2-women-killed-human-sacrifice-indias-kerala-3141006,2 women killed as “human sacrifice” in India’s Kerala,"Indian police said Wednesday they have arrested three people including a man claiming to be an occult practitioner for allegedly killing two women as human sacrifices in the belief they would become rich.A couple in financial difficulties paid Mohammed Shafi 300,000 rupees ($3,640) to ""arrange"" two victims who he then ""brutally abused and killed"" in separate rituals three months apart, police spokesman Pramod Kumar told AFP.Shafi told the couple, Bhagaval Singh and wife Laila from the southern state of Kerala, that the ""human sacrifice was the way to great riches"", police said.Shafi, described by police as a ""sexual pervert"" who was previously accused of rape, ""enticed"" the first victim to Singh's home in June on the pretext of a role in a local movie.Investigators say Shafi then convinced the couple to take part in a second sacrifice in September after they complained their fortunes had not changed.""We were already investigating the case of the first missing woman when we found that the last mobile phone location of (another) woman who went missing in September was also around the couple's home,"" Kumar said.Both women made a living selling lottery tickets door-to-door. Their mutilated bodies were buried in the couple's compound. Police are now investigating if Shafi was also involved in other cases.Neighbours of Singh, who described himself as a traditional healer, told the Hindustan Times newspaper that ""it was difficult for them to believe he was a party to gory murders"".""Many people used to come here for treatment for fractures, bruises and other such ailments. We never suspected anything foul and he was well mannered as well,"" Gopan K. told the daily.Experts say belief in witchcraft and the occult remains widespread in many tribal and remote areas of India, where occasional incidents of human sacrifice have been reported.Earlier this month two men were arrested for allegedly killing a six-year-old child in the capital New Delhi, reports said.The construction workers told police they were under the influence of cannabis and murdered the boy as a sacrifice to the Hindu god Shiva to get rich."
/entertainment/tv-film/news/back-the-future-stars-reunion-leaves-fans-emotional-3140716,Back To The Future stars’ reunion leaves fans emotional ,"Fans of the Back To The Future films (1985 to 1990) have been beside themselves after the classic sci-fi franchise's stars, Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox, reunited for a panel at New York Comic Con last Saturday. In the films, Lloyd, 83, played a zany scientist who converts a sports car into a time-travelling machine, while Fox, 61, played a hapless teenager who ends up travelling backwards and forwards in time.On his Instagram account, Lloyd expressed his gratitude to fans who have continued to support the franchise almost four decades on. ""I cherish these moments,"" he wrote in a caption alongside photos of him and Fox speaking at the panel, which he posted on Monday.   A post shared by Christopher Lloyd (@mrchristopherlloyd)
A video of the duo hugging during the session also made the rounds on social media over the weekend, with fans saying they were brought to tears and others calling it a ""beautiful"" moment.  Both Lloyd and Fox have continued to make small appearances in film and television in recent years, though Fox's acting career has been disrupted due to the worsening symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which he was first diagnosed with in 1991.In a recap of the panel, entertainment outlet Syfy said that Fox addressed his diagnosis during the fireside chat with Lloyd: ""Parkinson's is a gift. I've said to people it's a gift and they say, 'You're nuts.' I say, 'Yeah, but it's the gift that keeps on taking.' But it's a gift and I wouldn't change it for anything. It's not about what I have, it's about what I've been given.""He also said that it was ""a thrill"" to work with Lloyd on the Back To The Future films. ""Anytime I got to work with him, I knew it was gonna be a good day.""Even though Fox was cast six weeks after principal photography had begun on the first film - replacing another actor, Eric Stoltz – Lloyd said their strong chemistry turned out to be the glue that held the franchise together.""The chemistry was there from the first scene we had, it was alive, and it remained that way for three movies,"" he said. "

""If they apply [for permission to adjust the prices], the BERC will act accordingly.""People across the country are enduring hours of power outages every day as 58 of the 148 working power plants have been dialled down generation because of fuel crises over the past week.Prof M Shamsul Alam, senior vice president of Consumers Association of Bangladesh, said, ""It will be illegal if the BERC increases the electricity price even by Tk 0.01… They wouldn't be able to justify the price hike at a time when the people are enduring frequent load-shedding. When Bangladesh Power Development Board sought the price hike in May, there was no outage.""Based on the PDB request, a public hearing was held on May 18 at the BIAM Auditorium in which a technical evaluation committee formed by the BERC recommended increasing the bulk price by 58 percent.The government later informed the BERC about a Tk 17,000 crore subsidy for PDB.According to law, the price of electricity should be announced within 90 working days of the public hearing. The period ends tomorrow.The technical committee observed that it would not be possible to implement an increased bulk price unless the price was adjusted at the consumer level.Bulk electricity price was increased the last time in February 2020."

But they have given no indication on whether they would consider this.Tiley said he spent time with Djokovic recently and the Serbian wanted to return for the first major of the year in January in Melbourne.""What we're saying at this point is that Novak and the federal government need to work out the situation. And then we'll follow any instruction after that,"" Tiley told The Age newspaper at the tournament's official launch.""I did spend some time with Novak at the Laver Cup. We spoke generally.

She is being held in solitary confinement in the capital, Naypyitaw, and her trials have been conducted in closed courts.The latest charges were related to allegations Suu Kyi accepted bribes from a businessman, said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.Suu Kyi received three-year jail sentences on two charges, to be served concurrently.Opponents of the military say the charges against Suu Kyi are aimed at blocking her from ever getting involved in politics again or trying to challenge the military's grip on power since last year's coup.A junta spokesperson did not answer calls seeking comment on Wednesday.

So, their bail petitions were rejected considering the depth of offences.All the 24 activists were sent to jail on Saturday after they were produced before another Dhaka court in connection with the cases.The court, however, fixed yesterday for hearing on the bail petitions.During yesterday's hearing, advocate Masud Ahmed Talukder told the court the accused were mercilessly beaten by the complainants and their associates.The victims were sued, arrested, and sent to jail whereas the arrestees were supposed to file cases against the attackers for their involvement in the attacks.So, their bail petitions should be granted, the lawyer added.The prosecution, however, opposed the defence plea on grounds that the charges brought against them of hurting the complainants grievously were primarily proved.Upon hearing both the sides, the magistrate turned down the defence pleas.Chhatra League Organising Secretary Nazim Uddin and activist Aminur Rahman filed the cases with Shahbagh Police Station accusing 25 and 140-150 unnamed people.Police on October 7 detained 24 parishad men at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and from nearby areas in connection with the incident.Among the detainees were several people who went to the hospital for treatment of their injuries.Earlier in that day, at least 13 people were injured when BCL attacked a rally organised by the parishad marking the death anniversary of Buet student Abrar Fahad.Abrar died on October 7, 2019, in a dormitory after being brutally beaten up by some Chhatra League men."
/news/bangladesh/news/100-buses-2-more-routes-tomorrow-3140526,Nagar Paribahan: 100 buses on 2 more routes from tomorrow,"When the first batch of buses, launched in December last year to introduce a new system in the capital's bus service, are struggling to provide expected services, two more routes are going to be brought under the system from tomorrow. The new routes -- one from Ghatarchar to Demra Staff Quarters (route-22) while another from Ghatarchar to Kadamtali (route-26) in the capital -- will be launched with 50 buses on each route under the name of Nagar Paribahan.Obhi Enterprise, a private operator, will provide 50 brand new buses for the Ghatarchar to Demra Staff Quarters route while state-run Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation will provide 50 buses, procured in 2019, for the other route, said officials.Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader will inaugurate the services from Bosila tomorrow. Two mayors of the Dhaka city are expected to join the programme.The new routes -- one from Ghatarchar to Demra Staff Quarters (route-22) while another from Ghatarchar to Kadamtali (route-26) in the capital -- will be launched with 50 buses on each route under the name of Nagar Paribahan. The new routes -- one from Ghatarchar to Demra Staff Quarters (route-22) while another from Ghatarchar to Kadamtali (route-26) in the capital -- will be launched with 50 buses on each route under the name of Nagar Paribahan. The service was supposed to be introduced on September 1.The move came around 10 months after the authorities launched bus services on Ghatarchar to Kanchpur route under ""single company, single-route"" formula, with an aim to bring discipline to the city's transport system.Currently, around 5,000 to 6,000 buses are being operated under over a hundred companies on around 400 routes, many of which overlap each other, in the capital and adjacent areas, along with several hundred BRTC buses. Most of the private buses operate on a ""trip basis"" -- a system where bus owners receive a certain amount of money for each trip from the drivers, who often engaged in unhealthy competition to pick up more passengers. This mentality among bus drivers is a major reason behind road crashes and traffic congestion in the city.In the given situation, transport experts recommended for rationalising the bus routes and bringing all public buses under a fixed number of companies for better regulation.Late DNCC Mayor Annisul Huq had taken initiative in this regard, which did not see light due to his demise. Later, the government in September 2018, formed a committee led by DSCC mayor in the chair to introduce the system and rationalise the route.To introduce the system, the authorities preliminarily decided to introduce nine cluster under different colour and bring all the buses under 22 companies and all routes under 42 routes.As per the decision, 54 existing routes would be brought under eight routes (from Route 21 to 28) under ""Green Cluster"". On December 26 last year, the new system was launched with 50 buses -- 20 from Trans Silva, a private bus operator and 30 double-decker buses from BRTC on a pilot basis.But the services can't provide expected service to passengers, who often alleged that the buses pick up and drop off passengers randomly instead of dedicated stations.On the other hand, operators alleged that the only dedicated buses should be operated on the route. But many buses without route permit operate on the routes due to poor monitoring by the authorities.A BRTC official said the service isn't  profitable for them as they have to provide all expenses for ticketing and station services and 35 percent of the daily income to the private bus operators.An official of Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA), which is providing secretariat service to the bus rationalisation committee, said non-cooperation from the bus owners is the main reasons behind the struggle of their piloting service.""We are trying to make the initiative successful, taking all stakeholders on board,"" he said.He said among the 54 routes, 34 are inside the city and they are expecting to launch buses in all 34 routes within 2024.He also said they will form a company after introducing buses in all routes of the green cluster within next year.The Daily Star couldn't contact Shabiha Parvin, executive director of DTCA, over phone for comments."
/environment/climate-crisis/climate-loss/news/amazon-hydropower-brazils-people-the-river-pay-the-price-3141046,Amazon hydropower: Brazil's 'people of the river' pay the price,"The waters of the Xingu River below the Belo Monte hydropower dam, in Brazil's Amazon, used to flood the river's forested islands during the rainy season, allowing fish to glide among the trees and gorge on fallen fruit.But since the controversial dam opened six years ago, the forests no longer flood consistently, and the fish have lost a key place to feed and spawn, local people say.""Today, these fruits all fall onto dry land, so the fish can't get the food,"" said Josiel Pereira, an indigenous Juruna man from the village of Miratu, in Para state.During the dry season, in turn, the dam sometimes releases too much water at once, drowning sandy beaches and destroying the nests where turtles have long laid their eggs, said Pereira, who is helping scientists understand the ecological impacts of the dam's construction.""It has been very difficult for us to survive after the Belo Monte dam development,"" he said in an interview. ""It has caused a lot of impact on our food, on our source of income.""Estimated to cost at least 40 billion Brazilian real ($7.6 billion), the Belo Monte hydroelectric complex, the world's fourth biggest hydropower dam, includes a main dam called Pimental and the Belo Monte reservoir.Harnessing the waters of the Xingu, the dam generated about 5% of all of Brazil's electricity last year, according to its operator Norte Energia.But the huge dam complex, vigorously opposed by many indigenous groups in the Amazon, is also changing age-old patterns of seasonally rising and falling water downstream, disrupting the balance of nature and the lives of people who depend on it, scientists and residents warn.""I feel sad because before I could earn my living, my family's living, by fishing,"" said Pedro Viana, 51, as he sat on the prow of a boat, trailing a fishing net in the abrupt turn in the Xingu known as the Volta Grande, or ""Big Bend"", a 130-km (80-mile) stretch of river downstream from the Belo Monte.""Nowadays, I have to survive by selling farina (manioc flour) and bananas,"" said Viana, a member of the local Juruna indigenous community.Researchers and indigenous advocacy groups say the Belo Monte complex's main Pimental dam blocks about 80% of the Xingu's water, sending it through an artificial channel that feeds the power station.Currently, the dam sends a maximum of 4,000 or 8,000 cubic meters of water downstream per second in the wet season - the amount alternates each year - and 700 cubic meters in the dry season, according to Norte Energia.But locals and researchers say that is a fraction of historical water release levels. That has prompted Brazil's environmental agency Ibama to ask for new studies into the impacts of the dam's water release levels.A May 2022 report by researchers from the United States and Brazil, partly funded by Norte Energia, found a nearly 30% reduction in fish species' ""richness, abundance, and functional diversity"" and an overall drop in fish sizes in the Volta Grande as a result of the Belo Monte complex's construction.Norte Energia has come up with proposals to adjust the amount of water it releases each season, to be considered by the federal prosecutor's office, which in the past has filed several lawsuits against the company for environmental damage caused by the construction of the dam.In a statement, Norte Energia said the amounts of water allocated below the Pimental dam were intended to ""ensure the ecological conditions of the Big Bend"" and create flows that ""simulate the natural pulse of the Xingu River.""In particular, the periods of lowest water release were not below naturally occurring levels in some years, it said.But Andre Oliveira Sawakuchi, an associate professor at the University of Sao Paulo's Institute of Geosciences and an expert who has studied the area for more than a decade, disagrees.The Volta Grande's colossal water discharge and granite rock base had created, over time, an ecosystem of forested islands in the river which have adapted to the seasonal ebb and flow of the river, Oliveira Sawakuchi said.""Here, we have a forest inside the river. This is very particular and unique,"" he said.But the dam's engineering has caused a ""total disruption of this ecosystem. It's not possible to keep both things working completely - energy production and the ecosystem,"" he added. The Juruna people have joined with scientists and the Brazilian nonprofit Socioenvironmental Institute, or ISA, to propose an alternate plan for water releases from the Pimental dam that would provide more water for themselves and nature.Their counter-proposal is expected to be considered by the federal prosecutor next month, alongside the company's.Around the Volta Grande there are already high-water marks exposed on boulders, wide sand dunes along the shores and new islands in the stream - all land that had been previously underwater.The Juruna - who call themselves the ""people of the river"" - say the changes are worrying for communities that have since time immemorial depended on the river for navigation, fish, and water for drinking, cooking and bathing.For the Juruna, a confluence of low waterfalls and rapids called Jericoa in the Volta Grande is a sacred place. Whitewater cascades create swirling eddies in the river, which they navigate with ease in wooden canoes or skiffs.Wearing a traditional headdress of blue and red macaw feathers ringed with white plumes, Giliarde Juruna, 40, chief of Mïratu village, rued the threats facing his people.He said former Juruna leaders had been tricked by Norte Energia into accepting environmental and financial pledges that the company failed to live up to.""They promised us we would have energy for free,"" he said. But at about 500 real a month per household, the electricity generated by the dam costs more than most in the community can afford, he complained.In a statement, the company said it had carried out ""more than 100 socio-environmental projects"" in the Volta Grande since 2011, complying with an agreement with Ibama.These include installing fish farms and cocoa plantations and bringing potable water access, sanitation and sewage systems to riverside communities, as well as providing healthcare access to families in the ""dam's area of influence"".Local people say those changes do little to benefit them.In Miratu, Josiel Pereira pointed to dead fish floating in one of the fish farms. He said the fish were an introduced species that were not well adapted to the area, unlike the once-abundant native species like pacu. Without enough fish in the Xingu, Silvia Da Cruiz, an indigenous mother of four in Miratu, said she has to buy meat, chicken and processed foods to feed her family, raising the cost of living and forcing families like hers into the cash economy.""It's not true that Belo Monte dam's energy is clean,"" said Mariel Nakane, an economist working with ISA.

This year, too, the government ran a countrywide campaign against illegal healthcare facilities, shutting down more than 1,600 such institutions. No one can say how many unregistered hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centres and blood banks exist in the country. According to some estimates, the number of illegal hospitals is two or three times that of the legal ones.Healthcare providers cannot operate in secret, so how is it that so many unauthorised institutions have been able to run their activities? The more important question is: why are more and more people going to private institutions for healthcare?Over the years, budget allocations for the health sector as a proportion of the GDP have steadily declined in Bangladesh, which is now below one percent. Bangladesh is ranked the lowest in South Asia in terms of per capita government expenditure on healthcare. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), 49 percent of the country's population do not receive quality healthcare services. In 2020, the health sector was running with less than 10 doctors, nurses, and midwives for every 10,000 people. And the skills of the majority of doctors, nurses, and midwives in the country do not meet the standards set by WHO.Most of the hospitals that have been declared illegal by the government were occupied by doctors who are registered with Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC). Assistants at operation theatres (OTs) perform minor to major surgeries. There are not enough nurses; in many places, cleaners work as nurses. Smoke from the kitchen enters OTs at times, and used equipment is used to treat patients. Hospitals have been found to accommodate patients far beyond their capacity. Quality of lab work is substandard, and not all facilities are available to run tests. In many places, the environment is not good for patients at all.The raids that have shut down numerous unregistered hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres frequently seem to be for show now – one day they are closed, and the next day they are up and running again. The health administration has consistently failed to stop the massive level of corruption and irregularities that go on in these healthcare facilities, as an overwhelming majority of owners of illegal hospitals are politically influential.Illegal and unlicensed hospitals are mainly broker-dependent. In other words, agents of these hospitals roam around in the government hospitals, which are overburdened and have limited resources, and lure patients and their families – especially those who come from rural areas to seek medical treatment – to these private practices. In these hospitals, patients are often subjected to maltreatment, and the expenses are also very high. Many patients and their families lose everything to pay for their medical bills. These brokers roam around openly and are known. Yet, no action is taken against them.Owners of illegal clinics and diagnostic centres are also quite well-connected – both financially and politically. Therefore, oftentimes, if a patient dies due to improper treatment in any of these clinics, not much is said and done about it. That is why the raids to identify and fine illegal practices do not bring any significant change in the country's healthcare system. Unless the core problems are addressed, they never will.Healthcare has turned into a lucrative business for many people in the country, who do not deviate from their mission to make profits even in the most extreme situations. We have all seen how some people made hundreds of thousands of taka just by selling masks and testing kits in the early days of Covid-19 pandemic, when there was a severe crisis. Measly budgetary allocations for the health sector have not helped the situation either. Lack of priority on the government's part to make healthcare accessible to everyone is leaving a major segment of our population vulnerable to these profiteers. The only way to save our health sector from them and make quality healthcare accessible and affordable for the general mass is to bring the entire healthcare system of the country under the public sector. Regulations have to be in place and implemented in order bring semblance of accountability to the healthcare sector. Conducting some raids against private hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres from time to time will not make much difference.Dr Rakib Al Hasan is a physician, author, activist, and youth leader.

/tech-startup/outer-space/news/nasas-dart-spacecraft-altered-path-asteroid-3140681,Nasa's Dart spacecraft altered path of asteroid,"The spacecraft NASA deliberately crashed into an asteroid last month succeeded in nudging the rocky moonlet from its natural path into a faster orbit, marking the first time humanity has altered the motion of a celestial body, the U.S. space agency announced on Tuesday.The $330 million proof-of-concept mission, which was seven years in development, also represented the world's first test of a planetary defense system designed to prevent a potential doomsday meteorite collision with Earth.Findings of telescope observations unveiled at a NASA news briefing in Washington confirmed the suicide test flight of the DART spacecraft on Sept. 26 achieved its primary objective: changing the direction of an asteroid through sheer kinetic force.Astronomical measurements over the past two weeks showed the target asteroid was bumped slightly closer to the larger parent asteroid it orbits and that its orbital period was shortened by 32 minutes, NASA scientists said.""This is a watershed moment for planetary defense and a watershed moment for humanity,"" NASA chief Bill Nelson told reporters in announcing the results. ""It felt like a movie plot, but this was not Hollywood.""Last month's impact, 6.8 million miles (10.9 million km) from Earth, was monitored in real time from the mission operations center at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, where the spacecraft was designed and built for NASA.DART's celestial target was an egg-shaped asteroid named Dimorphos, roughly the size of a football stadium, that was orbiting a parent asteroid about five times bigger called Didymos once every 11 hours, 55 minutes.The test flight concluded with the DART impactor vehicle, no bigger than a refrigerator, slamming directly into Dimorphos at about 14,000 miles per hour (22,531 kph).Comparison of pre- and post-impact measurements of the Dimorphos-Didymos pair as one eclipses the other shows the orbital period was shortened to 11 hours, 23 minutes, with the smaller object bumped tens of meters closer to its parent.POSSIBLE WOBBLETom Statler, DART program scientist for NASA, said the collision also left Dimorphos ""wobbling a bit,"" but additional observations would be necessary to confirm that.The outcome ""demonstrated we are capable of deflecting a potentially hazardous asteroid of this size,"" if it were discovered well enough in advance, said Lori Glaze, director of NASA's planetary science division. ""The key is early detection.""Neither of the two asteroids involved, nor DART itself, short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test, posed any actual threat to Earth, NASA scientists said.But Nancy Chabot, DART's coordination lead at APL, said Dimorphos ""is a size of asteroid that is a priority for planetary defense.""A Dimorphos-sized asteroid, while not capable of posing a planet-wide threat, could level a major city with a direct hit.Scientists had predicted the DART impact would shorten Dimorphos' orbital path by at least 10 minutes but would have considered a change as small as 73 seconds a success. So the actual change of more than a half hour, with a margin of uncertainty plus or minus two minutes, exceeded expectations.The relatively loose composition of rubble that Dimorphos appears to consist of may be a factor in how much the asteroid was budged by DART's blow.The impact blasted tons of rocky material from the asteroid's surface into space, visible in telescope images as a large debris plume, producing a recoil effect that added to the force exerted on Dimorphos from the collision itself, NASA said.Launched by a SpaceX rocket in November 2021, DART made most of its voyage under the guidance of flight directors on the ground, with control handed over to the craft's autonomous on-board navigation system in the final hours of the journey.Dimorphos and Didymos are both tiny compared with the cataclysmic Chicxulub asteroid that struck Earth some 66 million years ago, wiping out about three-quarters of the world's plant and animal species including the dinosaurs.Smaller asteroids are far more common and present a greater theoretical concern in the near term, making the Didymos pair suitable test subjects for their size, according to NASA scientists and planetary defense experts.Also, the two asteroids' relative proximity to Earth and dual configuration made them ideal for the DART mission.The Dimorphos moonlet is one of the smallest astronomical objects to receive a permanent name and is one of 27,500 known near-Earth asteroids of all sizes tracked by NASA. Although none are known to pose a foreseeable hazard to humankind, NASA estimates that many more asteroids remain undetected in the near-Earth vicinity."

But they did not provide any information on the number of leaders held.BNP leaders said police conducted raids in different residential hotels in the port city and outskirts where BNP leaders and activists from different districts booked rooms to participate in Wednesday's rally.Sources in the BNP said soon after party leaders were apprehended in the raid, they sent out instructions to leaders and activists against staying home.Contacted, Idris Ali, assistant office secretary of Chattogram city unit BNP, said police conducted raids in the houses of president, secretary, and other leaders of BNP in almost every ward in the city on Tuesday night.Police conducted raids at the houses of Didarul Ferrdous, vice president of city unit Juba Dal, and two other BNP leaders, Habibur Rahman and Aziz Chowdhury at Pahartoli area.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/angela-lansbury-murder-she-wrote-and-beauty-and-the-beast-star-dies-96-3140676,"Angela Lansbury, 'Murder, She Wrote' and 'Beauty and the Beast' star, dies at 96","Angela Lansbury, the scene-stealing British actor who kicked up her heels in the Broadway musicals ""Mame"" and ""Gypsy"" and solved endless murders as crime novelist Jessica Fletcher in the long-running TV series ""Murder, She Wrote,"" has died. She was 96.Lansbury died Tuesday at her home in Los Angeles, according to a statement from her three children. She died five days shy of her 97th birthday.Hers was a 75-year career that included beloved musicals on stage, iron-fisted matriarchs on film, singing the theme song for the animated movie ""Beauty and the Beast,"" being made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II and the creation of one of television's best loved characters.Lansbury won five Tony Awards for her Broadway performances and a lifetime achievement award. She earned Academy Award nominations as supporting actress for two of her first three films, ""Gaslight"" (1945) and ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" (1946), and was nominated again in 1962 for ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and her deadly portrayal of a Communist agent and the title character's mother.Her mature demeanor prompted producers to cast her much older than her actual age. In 1948, when she was 23, her hair was streaked with gray so she could play a fortyish newspaper publisher with a yen for Spencer Tracy in ""State of the Union.""Her stardom came in middle age when she became the hit of the New York theater, winning Tony Awards for ""Mame"" (1966), ""Dear World"" (1969), ""Gypsy"" (1975) and ""Sweeney Todd"" (1979).She was back on Broadway and got another Tony nomination in 2007 in Terrence McNally's ""Deuce,"" playing a scrappy, brash former tennis star, reflecting with another ex-star as she watches a modern-day match from the stands. In 2009 she collected her fifth Tony, for best featured actress in a revival of Noel Coward's ""Blithe Spirit"" and in 2015 won an Olivier Award in the role.Broadway royalty paid their respects. Audra McDonald tweeted: ""She was an icon, a legend, a gem, and about the nicest lady you'd ever want to meet."" Leslie Uggams on Twitter wrote: ""Dame Angela was so sweet to me when I made my Broadway debut. She was a key person in welcoming me to the community. She truly lived, lived, lived!""Playwright Paul Rudnick added: ""she provided the most fabulous, irreplaceable joy. She was beloved as a person and an actress, and managed to be approachable, glamorous and heartbreaking. She'll be missed, celebrated and adored.""But Lansbury's widest fame began in 1984 when she launched ""Murder, She Wrote"" on CBS. Based loosely on Agatha Christie's Miss Marple stories, the series centered on Jessica Fletcher, a middle-aged widow and former substitute school teacher living in the seaside village of Cabot Cove, Maine. She had achieved notice as a mystery novelist and amateur sleuth.The actor found the first series season exhausting.""I was shocked when I learned that I had to work 12-15 hours a day, relentlessly, day in, day out,"" she recalled. ""I had to lay down the law at one point and say 'Look, I can't do these shows in seven days; it will have to be eight days.'""CBS and the production company, Universal Studio, agreed, especially since ""Murder, She Wrote"" had become a Sunday night hit. Despite the long days — she left her home at Brentwood in West Los Angeles at 6 a.m. and returned after dark — and reams of dialogue to memorize, Lansbury maintained a steady pace. She was pleased that Jessica Fletcher served as an inspiration for older women.""Women in motion pictures have always had a difficult time being role models for other women,"" she observed. ""They've always been considered glamorous in their jobs.""In the series' first season, Jessica wore clothes that were almost frumpy. Then she acquired smartness, Lansbury reasoning that, as a successful woman, Jessica should dress the part.""Murder, She Wrote"" stayed high in the ratings through its 11th year. Then CBS, seeking a younger audience for Sunday night, shifted the series to a less favorable midweek slot. Lansbury protested vigorously to no avail. As expected, the ratings plummeted and the show was canceled. For consolation, CBS contracted for two-hour movies of ""Murder, She Wrote"" and other specials starring Lansbury.""Murder, She Wrote"" and other television work brought her 18 Emmy nominations but she never won one. She holds the record for the most Golden Globe nominations and wins for best actress in a television drama series and the most Emmy nominations for lead actress in a drama series.In a 2008 Associated Press interview, Lansbury said she still welcomed the right script but did not want to play ""old, decrepit women,"" she said. ""I want women my age to be represented the way they are, which is vital, productive members of society.""""I'm astonished at the amount of stuff I managed to pack into the years that I have been in the business. And I'm still here!""She was given the name Angela Brigid Lansbury when she was born in London on Oct. 16, 1925. Her family was distinguished: a grandfather was the fiery head of the Labour Party; her father the owner of a veneer factory; her mother a successful actor, Moyna MacGill.""I was terribly shy, absolutely incapable of coming out of my shell,"" Lansbury remembered of her youth. ""It took me years to get over that.""The Depression forced her father's factory into bankruptcy, and for a few years the family lived on money her mother had saved from her theater career. Angela suffered a shattering blow when her beloved father died in 1935. The tragedy forced her to become self-reliant — ""almost a surrogate husband to my mother.""When England was threatened with German bombings in 1940, Moyna Lansbury struggled through red tape and won passage to America for her family. With the help of two sponsoring families, they settled in New York and lived on $150 a month. To add to their income, Angela at 16 landed a nightclub job in Montreal doing impersonations and songs.""The only thing I ever had confidence in is my ability to perform,"" she said. ""That has been the grace note in my sonata of life, the thing that has absolutely seen me through thick and thin.""Moyna moved the family to Hollywood, hoping to find acting work. Failing that, she and Angela wrapped packages and sold clothing at a department store. An actor friend suggested Angela would be ideal for the role of Sybil Vane in ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" which was being prepared at MGM. She tested, and studio boss Louis B. Mayer ordered: ""Sign that girl!""She was just 19 when her first film, ""Gaslight,"" earned her an Oscar nomination, but MGM didn't know what to do with the new contract player. She appeared as Elizabeth Taylor's older sister in ""National Velvet,"" Judy Garland's nemesis in ""The Harvey Girls,"" Walter Pidgeon's spiteful wife in ""If Winter Comes"" and Queen Anne in ""The Three Musketeers.""Tired of playing roles twice her own age, she left MGM to freelance but the results were much the same: the mother of Warren Beatty in ""All Fall Down,"" of Elvis Presley in ""Blue Hawaii,"" of Carroll Baker in ""Harlow,"" and of Laurence Harvey in ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" in which she unforgettably manipulates her son and helps set off a killing spree.In the mid-1940s, Lansbury had a disastrous nine-month marriage to Richard Cromwell, a soulful young star of the 1930s. In 1949, she married Peter Shaw, a Briton who had been under an acting contract to MGM, then became a studio executive and agent. He assumed the role of Lansbury's manager. They had two children; he had a son by a previous marriage.The 1950s were a troubled time for the Shaws. Angela's career slowed down; her mother died after a battle with cancer; Peter underwent a hip operation; the children were on drugs; the family house in Malibu burned to the ground.Lansbury later said of the fire: ""It's like cutting off a branch, a big, luscious branch of your life and sealing it off with a sealer so it doesn't bleed, That's what you do. That's how the human mind deals with those things. You have to pick up the pieces and go on.""Weary of 20 years of typecasting, Lansbury tried her luck on Broadway. Her first two shows — ""Anyone Can Whistle"" and ""Hotel Paradiso"" (with Bert Lahr) — flopped.Then came ""Mame."" Rosalind Russell declined to repeat her classic role as Patrick Dennis's dizzy aunt in a musical version. So did Mary Martin and Ethel Merman. Others considered: Bette Davis, Lauren Bacall, Judy Garland, Beatrice Lillie, Judy Garland. Composer Jerry Herman chose Lansbury.The opening on May 24, 1966, was a sensation. One critic wondered that ""the movies' worn, plump old harridan with a snakepit for a mouth"" could turn out to be ""the liveliest dame to kick up her heels since Carol Channing in 'Hello, Dolly.'""After her ""Sweeney Todd"" triumph, Lansbury returned to Hollywood to try television. She was offered a sitcom with Charles Durning or ""Murder, She Wrote."" The producers had wanted Jean Stapleton, who declined. Lansbury accepted.During the series' long run, she managed to star in TV movies, to be host of Emmy and Tony shows and even to provide the voice for a Disney animated feature. She played Mrs. Potts in ""Beauty and the Beast"" and sang the title song. ""This was really a breakthrough for me,"" she said of her young following. ""It acquainted me with a generation that I possibly couldn't have contacted.""In 2000, Lansbury withdrew from a planned Broadway musical, ""The Visit,"" because she needed to help her husband recover from heart surgery. ""The kind of commitment required of an artist carrying a multimillion-dollar production has to be 100%,"" she said in a letter to the producers.Her husband died in 2003.She was back on Broadway in 2012 in a revival of ""The Best Man,"" sharing a stage with James Earl Jones, John Larroquette, Candice Bergen, Eric McCormack, Michael McKean and Kerry Butler. She also recently co-starred in Emma Thompson's ""Nanny McPhee"" and with Jim Carrey in ""Mr. Popper's Penguins.""At the 2022 Tony Awards, Len Cariou — her ""Sweeney Todd"" co-star — accepted the lifetime Tony given to Lansbury. ""There is no one with whom I'd rather run a cutthroat business with,"" Cariou said.In 1990, Lansbury philosophized: ""I have sometimes drawn back from my career. To what? Home. Home is the counterweight to the work.""In addition to her three children, Anthony, Deirdre and David, she is survived by three grandchildren, Peter, Katherine and Ian, plus five great grandchildren and her brother, producer Edgar Lansbury."

/sports/cricket/news/we-were-always-behind-the-game-shakib-3140736,We were always behind in the game: Shakib,"Bangladesh Test and T20I skipper Shakib Al Hasan admitted that the Tigers were always behind in their chase of a steep target against New Zealand in their T20I tri-nation series encounter in Christchurch on Wednesday. Chasing a mammoth 209-run target, Bangladesh were restricted to 160 for seven despite a fifty from skipper Shakib.""New Zealand put on a very good total and we were always behind in the game. But we should have scored maybe 15-20 more runs to close down the gap more as that would have been ideal,"" Shakib said at the post-match presentation following their 48-run loss to New Zealand that saw the Tigers crash out of the Tri-nation series. Shakib pointed out the area the Tigers have been struggling in recently.  ""We kept on losing wickets in the middle and that cost us the game. If you look at our last three games, it has been the same pattern. After 10 overs, we have been losing wickets consistently. We lose wickets every two overs and that is not helping us in getting the momentum and we are left forcing to build innings,"" Shakib added. Bangladesh got off to a promising start on a sporting wicket at the Hagley Oval today. The Tigers, despite losing both their openers, scored 52 in the Powerplay -- the most they have scored in the first six overs in the series. But the Tigers lost way in the middle. Bangladesh were 90 for two approaching the halfway stage of the game. From there, the Tigers lost wickets in a cluster and were reduced to five for 120 in 14.2 overs. Shakib fought valiantly but his 44-ball 70 did not amount to much as no other batter could capitalise on their starts. Bangladesh have one more game to play -- against Pakistan tomorrow -- in the series. And Shakib hoped to end the series on a positive note ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia later this month.  
 
""We are not that far [from forming a settled playing eleven], we have a few areas we need to fix. Actually, we do not have many options to be honest.

/entertainment/music/news/the-iris-dads-the-parks-new-single-out-now-3140891,‘Into the Iris’: Dads in the Park’s new single out now,"Dads in the Park is a two-man project comprised of Ishmam Salim and Tajwar Ul Islam. The duo took the indie scene by storm upon the release of their first song, ""Lullaby"". Since then, they continued to give their fans one amazing song after the next.Their latest single, ""Into the Iris"" follows on that trajectory, giving fans another song to add to their favourite playlist. However, the band has decided to explore a somewhat new sound with this particular song.""Into the Iris"" isn't one of those songs that you don't skip if it come ups on your shuffled playlist. The moment the first note hits, you're likely to be encaptivated by Ishmam's, almost-angelic, voice. Add to that the sweet acoustic guitar strums—almost bordering on sounding like a ukulele—and you've got a perfect opening to complement the vocals.But truly, the best part of the song is bass. In the song's official music video, which was released on the same day, it can be seen that Tajwar is the one playing the bass. If he is the one that came up with the bassline, then one must give props to the man for writing what might be one of the catchiest basslines I've heard all year.The medley of Ishmam's vocals are all mixed together perfectly, giving complex layers that complement each other, but sound simple to the ear. All of the lyrics also perfectly suit the sound, making for a well-rounded single that I am sure will become one of their top songs going forward.The song's music video was also wonderfully directed, with beautiful sets. Rakin Absar was also featured in the music video."
/opinion/editorial/news/karnaphuli-river-being-robbed-life-one-species-time-3141041,"Karnaphuli River is being robbed of life, one species at a time","Dumping of toxic waste into rivers has become something of a norm in Bangladesh where there is no accountability for those who do it. But are the authorities aware of the long-term effects of their lax monitoring which is allowing this indiscriminate pollution of rivers? A research team from Chattogram University, in collaboration with a local environmental organisation, has recently revealed that as many as 81 species of plants on the banks of Karnaphuli River are in danger of going extinct over the next few decades. Another 61 species of plants, as per their study, are at risk of becoming endangered if no action is taken to prevent pollution. Moreover, researchers have found that the movement of dolphins in the river is also being disrupted.If these revelations are not disturbing enough, know that 35 out of 140 species of fish are no longer present in the river because of its continued pollution, as per a report by the Department of Environment (DoE) in Chattogram. This is the state of just one river in one region. Imagine the state of other rivers going through the same ordeal.Perhaps the most well-known victims of industrial pollution and encroachment are Dhaka's rivers. The level of mismanagement that these waterbodies have been put through boggles the mind. In many places, demarcation pillars, installed along the banks to signal their boundaries, have been turned into relics due to unabated encroachment. In many areas, fish and other aquatic animals have been driven away by the contamination from disposal of untreated waste. Across the country, a number of rivers and canals have disappeared thanks to pollution and encroachment. There is no shortage of examples to illustrate the woeful state of our rivers. How can they – and we, being dependent on them – survive if industries, individuals and even government agencies are allowed to suffocate them like this?Unfortunately, all this is going on despite the authorities having enough information to stop the encroachers and polluters. In 2018-19, the National River Conservation Commission made a list of 57,390 encroachers in all 64 districts – of them, only 32 percent were reportedly evicted so far. In Chattogram, the district administration has a list of 2,112 grabbers along a 40km stretch of the Karnaphuli river. But the relevant authorities have repeatedly failed to comply with court directives to remove illegal structures. Meanwhile, these encroachers – among them politically linked individuals and industrial units – continue to pollute the river and kill its ecosystem.We urge the higher authorities to crack down on those slowly killing our rivers. For too long, responsible government agencies have either done too little or conveniently shifted their responsibility onto others, which cannot be tolerated any longer. It is high time the authorities, including local administrations and agencies responsible for river protection, undertook serious efforts to stop pollution and encroachment of rivers. We must save them for our own sake."
/business/economy/news/vibrant-bond-market-needed-curb-npls-fbcci-3140381,Vibrant bond market needed to curb NPLs: FBCCI,"The government should declare that it will develop the bond market on a priority basis to reduce the pressure on banks for long-term financing, bring down non-performing loans, and provide people with a low-risk investment tool, according to business leaders.Developing the bond market would also help finance the huge amounts of investment the public and private sectors will need in the coming years, they said.These views came at a seminar, styled ""Bond Market: The Ultimate Solution for Long-term Financing"", organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) at its premises in Dhaka yesterday.The stock market is only composed of equities, but a developed bond market is much needed to diversify the investment tools available, said Salman F Rahman, the prime minister's adviser on private industry and investment affairs.""So, the government has taken the initiative to make the bond market vibrant,"" he added.Rahman said raising awareness of the benefits and ensuring good prices are crucial for making the bond market popular.""If the bond market becomes popular, the dependence on banks for funding will decrease. This will minimise the risk of NPLs, which is one of the biggest challenges in the financial sector,"" said FBCCI President Md Jashim Uddin.Bangladesh currently lacks long-term financing sources as it is tough for banks to provide such loans as they deal with short-term deposits.""So, the bond market can be an effective solution for long-term financing,"" he added.Prof Shibli Rubayat-Ul-Islam, chairman of the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC), said perpetual bonds have already been introduced in the stock market.""When other bonds become available, they will be more popular among investors,"" he added.Islam went on to say that the International Finance Corporation has expressed interest in introducing a bond of $4 billion in Bangladesh.In addition, the BSEC plans to allow more bonds for women entrepreneurs, small and micro entrepreneurs, and new entrepreneurs, he said.The bond market in Bangladesh is still very small as it accounts for only 8 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, which is much lower than most neighbouring nations, said Arif Khan, vice-chairman of Shanta Asset Management.The bond market also has significant importance in financing government projects and the national budget, ensuring long-term financing for companies, better NPL management, and lucrative investment options for investors, he added, while presenting a keynote at the seminar.The huge time required to issue a bond, the fluctuation in bank interest rates, and excessive regulations on trustee registration are marked as obstacles in the bond market.Bonds currently have a minimum transaction requirement of Tk 100,000 in the capital market with a transaction fee of Tk 1,000.""So, the lot size should be reduced along with the transaction fee,"" Khan said.Khan said a holistic approach is needed to promote the bond market, the development of which should be a priority work for the finance ministry.""Also, an effective benchmark yield curve is needed while the time needed to issue a bond should be reduced.""Mostofa Azad Chowdhury Babu, senior vice president of the FBCCI, Shuvra Kanti Choudhury, managing director and CEO of Central Depository Bangladesh Ltd, Richard D' Rozario, president of the DSE Brokers Association of Bangladesh, Mohammed Nasir Uddin Chowdhury, a former president of the Bangladesh Merchant Bankers Association, Shakil Rizvi, a director of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, and Amzad Hussain, chairman of the stock market and bond-related standing committee of the FBCCI, also spoke at the event."
