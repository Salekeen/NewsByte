/sports/cricket/news/babar-rizwans-maxim-liton-3142386,Babar-Rizwan’s maxim for Liton,"Liton Das was in excellent touch during a 42-ball 69 against Pakistan yesterday but he might have been disappointed to get out in the 15th over after an 88-run stand with Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan.Liton was later seen speaking to Pakistan openers Mohammad Rizwan and skipper Babar Azam in a video posted by the Pakistan Cricket Board on Facebook, titled 'Learning never stops'.Liton had a few queries, especially relating to mentality, after the two Pakistani batters put on a 101-run stand to help their side to a seven-wicket win against the Tigers in Christchurch yesterday.It appeared Babar Azam had a few sharp pieces of advice for Liton. ""The less you listen and do what you feel, it will be right. Because even if you don't want, you will start doubting yourself listening to everyone,"" the Pakistan skipper was heard telling Liton.Rizwan, currently the number one-ranked T20I batter, divulged tips for a few mental aspects too. The Pakistani duo had built their innings calmly and prescribed confidence in one's own abilities.""You may score zero, 10 or even a century, but nothing is possible without hard work. If you do something different with your team, results might be different. Then there are those who are mentally strong, like Shakib,"" Rizwan explained.""You and I know that catches will be dropped and centuries will be made. And you will become a big player. Liton Das is a big player. Rizwan was dropped and he became player of the match. But if the catch was taken, that wouldn't have happened.""Liton then asked how to banish a lean phase. ""You get ready for one thing, which is that there will be 10 innings that will make you sweat. There will also be 10 innings where I can score 20 runs in 12 balls if needed. But the big player, due to their calmness, will be successful in six out of 10 innings,"" Rizwan said.Liton had plenty to ponder and the opener will be hoping such positivity can usher him to new heights."

/tech-startup/news/masterpieces-seconds-the-wondrous-world-ai-art-3142471,Masterpieces in seconds: The wondrous world of AI art,"Art has always been a very subjective matter of interpretation. Revolutionary post-impressionist Vincent van Gogh was known to have said, ""Art is to console those who are broken by life."" Fast forward 150 years, and we see art being created by something with no ""life"" of its own. Philosophical conjecture aside, AI-generated art certainly has gained a massive surge in usage popularity lately, and doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon.Owing to many free (and paid) easy-to-use AI art generators, it is now possible for anyone to create a piece of artwork from scratch. No pens, pencils, brushes, or canvas needed. Just type in whatever you want a drawing of, and the mighty power of artificial intelligence will create paintings for you in seconds. While many hesitate to call AI-generated artwork anything remotely close to masterpieces, one cannot deny the amazing power of technology when you type in prompts like ""bird eye view of a cabin on a snowy mountain, expressionist style"" and get results that could easily be mistaken for a human-drawn piece of art.The first recorded instance of AI-generated art stems back to 1973, from a computer program called AARON written by the British artist Harold Cohen. The program, which enabled a machine to draw images on a large canvas, ran on specific rules set by Cohen. The machine drew according to what the artist had stated, using algorithmic calculations to decide its strokes. Despite Cohen working on AARON's development until his final breath, the program remained true to its most basic function: performing tasks specifically instructed by the user, with no self-generated creative input or autonomy involved in the painting process.Modern breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have enabled machines to go further than simple imitation. Ahmed Elgammal, Director of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers, stated in an article from American Scientist that current AI-art generators use a process called algorithmic art that doesn't only follow a set of predetermined rules, but also learn new ways to generate an image by analysing thousands of existing images. After the artist has fed the AI a large collection of portraits, paintings and artworks of different styles and techniques, the AI is able to self-learn new aesthetics to produce original sets of images on its own. Free AI art generators such as Stable Diffusion uses large-scale databases like LAION-5B, which consists of over 580 billion image-text pairs publicly accessible on the internet.There are both free and paid versions of AI art generators out there, and while some of the most popular ones come with limited free uses, they are still worth trying out if it's your first time dabbing into this world of wonder. Here are some free (and limited) AI art generators you can try out.Stable Diffusion is a completely free text-to-image generator that creates artwork based on what prompt you type. You can go from something as simple as ""a cat dancing"" to more complex prompts such as ""a man wearing trenchcoat, middle of rain, crying, contemplating life, British, postmodern style"". Stable Diffusion automatically generates a maximum of 4 images, with each image measuring 512x512. For a free art generator, it tends to lag at times but still works surprisingly fast given you can use it anytime for completely zero cost.DALL-E 2 is one of the most popular AI art generators currently, and for good reason. It creates fast, unique paintings from extremely detailed prompts, producing up to 4 high-quality 1024x1024 size images for each prompt. However, it is not completely free, as generating art from a prompt requires a credit each. You get 50 free credits during your first month, after that, you will get 15 free credits every month. The least amount of credits you can buy is 115, which costs US$15.Currently available only as a Discord bot, Midjourney is one of the better AI art generators on the internet, capable of producing amazing high-contrast artwork in very little time. Unlike most other AI art generators, Midjourney has an easier time processing human faces and is exceptionally proficient at creating original sceneries and landscape paintings. After generating a set of images, you can also ask the bot to upscale or produce more variations. Unfortunately, Midjourney has limited free uses, with 25 queries available for trial users.DreamStudio is a fun art generator that allows the user to freely set width, height, Cfg scale (how close the image is to your prompt), diffusion steps and diffusion sampler of the generated images.NightCafe is another interesting one that is great for producing artwork based on specific styles such as CGI, pop art, anime, black and white portrait, etc.WomboDream is similar to NightCafe, in that it also allows a variety of styles to incorporate into the prompt, including but not limited to isometric, retro-futurism, analogue and realistic.To note, these three art generators can be used for free using free credits (that usually refills every day) but continued usage will cost money.Nonetheless, all of these AI-based art generators can be a fun time and an exciting new way to gather new, original artwork for projects, research and everyday use."
/health/health-alert/news/dengue-claims-8-lives-day-3142191,Dengue claims 8 lives in a day,"Eight dengue patients died, while 765 were admitted to hospitals across the country yesterday.These are the highest single-day numbers recorded this year.Total dengue cases crossed the 23,000 mark, the third-highest number witnessed since the first outbreak in Bangladesh in 2000.A total of 1,01,354 dengue cases, the highest, were recorded in 2019, and 28,429 in 2021. The death tolls were 179 and 105, respectively.According to the Directorate General of Health Services, 23,282 dengue patients, 5,205 from outside Dhaka, have been hospitalised across the country this year so far.This year's death toll has now risen to 83. Of the deceased, 28 died in the first 13 days of October alone.Experts urged authorities to immediately conduct extensive drives to identify clusters of Aedes mosquitoes.Yesterday at a press briefing in the capital's Mohakhali, Prof Ahmedul Kabir, additional director general (administration) of DGHS, said the highest number of dengue cases have been witnessed in Cox's Bazar, during the current season.The number of deaths is high outside Dhaka. Most of them died three days after hospitalisation, he said.DGHS has instructed authorities to prepare more hospitals for dengue treatment.Entomologist Prof Kabirul Bashar of Jahangirnagar University said every year in October, dengue cases start going down. But this time, the numbers will keep rising.It is not possible to control dengue without managing mosquito hotspots. This year, authorities took inadequate measures to find and manage these sites, said Kabirul.""Hotspot management means identifying risky houses and areas by collecting addresses of dengue patients,"" he explained. Authorities will have to kill adult Aedes mosquitoes and their larvae at these sites, and build awareness among residents.Entomologist GM Saifur Rahman of Bangladesh National University said as short-term activities, authorities will have to conduct surveys in risky areas to find dengue patients who show mild symptoms and bring them under care.They will also have to conduct intensive control operations in those areas to kill mosquitoes and build public awareness. The public should also take personal measures to protect themselves by using mosquito repellent and wearing clothes that cover arms, he said.Last month, Dhaka North City Corporation Chief Health Officer Brig Gen Md Zobaidur Rahman said apart from regular and special drives, they have purchased 30 boats to clean waterbodies and use insecticides properly.Md Abu Nasher, public relations officer of Dhaka South City Corporation, said besides routine drives, they are taking different measures to control Aedes mosquitoes, including drives around houses of dengue patients."

/sports/football/news/reigning-saff-champions-make-waves-fifa-rankings-3142656,Reigning SAFF champions make waves in FIFA rankings,"Bangladesh moved up seven places in the latest women's football rankings released by FIFA on Thursday, following their maiden SAFF Championship triumph last month.According to the latest ranking -- which was updated after August 05 – the women in red and green improved their position from 147 to 140, having gained 37.39 points during the timeframe. In the process, Bangladesh went ahead of the likes of Namibia, Benin, American Samoa, Lebanon, Tajikistan, Angola, and Burkina Faso.  Featuring a total of 23 goals in five matches while conceding only one, the Sabina Khatun-led side were on a rampant run in the SAFF tournament as they shrugged off their group-stage opponents -- including Maldives, Pakistan, and India, who fell three places in ranking from 58 – before crushing Bhutan in the semi-final and downing the then 102-rank hosts Nepal in the grand finale at the Dasarath Rangasala stadium.While the jump in ranking position may appear to be underwhelming -- considering Bangladesh managed to beat a couple of high-rank teams, and that too on away grounds in a competitive tournament – however, in terms of points gained, only two teams --- Portugal (54.19) and Republic of Ireland (44.20), ranked 23 and 24, respectively -- have managed to display higher digits than Bangladesh. In Asia, however, Bangladesh lead the pack, followed by 157-rank Syria with 21.82.Apart from Bangladesh, Estonia accumulated 36.64 points to make a significant jump as they entered the top 100 by moving up 10 spots to occupy the 96th position, while Portugal and Ireland moved up four and two places, respectively.    Meanwhile, USA, the defending World Cup champions, sit pretty at the top, ahead of Sweden, Germany, England, France, in that order.        "

The final will begin at 08:00am (BST).In yesterday's game, skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Liton Das scored brisk fifties to help Bangladesh post a competitive 173 for six. But Pakistan openers Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan continued their excellent form, stitching together a 101-run stand, before Mohammad Nawaz's 20-ball 45-run blitz took them over the line with one ball to spare.With Bangladesh's persistent struggles in the batting department in the shortest format, Shakib's 42-ball 68 and Liton's 69 off 42 balls may still have come as relief to the team management just days ahead of the marquee T20 event in Australia.Bangladesh will leave for Australia tomorrow but T20I skipper Shakib will leave a day earlier, on Friday, to be available for the captains' official photo session before the T20 World Cup kicks off on October 16.Bangladesh are scheduled to play two warm-ups matches in Brisbane against Afghanistan on October 17 and South Africa on October 19 before beginning their World Cup campaign with a Super 12 fixture against the runners-up from Group A on October 24 in Hobart."

/daily-star-books/news/rahitul-islams-novels-reflect-digital-bangladesh-3141951,Rahitul Islam's novels reflect Digital Bangladesh ,"Rahitul Islam's latest novel, Call Centerer Aparajita (Prothoma Prokashani, 2022), recounts the sorrows and hardships of Aparajita, a woman who works in a call center. Islam also appeared in the news recently when he handed over his royalty earnings from the book to Prothom Alo Trust for helping two disadvantaged individuals. A source revealed that the young writer donates his initial royalty earnings from every book. A portion of the donation has been given to Sanjida Akter of Natore for the treatment of her eyes. Akter was the victim of an acid attack in November last year. The remaining portion of the donation has been given to Md. Shaheen Alam, a Dhaka University student, who is visually impaired. A zoom account has been purchased for Shaheen Alam to continue uninterrupted online training in Microsoft Office, which is being provided to visually impaired students in Bangladesh and abroad Rahitul Islam started reporting on the ICT sector in 2009. Noticing that people are less aware of this industry, he also penned down the stories of the ICT sector in books such as Outsourcing O Bhalobasar Golpo (2018), Charer Master Computer Engineer (2020), Kemon Achen Freelancer Nadia? (2019), Freelancer Sumoner Din Raat (2020), Hello Daktar Apa (2021) and Bhalobasar Hatbazar (2020). The writer, who has published 11 books so far, remembers two individuals who have greatly inspired his writing: former justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman and poet Rafiq Azad. Quite a few telefilms have been made out of his stories. Outsourcing O Bhalobasar Golpo (2018), starring Afran Nisho and Tanjin Tisha, was adapted from the novel of the same name. The novel recognises and sheds light on the work of about 600,000 freelancers working in the country. The telefilm Chorer Master (2021), featuring Khairul Bashar and Safa Kabir, was based on the novel Chorer Master Computer Engineer. This year, the telefilm Freelancer Nadia (2022), starring Mahzabin Chowdhury, was adapted from the novel Kemon Achen Freelancer Nadia? Zunaid Ahmed Palak, the State Minister for Information and Communication Technology Division, has played a special character in this telefilm exploring women's empowerment. Rahitul Islam has been working on a book titled The Heroes of ICT Sector for the past four years. The book is about individuals who have contributed to the ICT sector but are yet to receive their due respect. Islam believes that it will be a realistic documentation of the ICT sector of Bangladesh. Experience in journalism—which includes reporting for Prothom Alo—works as an advantage for his writing, Islam shares. He recently wrote about Garo youths who work as freelancers from the forest adjacent to the village of Gayra, which is located in Modhupur of Tangail district. Despite having the potential to earn dollars, they were constrained by slow internet connection. When it was reported in the front page of Prothom Alo, an internet service provider in Dhaka named Amber IT came forward with provision of a fast internet connection in the Gayra village. Grameenphone set up a network tower there and the government set up a computer lab, distributing laptops free of cost. Nearly 40 villages in Modhupur are going to avail the benefits of Digital Bangladesh. Rahitul Islam believes that he has been able to write about a few of these success stories. Hundreds of stories remain. The author wants to inspire many more youths by documenting the stories of the ICT sector.  "

What is left for us is to turn our attention quickly to Sunday's El Clasico (against Real Madrid), bounce back and focus on LaLiga because the Champions League became very difficult and complicated for us.""Until last year, Barca had advanced to at least the round of 16 in the Champions League in every season since 2001, but are now facing the prospect of slipping into the Europa League for the second season in a row.Roared on by their fans in a sold-out Camp Nou, Barcelona started strongly, with Raphinha the focal point of their attack and Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana made three fine stops from strikes by the Brazilian.But just like last week in Milan, Inter were strong on the counter-attack in the first half and went close to scoring on three occasions.Edin Dzeko thundered a close-range strike off the post in the 17th minute, Henrikh Mkhitaryan had a long-range shot denied by Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who also denied Denzel Dumfries in a one-on-one from a counter-attack.In a move started by Raphinha on the right touchline, the Spanish side took the lead through a close-range strike by Ousmane Dembele from a Sergi Roberto cross five minutes from halftime.But it all changed after the break when Nicolo Barella levelled in the 50th minute with a volley from Alessandro Bastoni's cross after ghosting in behind the Barcelona defence.A Lautaro Martinez strike from the edge of the area that bounced off both posts before going in put Inter ahead 13 minutes later and they could have extended their lead at least twice but were denied by Ter Stegen.With Barcelona in all-out attack mode, Lewandowski equalised from a rebound in the 82nd minute.Inter regained the lead one minute from time when Robin Gosens finished off a counter-attack but Lewandowski's bullet header three minutes later rescued Barca who are third in the Group C standings on four points, three behind Inter and eight adrift of Bayern Munich.""Soccer is a game of mistakes and we can't afford those in situations like this,"" Xavi said.""This is the Champions League and you pay a high price for each error you make.""You need to win, to defend well, to score. We needed to play the entire game like we did in the first half. That intensity. Now it's hard because we are not in control anymore."""

Ministers, government officials, persons with disabilities, civil society and private sector allies from Asia and the Pacific will gather on October 19-21 in Jakarta to mark the birth of a new era for 700 million persons with disabilities, and proclaim a fourth Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities.
Our region is unique, having already declared three decades to protect and uphold the rights of persons with disabilities. Forty-four Asian and Pacific governments have ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and we celebrate achievements in the development of disability laws, policies, strategies, and programmes.
Today, we have more parliamentarians and policymakers with disabilities. Their everyday business is national decision-making. They also monitor policy implementation. We find them active across the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, Bangladesh, China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Türkiye. They have promoted inclusive public procurement to support disability-inclusive businesses and accessible facilities, advanced sign language interpretation in media programmes and parliamentary sessions, focused policy attention on overlooked groups, and directed numerous policy initiatives towards inclusion.
Less visible but no less important are local-level elected politicians with disabilities in India, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Indonesia witnessed 42 candidates with disabilities standing in the last election. Grassroots disability organisations have emerged as rapid responders to emerging issues such as Covid-19 and other crises. Organisations of and for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh have distinguished themselves in disability-inclusive Covid-19 responses, and created programmes to support persons with psychosocial disabilities and autism.
The past decade saw the emergence of private sector leadership in disability-inclusive business. Wipro, headquartered in India, pioneers disability inclusion in its multinational growth strategy. This is a pillar of Wipro's diversity and inclusion initiatives. Employees with disabilities are at the core of designing and delivering Wipro digital services.
Yet, there is always more unfinished business to address. Even though we applaud the increasing participation of persons with disabilities in policymaking, there are still only eight persons with disabilities for every 1,000 parliamentarians in the region. On the right to work, three in four persons with disabilities are not employed, while seven in 10 persons with disabilities do not enjoy any form of social protection.
This sobering picture points to the need for disability-specific and disability-inclusive policies and their sustained implementation in partnership with women and men with disabilities.
One of the first steps to inclusion is recognising the rights of persons with disabilities. This model focuses on the person and their dignity, aspirations, individuality and value as a human being. As such, government offices, banks and public transportation and spaces must be made accessible for persons with diverse disabilities. To this end, governments in the region have conducted accessibility audits of government buildings and public transportation stations. Partnerships with the private sector have led to reasonable accommodations at work, promoting employment in a variety of sectors.
Despite the thrust of the Incheon Strategy on data collection and analysis, persons with disabilities still are often left out of official data, because the questions that allow for disaggregation are excluded from surveys, and accommodations are not made to ensure their participation. This reflects a continued lack of policy priority and budgetary allocations. To create evidence-based policies, we need reliable and comparable data disaggregated by disability status, sex and geographic location.
There is hope in the technology leap to 5G in the Asia-Pacific region. The implications for the empowerment of individuals are limitless: from digital access, e-healthcare and assistive devices at affordable prices to remote learning and working, and exercising the right to vote. This is a critical moment to ensure disability-inclusive digitalisation.
We live in a world of volatile change. A disability-inclusive approach to shape this world would benefit everyone, particularly in a rapidly ageing Asia-Pacific region where everyone's contributions will matter. As we stand on the precipice of a fourth Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities, it remains our duty to insist on a paradigm shift to celebrate diversity and disability inclusion. When we dismantle barriers and persons with disabilities surge ahead, everyone benefits.

/tech-startup/news/how-teaching-ielts-can-be-trickier-teaching-general-english-3142371,How teaching IELTS can be trickier than teaching General English,"The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) test is for those who want to study abroad or seek professional registration. It is popularly known as a test that measures language proficiency for both studies and works in any university or organisation with English as the primary language. However, teaching or learning IELTS tests may not be the same as teaching or learning general English. A new episode of the LIVE webinar series of The Daily Star in collaboration with the British Council titled 'Does teaching IELTS and exams differ from teaching General English?' aired live on 4 October 2022. The webinar was led by Wendy Naylor, Consultant at The British Council, where she had an interactive discussion with the online audience regarding IELTS and General English.IELTS is taken by those who want to demonstrate their level of English. This test has four parts: listening, reading, writing and speaking. Wendy said, ""When we are teaching General English, we want our students to learn all these four skills so that there is a proper overlap. But when teaching IELTS, we structure our lessons and incorporate these skills to match the test. As an IELTS teacher, I need to ensure that my students understand how these skills will be tested in the exam."" 'Take IELTS' is a British Council website that is a useful resource for teachers in guiding learners. You can access lesson plans and videos, as well as information about the test, available here.According to Wendy, it is important to teach students about the types of questions in an IELTS exam. ""In a listening test,"" she demonstrated, by explaining there are different types of questions, which test your language ability in different ways. Understanding how the different questions work helps to test takers achieve the best result they can. For the writing part, they need to use different words to show their knowledge regarding the language.""While talking about time management during the exam, Wendy advised, ""In an IELTS reading test, you need to answer 40 questions within an hour of time. The questions get more and more difficult. So, learn to skim the questions to answer the easier ones quickly to save time.""To take an IELTS test, a student must have a good command of English, stated Wendy. If they do not have that, they should do a General English course before practising for the test. ""The listening test can be tricky since you will listen to different speakers with different accents. To improve your listening, you can do fun activities like listening to music or watching YouTube videos or TED Talks, or try activities on the British Council's website.""In response to the question of whether practising Cambridge English is enough to have a good score on the IELTS test, Wendy said, ""For the writing part, then you can obviously use the vast set of vocabularies that you learn in Cambridge English. But if you are studying for IELTS or teaching it, I highly recommend using IELTS-based materials, simply because Cambridge Exams are different."" She added that the perfect IELTS course is going to have a balance between exam practice and general English. You can only demonstrate your level of English, so if you are not at the level of your desired score you won't achieve your goal. Students can be involved in self-study set by the teachers as well for better preparation, including providing access to different recordings to practise listening and papers to practise reading. ""Make sure that your students practise reading instructions. Due to stress, they often forget to read the basic instructions or keywords that may lead them to make mistakes,"" advised Wendy. Some of her other advice included: practising correct spellings using Quizlet, speaking with other people in English to practise speaking, and learning more vocabulary and grammar for the writing part. In reply to how many hours one should spend towards IELTS preparation, she explained that to improve by one CEFR level, Cambridge recommends 200 hours. However, students whose level of English is aligned with the CEFR framework and desired IELTS score should spend around 20-30 hours preparing for the test."

Kim has overseen a blitz of ballistic missile launches in recent weeks, which Pyongyang has described as tactical nuclear drills that simulated taking out airports and military facilities across South Korea. The cruise missiles -- which travel at lower altitudes than ballistic missiles, making them harder to detect and intercept -- flew 2,000 kilometres (1,240 miles) over the sea before hitting their targets, the Korean Central News Agency said. Kim made acquiring tactical nukes -- smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use -- a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021."
/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/russia-evacuate-annexed-kherson-residents-ukraine-advances-3142641,Russia to evacuate “annexed” Kherson as Ukraine advances,"In a sign that continuing and sustained Ukrainian military gains along the southern front are worrying the Kremlin, Russia is promising free accommodation to residents of the partially occupied Kherson region who want to evacuate to Russia.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin made the announcement shortly after the Russia-backed leader of Kherson, one of four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Moscow last month, asked the Kremlin to organize an evacuation from four cities in the region.""Cities of the Kherson region — Kherson and Nova Kakhovka, Hola Prystan and Chornobaivka — are subject to daily missile strikes,"" Vladimir Saldo said in a video posted online Thursday. ""These missile strikes cause serious damage, first and foremost to the residents. Among targets missiles hit are hotels, residential buildings, markets — (places) where there are lots of civilians.""Saldo said a decision has been made to evacuate Kherson residents to the Russian regions of Rostov, Krasnodar and Stavropol, as well as the annexed Crimea.""I would like to ask you to help organize this process. We, residents of the Kherson region, of course know that Russia doesn't abandon their own, and Russia always offers a hand,"" Saldo said.His plea comes as Ukrainian forces push their counteroffensive deeper into the southern Kherson region, albeit at a slower pace.The move comes as the Ukrainian military continues to make gains in the south. Ukrainian armed forces have reported steady territorial gains along the southern front, including the recapture of 75 settlements in the Kherson region in the last month, the Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories said late Thursday night.In the east, Ukraine's armed forces have recaptured 502 settlements in the Kharkiv region, 43 in the Donetsk region and seven in the Luhansk region, the ministry said.Saldo's deputy, Kirill Stremousov, in his own statement tried to play down the announcement, saying that ""no one's retreating ... no one is planning to leave the territory of the Kherson region.""Earlier on Thursday, the British military said on Twitter that ""the Russian occupation authorities have likely ordered preparation for the evacuation of some civilians from Kherson.""""It is likely that they anticipate combat extending to the city of Kherson itself,"" the British Defense Ministry said.Early Friday, Russia continued its targeted attacks on critical infrastructure across Ukraine, a strategy that started Monday, when a massive, coordinated attack on nearly every region in the country was said to be carried out in retaliation for the explosion on a Moscow-funded bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland.Multiple Russian missile strikes shook the Zaphorizhzhia region capital overnight as the city continued to be a focal point while Ukraine pushed its counteroffensive on the southern front.Zaporizhzhia regional Governor Oleksandr Starukh said several explosions were reported in the city overnight at infrastructure facilities, causing fires. There were no victims in preliminary reports, and further details about specific damage were unavailable. Russian forces have struck the regional capital and surrounding area continuously in recent days and weeks, creating concerns about the safety of the nearby nuclear power plant.The regional capital is about 100 miles from the plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Two days ago, it was forced to revert to diesel-fueled generator power to maintain its reactor cooling systems after an attack on a substation's communication line was lost during fighting in the area.Missile, drone and rocket attacks on Ukraine have kept the country on edge with air raid sirens occurring more frequently and bringing a heightened sense of urgency after Monday's strike killed 19 and wounded more than 100, including many in the capital, Kyiv."

/sports/cricket/news/could-hathursingha-tonic-work-soumya-again-3142401,Could Hathurusingha tonic work on Soumya again?,"When Soumya Sarkar came onto the international scene, his impact was felt fairly quickly. His ability to dictate terms and put fear in the opposition ranks were traits that best showcased his attributes.Eight years down the line, the carnage that he wrought against the likes of South Africa and Pakistan seems to be missing a few punches. The definitive factor is the confidence level that the left-hander has portrayed, oftentimes being moved down the order for the purpose of the team or following off-colour performances.Sri Lankan coach Chandika Hathurusingha, who oversaw the Tigers as head coach from 2014 to 2017, was able to get the best out of Soumya with a tonic of confidence. It appears current technical consultant Sridharan Sriram might replicate such a remedy.Chandika was known as a strict professional, micro-managing various details during his tenure and keeping a tight leash on things. However, he had a simple message regarding the left-hander's approach. ""You may get out, but don't change your approach"" was the gist of that message.Soumya, given the licence to play his natural game, was able to become a match-winner for the Tigers during that period.So, with limited options and a crisis at the top becoming apparent even to the team management at this point, Soumya made a return to the Tigers' line-up in the tri-nation T20I series in New Zealand despite only making the squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup as a standby player.He started well in the New Zealand game despite struggling with the pace and bounce on offer, but he was keen on his own approach. In the second game against Pakistan yesterday, when Bangladesh slumped to a seven-wicket loss, he got just four runs. But Sriram defended his intent.""He played a shot and got out. That's intent. I think he was selfless and played for the team. He tried to get going in the first few overs when we got only six or seven runs. He tried to force the pace and got out, but it happens. He played a good knock at number three in the last game so I think there are good signs. With a player like him, we need to really instill confidence,"" Sriram said after the game yesterday.It is evident that Soumya is being backed to go about his natural game. Whether that confidence boost can work its way to him making the T20 World Cup squad remains to be seen, but Sriram was open to change.""We still have time. We have two more days. There will definitely be discussions and I said this earlier, we're open to changes but we're very clear in our heads as to what we want. We will let you know in a few days,"" he said about whether there were any impending changes to the World Cup squad.""We do have trust. This is our best group. Those who are here with us are the best from Bangladesh and we have complete faith in that.""The Tigers finished without a win in the tri-nation series but played both Soumya and pacer Shoriful Islam, both of whom are stand-by options for the T20 World Cup, leading to Sriram maintaining that combinations were still being worked out.He clarified that the opening slots and batting position did not matter because they would keep ""modifying"" and ""adapting"" according to conditions and scenarios. There is every bit of chance of changes taking place, especially with Sabbir Rahman not having produced the necessary impact. For Soumya meanwhile, the Sriram tonic could be a chance to revive his game.The Tigers will head to Australia and play two World Cup warm-up matches on October 17 and 19 against Afghanistan and South Africa respectively. They take the positives of skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Liton Das's form at the top. Soumya's fast hand could just add that X-factor."

The log referenced drafts of a May 13 email to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a slide presentation to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).""This game of 'hide the ball' must end,"" the company said in the court filing.The court filing, which asked Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick to order Musk's attorneys to provide the documents, was made on Oct. 6 - the same day that McCormick paused litigation between the two sides after Musk reversed course and said he would proceed with the deal.Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told Reuters that Twitter's court filing was a ""misdirection"" and asserted: ""It is Twitter's executives that are under federal investigation.""Twitter declined to comment on Spiro's statement. It also declined comment when asked by Reuters about its understanding of any investigation into Musk.The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the FTC declined to comment.The SEC has questioned Musk's comments about the Twitter acquisition, including whether a 9% stake he had built up before announcing his bid had been disclosed late and why it indicated that he intended to be a passive shareholder. Musk later refiled the disclosure to indicate he was an active investor.In June, the SEC asked Musk in a letter whether he should have amended his public filing to reflect his intention to suspend or abandon the deal.The Information, a tech news site, reported in April that the FTC was scrutinizing whether Musk failed to comply with the antitrust reporting requirement relating to an investor's intentions of being a passive or active shareholder.Twitter said in June, however, that the takeover deal with Musk had cleared an antitrust waiting period for review by the FTC and U.S. Justice Department. McCormick has given Musk until Oct. 28 to close the acquisition. If the deal does not get done by then, a trial date will be set for November."

We need more days to ensure that production is in full swing,"" said Pinak Iqbal, general manager (production) of MGMCL.On April 30, the company shut its operations due to the explosives crisis.""Our production requires four types of explosives. But the reserve of explosives ran out on the night of April 30. That is why we were compelled to shut our operations,"" said Pinak.Around 650 local miners, who were appointed on a ""no-work-no-pay"" condition, were given leave indefinitely. The entire mining area took on a deserted look in the last few months, said officials and workers.Later, MGMCL officials assigned its enlisted vendor Germania Trest Consortium for importing explosives from India.The mine officials said the LC (letter of credit) was opened in May for importing the explosives, and an order to import 226 tonnes of explosives was awarded.A vehicle carrying 75 tonnes of explosives reached the mining area on Wednesday night, said Pinak.""The rest will arrive at the mining site within a week,"" he added.Mine officials said the company suffered a loss of around Tk 165 crore during these five and a half months due to the suspension.Currently, around 70 lakh tonnes of rocks are required annually in Bangladesh. Of these, around 10 lakh tonnes are produced by MGMCL, while the rest are imported, the mine officials said.Seeking anonymity, multiple officials of MGMCL said the company's production cost is much higher than its earnings, because it has been failing to produce the target amount of rocks for years.According to the company's financial statements, it incurred a loss of around Tk 433 crore in one decade (2012–2022)."

""However, we are the victims of the situation,"" he said.Some analysts are suggesting to reduce production to reduce carbon emissions. ""If we do it, our job market will be impacted,"" he pointed out.""Bangladesh has no way to sacrifice jobs in the course of maintaining environment-friendly business,"" said the commissioner.Some big buyers of European countries pay premium prices if any company uses recycled materials, pointed out Mohammad Tareq, a director of Central Counterparty Bangladesh.So, time has come to give importance on environment-friendly production, he said.Many companies have already taken up a stance on focusing environmental and governance issues in financial reports so that investors can realise how the company reacts towards the environment, sustainability and good governance, he added.Profit maximisation should not be the main goal of a company in today's world, moreover, it should be being friendly towards the environment, said Mohammed Nasir Uddin Chowdhury, managing director of LankaBangla Securities.The stock market regulator can launch a policy with some parameters so that listed companies are also categorised over their sustainability, he said.While the world is focusing on the environment the most, Bangladesh needs to give massive focus on good governance issues as it is a big problem here, said Md Moniruzzaman, managing director and CEO of IDLC Investments.Ensuring good governance has a huge impact on society, he said, adding that the government's tax collection may rise if good governance can be ensured among businesses.For instance, the government can increase its contribution to the wellbeing of the masses if it can properly secure taxes from businesses, he added.A tendency to run only after profits took over entrepreneurs since the 1990s, said AKM Nurul Fazal Bulbul, vice chairman of Central Depository Bangladesh.Now, many have changed their mindset already.

We need to develop our own human resources. We shouldn't rely on other countries for our cyber security,"" added Barkatullah.He said many big organisations use pirated software, which ultimately increases cybersecurity threats. Much of such software are unnecessary but are still used because of a lack of awareness.""Emphasis has been given to develop native technology and technology-related research to build a capable and smart Bangladesh in the future. Besides, the scope of the Cyber Incident Response Team is being extended to every sector,"" he added.Brig Gen Md Nasim Parvez, director general of the Systems and Services Division, presented a keynote at the workshop.He said it was important to use multi-factor authentication, strong passwords, a password manager and updated software while recognising and reporting phishing were equally important when it comes to seeking protection from cyber threats.Mustafa Jabbar, posts and telecommunications minister, said the issue of cyber security was very new in the context of Bangladesh and there was a lack of awareness among people.Although the government named 29 critical infrastructures to be important for the state, there is no bar on media workers availing information from these institutions, he added.Jabbar advised parents to follow parental guidelines to keep children and teenagers safe online.Shyam Sunder Sikder, chairman of the BTRC, said a large number of mobile and internet users in Bangladesh fell victim to cybercrime because they were not very skilled in technology.He said awareness should be raised about telecommunication services and cyber security at the grassroot levels.""If every educational institution conducts weekly awareness campaigns on cyber issues, it will be fruitful and the Ministry of Education should come forward for this,"" he said.According to a report of the Bangladesh government's e-Government Computer Incident Response Team (BGD e-GOV CIRT), cyber-attacks, especially ransomware attacks, have increased tremendously in Bangladesh.There were some key findings and observations for Bangladesh in the report.Two were on the fact that no organisation notified and shared information regarding their breaches/ incidents to stakeholders or customer and there are no regulations addressing the negligence of reporting and notification of cyber incidents and data breaches. In addition, there is inadequate cyber threat monitoring and detection operations within organisations.It also found that there was a lack of systematic and structured threat and incident handling capabilities within organisations and a lack of effort of senior management concerned regarding strategic decisions of cyber security capabilities development."
/opinion/editorial/news/korail-palliative-care-assistants-give-us-crucial-lesson-compassion-3142711,Korail palliative care assistants give us a crucial lesson in compassion,"It is heartwarming to learn how, as this daily has recently reported, a group of palliative care assistants (PCA) has been working to care for at least 304 patients (including 23 children) in Dhaka's Korail slum since 2019. The group currently consists of eight PCAs, three nurses, and a single doctor, and they work for Momotamoy Korail (or Compassionate Korail), a community palliative care centre which is run by the Palliative Care Society of Bangladesh (PCSB). What is most heartening is the fact that the PCAs themselves are residents of Korail, who took up this gutsy profession after training at the BSMMU for six months post their SSC completion.The patients that these PCAs care for are suffering from debilitating diseases. In most cases, not only are they themselves unable to take care of themselves, as they are bedridden with terminal illnesses, but their families also struggle to care for them properly – either due to financial incapabilities or a lack of willingness. In one case cited in our report, family members of a cancer patient would provide food to him from the door of his room, with the help of a stick, as they could not bear the odour emanating from his infections. But it was the PCAs of Momotamoy Korail who stepped forward to assist him and give him his required medicines. Besides providing 24/7 tele-consultation to their palliative patients, the PCAs also provide outpatient services to the slum's residents once a week. The name for the group is backed by the extent of their services, as they even provide bereavement support to the families of deceased patients. In our fast-paced world, where even hospitals lack the required tools, professionals, and passion to properly care for terminally ill patients, such a community-oriented public health approach to palliative care is refreshing, to say the least. But it is equally saddening how the work of Momotamoy Korail is an outlier, despite there being an abundance of patients across the country who require such services. Dr Nezamuddin Ahmed, former chairperson of the Palliative Medicine Department at BSMMU and adviser to the PCSB, told this newspaper how they had been struggling to fund the initiative and how it would be best to hand its responsibility over to the government. We strongly endorse this suggestion. While we commend such citizen initiatives as Momotamoy Korail, we urge the government to use them as opportunities to learn from and build on, to create a system that is more caring towards the terminally ill patients of all ages. The government must also work to remedy the poor state of elderly care in the country, including a lack of allowances, care homes, and a comprehensive pension scheme that could cover the high expenses of elderly care. The PCAs working in Korail slum have shown us how far compassion goes in improving the last stage of life for citizens who once thrived. Let us implement their example on a national level."
/opinion/editorial/news/the-public-shouldnt-pay-govt-ineptitude-3142716,The public shouldn’t pay for govt ineptitude,"We are exhausted from seeing one government project after another get delayed and their costs increase astronomically, draining more and more of the taxpayers' resources in the process. This time, it is the Dhaka-Tongi-Joydebpur railway expansion project, which is set to take 15 years to complete instead of the original three, with its cost now expected to rise fourfold from what was originally promised. It won't be easy to find another country in the world where the government is this inefficient! The Dhaka-Tongi-Joydebpur railway expansion project is a glaring example of how poor planning, bad decisions, lack of coordination, and an astounding extent of moral bankruptcy – which allows government workers to fail so miserably in their duty without a shed of remorse – among different government agencies result in a huge waste of public money. We are stunned at how this government has regularised the lack of accountability when it comes to project completion, which has normalised such delays and wastage. As has become the norm, different government agencies and project managers involved with the project have come out with a list of excuses for their failures. Among them is the fact that the Bangladesh Railway (BR) apparently took up the project without conducting any feasibility study. Why would the BR take up the project in the first place if they didn't conduct such a study, and why would it be passed? Is it because those who green-light such projects and hand out their contracts have become so corrupt that they have no regard for how the taxpayers' hard-earned money is utilised? What other explanation could there be? Another reason given for the cost escalation is the strong dollar. But the dollar has only risen in value against the taka in the past year. The project was supposed to be completed in 2015 – seven years earlier. Why should the taxpayers have to pay for the government's failure to complete it on time? Why is it that it is always the public who have to pay for the government's mistakes, incompetence or corruptness? Why aren't the authorities responsible for such mistakes, incompetence, and corruption ever held to account? Why aren't they ever made to pay?If those responsible for implementing the projects on time and within the original cost estimates are never held to account, things will never change. And if those at the top of the government are incapable of determining which projects to green-light or how to hold project managers to account, why do they still cling so hard onto their posts? We demand a change in this utterly reckless behaviour and irresponsible governance."

Shortly after Russia's assault began Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signalled he was willing to consider neutrality.Zelensky has since asked for fast-track membership, hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed partially occupied regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as Russian land on September 30.The annexation sparked international outrage. On Wednesday the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted condemning it as ""illegal"".In the past 24 hours, Russian missiles hit more than 40 settlements, while Ukrainian air force carried out 32 strikes on 25 Russian targets, reports Reuters.The southern port city of Mykolaiv came under massive bombardment.

Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office said three people were killed in the strike.Russia also targeted a settlement in the region of Ukraine's capital Kyiv, where three drone strikes hit critical infrastructure early yesterday. Governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said that based on preliminary information the strikes were caused by Iranian-made loitering munitions, often known as ""kamikaze drones"".At a face-to-face meeting in the capital of Kazakhstan yesterday, Putin proposed to his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan that Moscow could export more gas via Turkey and turn it into a new supply ""hub"", bidding to preserve Russia's energy leverage over Europe.Erdogan did not respond in the televised portion of their meeting, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the Russian news agency RIA as saying both men had ordered a rapid and detailed examination of the idea.In Ukraine's southern Kherson region, the Russian-installed governor appealed for residents to take their children and leave. The official, Vladimir Saldo, asked for Moscow's help in transporting civilians into Russia, saying the cities in the region were subject to missile attacks.Since August, Kherson has been the centre of a major Ukrainian counter-offensive in which Kyiv says it has retaken more than 1,170 sq km of land."

The state-run Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation will operate 50 buses for Ghatarchar to Kadamtoli (Route-26).The development came around 10 months after the authorities launched bus services on Ghatarchar to Kanchpur route under ""single company, single-route"" formula, with an aim to bring discipline to the city's transport system.This is a part of authorities move for rationalising the bus routes in the capital and bringing all public buses under a fixed number of companies for better regulation.To introduce the system, the authorities preliminarily decided to introduce nine cluster under different colour and bring all the buses under 22 companies and all routes under 42 routes.As per the decision, 54 existing routes would be brought under eight routes (from Route 21 to 28) under ""Green Cluster"". On December 26 last year, the new system was launched with 50 buses and yesterday buses were launched two new routes.Launching the service yesterday, Obaidul Quader, also the general secretary of ruling Awami League, said the development would not yield any fruit if discipline can not be restored. So, it is necessary to bring discipline in traffic movement in Dhaka city, he added.He said introduction of Dhaka Nagar Paribahan will help bring discipline in the traffic sector and would improve the overall living status of the city.Dhaka North City Corporation Mayor Atiqul Islam said the entire bus service in Dhaka  would be brought under bus route franchise system. As a result, traffic congestion in Dhaka will reduce, he added.No bus will be allowed to ply without a route permit, he said.

The government is to provide about $130 million of the total project cost.The project involves dredging the river for navigability, building strong embankments, townships, industries on two sides of the river, water reservoirs, and irrigation facilities.Most of the 1,11,000 hectares of irrigable land in the Teesta basin cannot be cultivated during dry season. In 2013-14, only 35 percent of the irrigable area was cultivated, according to officials concerned.Jiming visited the Teesta river in Rangpur on October 9 as he wanted to make sure if local government and people wanted the project.""Fortunately, all the messages that I got from that trip is extremely positive,"" he said, adding that he would send a message to his colleagues in Beijing that the people were eager about the project, something that would help build confidence among the Chinese officials.The Teesta water sharing deal could not be signed, though it was ready in 2011, due to opposition from Indian Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Jiming said China was actively engaged in finding ways to help Rohingya repatriation. ""We are working silently. We are doers, not talkers,"" he said.After recent border violations by Myanmar, China reached out to Myanmar in response to Bangladesh's request, he said, adding that he would officially let Bangladesh know about it."

Deforestation, human exploitation, pollution, and climate change were the biggest drivers of the loss.Wildlife populations in Latin America and the Caribbean were hit especially hard, experiencing a 94% drop in just five decades. One population of pink river dolphins in the Brazilian Amazon plummeted by 65% between 1994 and 2016, the report said.Its findings were broadly similar to those in WWF's last assessment in 2020, with wildlife population sizes continuing to decline at a rate of about 2.5% per year, Terry said.""Nature was in dire straits and it is still in dire straits,"" said Mark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK.

Pictures of beautiful models including the famous Hawa movie heroine, Nazifa Tushi have been making rounds in the social media recently, sporting beautiful jumpsuits, blazers, three-piece suits and long frocks in traditional prints, including Jamdani prints.The owner of the online fashion store, is none other than the costume designer, Aniqa Zaheen of Hawa fame, ""bluebutton.lifestyle is a pet project, established back in 2019, but then Covid happened, and the idea had to be shelved for nearly two years. Now, that things are a bit better, I have made it public once again with a new collection for summer, fall and winter,"" said the whiz designer.The main idea behind starting the fashion store was to encourage the deshi's to visit a proper 'designer-based' lifestyle store, where they could find all sorts of fashion wear and also lifestyle-related items like cushion covers, creative sofas, scented candles etc.""Bangladeshi's mostly have an inclination to go abroad for anything that is 'designer based' and that's purely a shame, especially when there are so many talented designers in our country and that is the prime idea behind starting bluebutton.lifestyle, which has also been a dream project for me, for the longest time,"" reflected Zaheen.But why the name Blue Button…?To this, Zaheen only seemed more enthusiastic to respond, ""Because it's a sea creature and I have been fond of aquatic animals since my childhood, as I was born in Cox's Bazar.The authenticity of the costume designs in 'Hawa,' certainly proves to us, how talented Zaheen is and bluebutton.lifestyle will hopefully prove to us again, that her ingenuity is boundless. "
/news/bangladesh/agriculture/news/azizar-pioneer-organic-farming-3142436,"Azizar, a pioneer in organic farming","In an interview in 2010, Ramnivas Agarwala, owner of Annapurna Organic Fertiliser Factory in Nilphamari, said, ""Soil is the mother. Soil says you give me 10kg of seeds and one maund of fertiliser. In return, I give you 50 maunds of paddy and 50 maunds of straw. Have you ever wondered where it comes from? It comes from my own body. You do one thing; you keep the paddy and give me the straw. You are my children. I wonder what will happen to you when I (soil) will die. So, keep me alive for your own sake.'' The philosophical thoughts from Ramnivas inspired me.During the time of the country's independence, our population was seven crores (70 million), and the number has gone up to over 17 crores (170 million) now.All our food is being produced from the land we had since the liberation. It hasn't increased by an inch, rather, decreased further over the years.To produce more crops from less land, we have put excessive pressure on the soil by applying chemical fertilisers. In the process, the soil loses its fertility, resulting in organic quality loss. In the meantime, although crop diversity has increased, farmers in our country are not aware of the proper use of fertiliser in different types of crops.At the open-field discussion among farmers and policymakers 'Krishi Budget, Krishoker Budget (Farmers' Voices in Budget),' I asked the farmers whether they went for a soil test. Less than one percent of farmers said they did. Most disappointingly, not even five percent of farmers were aware of soil testing. But these people needed to know that organic matter is the life of the soil.Five percent organic matter in the soil is required to maintain crop productivity. Unknowingly, they have been using excessive fertilisers and pesticides over the years. This has reduced the organic matter in the soil by one percent in most parts of the country, posing a major threat to food production for the growing populations.I took a programme, 'Grow-Green' some years back to boost farmers toward use of organic fertilisers. Also, I wanted to highlight the success of those who practice organic farming.Probably you would remember, Kaliganjpara village in Rangpur's Mithapukur upazila, which is known as an 'organic village' for decades. I showed their activities on Hridoye Mati O Manush as they were the pioneers in organic farming. Since then, the use of vermicomposting (a natural process whereby earthworms convert waste material with rigid structures of compost) started extensively.Farmer Azizar Rahman, like many others, was associated with the programme of making vermicompost on a very small scale. He used to apply the earthworm produced in his factory. Seeing good production of Azizar many farmers started using earthworms to make natural fertilisers for enhancing plant growth.Soon Azizar realised that the production of earthworms could be a good business potential. Vermicompost contains 10 of the 16 essential plant nutrients.According to research, organic matter is 28.32 percent, nitrogen 1.57 percent, phosphorus 1.26 percent, potassium 2.60 percent, calcium 2 percent, magnesium 0.66 percent, sulphur 0.74 percent, boron 0. 06 percent and iron 975, manganese 712, zinc 400 and copper 20 PPM.Vermicompost can be applied to all types of crops. Usually, three to four tonnes are used per hectare for vegetables and other agricultural products, while five to 10kg is used for each fruit plant. Farmers said with the use of vermicompost the yield has increased by 20 to 25 percent. Azizar said earthworms contributed to better soil health and fertility. Azizar now earns Tk 25,000 (USD 246.13) from his vermicompost factory every month.Azizar built a factory on three decimals of land, spending Tk 2.5 lakh (USD 2461.07), and produces five to six tonnes of organic fertiliser every month.The demand for his fertiliser is gradually increasing, not only in the surrounding areas. A small regional company regularly buys Azizar's fertiliser and sells those, using their brand name and packets.Azizar has a dream to start his own organic fertiliser product in future.   The use of organic fertilisers not only protects the soil's health, but it also reduces the need for chemical fertilisers.When chemical fertilisers are witnessing a short supply worldwide, moderate use of chemical fertilisers along with organic fertilisers can ensure good yields. It would reduce the production cost as well.Alongside the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, rooftop farming is also increasing across the country. In these cases, the use of vermicompost can play a huge role.A number of companies have now come forward in organic fertilisers and vermicompost production. Azizar's factory can be an inspiration for many unemployed youths and entrepreneurs.Besides, an employment sector can be created with a little investment that can contribute to sustainable agricultural development."
/middle-east/news/us-seeking-destabilise-iran-3142296,US seeking to destabilise Iran,"Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi yesterday accused arch-enemy the United States of seeking to destabilise the Islamic republic, which has been rocked by nearly a month of women-led protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini.Outrage over the 22-year-old woman's death, three days after she was arrested by Iran's notorious morality police, has fuelled the biggest wave of street protests and violence seen in the country for almost three years.Young women, university students and schoolgirls have been at the forefront of the protests, shouting anti-government slogans, setting their headscarves ablaze and facing off with security forces in the streets.Chants of ""Woman, Life, Freedom"", the protest movement's catchcry, were again heard overnight in the northwestern city of Bukan, where demonstrators burned the Iranian flag, in a video verified by AFP.Protesters also rallied in the capital Tehran, Isfahan in the south, Mashhad in the northeast, Rasht in the north and in Amini's western hometown of Saqez.Raisi again blamed the United States, its bitter foe since Iran's 1973 Islamic Revolution and chief adversary in a standoff over Iran's nuclear programme.""Following the failure of America in militarisation and sanctions, Washington and its allies have resorted to the failed policy of destabilisation,"" he said, speaking in Kazakhstan.Iran's judges have been issued orders against handing down soft sentences for people found to be the ""main elements of riots"", the judiciary said yesterday.Iran has charged more than 100 people over the ""riots"" in Tehran and the southern Hormozgan province alone, it said.Gunshots and tear gas were fired on Wednesday as security forces confronted protests in a crackdown that rights groups say have already claimed at least 108 lives.New online videos showed the public confronting security forces as they sought to arrest demonstrators, at times forcing officers to run away.Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights said energy industry workers had joined protest strikes this week at the Asalouyeh petrochemical plant in the southwest, Abadan in the west and Bushehr in the south.Deadly unrest has rocked especially Sanandaj in Amini's western home province of Kurdistan -- but also Zahedan in Iran's southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province, where demonstrations erupted on September 30 over the reported rape of a teenage girl by a police commander.The Human Rights Activists News Agency charged that ""the unregulated use of shotguns with pellets by law enforcement has resulted in the injury of many protesters"", including elderly people, teenagers or even children.In a report released on Wednesday, HRANA said it had the names of at least 106 people slain by the security forces, and knew of another 11 dead who remained unidentified.At least 94 more had been killed in Zahedan, one of the few Sunni-majority cities in predominantly Shia Iran, HRANA said, adding that 20 security personnel had been killed, including six in Zahedan.""The number of detainees is estimated to be at least 5,500 individuals,"" the rights group said.In its widening crackdown, Iran has restricted internet access and blocked social media platforms including Instagram and WhatsApp.The United States, which has imposed new sanctions against Iran amid the Amini protests, said it was taking steps to ensure Iranians would have online access."

/opinion/editorial/news/the-power-sector-needs-urgent-overhaul-3142586,The power sector needs an urgent overhaul ,"The power sector seems to be in a shambles at the moment. Unfortunately, when people are struggling with long hours of load shedding every day, the government and power-producing companies seem to be doing little to bring an end to the problem. The crisis has become acute this month as many of the independent power plants (IPPs) that run on heavy fuel oil have stopped producing electricity, because of a standoff with the government over non-payment of bills. Reportedly, the government owes a staggering Tk 16,000 crore to the IPPs, and the latter are unwilling to import fuel to generate electricity until their bills are cleared.The bills include the price of fuel, power purchased by the government, and capacity charge, which the government is legally obligated to pay even if it does not buy power from a plant. Reportedly, on October 12, as many as 48 power plants were sitting completely idle citing fuel shortages and engine problems – a quarter of them run on heavy fuel oil. While, according to the president of Bangladesh Independent Power Producers' Association, the unpaid bills have mostly hampered small- and medium-sized power plants – which exhausted their banking lines and can no longer open lines of credit – even big companies that can buy fuel from Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation are reportedly also sitting idle citing high import costs. Moreover, some of the companies are not operating despite having the fuel to go into production. Thus, it seems, most of the IPPs are using the power crisis to create a pressure on the government. This is totally unacceptable.From the present power crisis, it is clear that our policies regarding power generation have been flawed on many grounds. It has been identified in various news reports published over the past few months that the deals the government had signed with the power plants and companies went against our national interests. These companies have not only been taking an insane amount of money from the exchequer as capacity charges, they are also selling electricity at much higher prices. Many of the short-term rental power plants have been running for a decade now with high profit margins. As they went through multiple renewals over the years, they kept the provisions for capacity payments intact, which means huge amounts of public money are still being wasted on them.In order to recover from the present power crisis, the government must come to an understanding with the IPPs so that they do not stop their production. While the government must pay the companies their dues as soon as possible, it must also take action against the companies that are unnecessarily worsening the crisis. Finally, we need a complete overhaul of our energy policies, including a critical rethink of the provision for capacity charges, to avoid any further crisis."
/opinion/editorial/news/election-commission-shows-rare-courage-will-courage-be-enough-3142591,"EC shows rare courage, but will it be enough?","That a day would come when the Election Commission would do anything beyond perfunctory efforts to stop electoral irregularities was unthinkable even a few days ago. But the unthinkable has happened. The suspension of the Gaibandha-5 by-poll, after voting was stopped in 50 out of 145 centres amid widespread irregularities and a mass boycott by all but one candidate, is an extraordinary move, an exercise of the highest power granted to the EC. We welcome the EC for showing such courage – a rarity for bureaucrats-turned-commissioners – which is perhaps the only silver lining to an otherwise botched operation. But courage alone will not be enough to ensure fair elections, nor can it make up for the EC's – and by extension, the administration's – inability to control the Gaibandha situation.   The suspension decision has, justifiably, stunned both political parties and election observers, who noted its unprecedented nature in the recent history of parliamentary elections. But too much focus on the merits of the decision risks taking away from the fact that serious irregularities did occur, in the presence of election and law enforcement officials no less. The EC cited irregularities including illegal presence of individuals in polling booths, voters being forced to vote for a certain candidate, criminals cutting the cables of CCTV cameras, etc. The situation was ""out of control"", it said. Some candidates also alleged that their agents were forced out of the centres. An independent candidate even said that Awami League men didn't allow him to cast his own vote.So, while it's true that the EC took a drastic decision in its first brush with parliamentary elections, it is also true that it did so in the face of tremendous odds. If this is a sign of things to come, we have every reason to worry about the upcoming national election. Right now, the challenge for the EC is to get the Gaibandha-5 by-poll back on track. But it also has to investigate all reported irregularities and the potential complicity of election officials, and punish those responsible. Otherwise, all this will amount to nothing but a token concession to disgruntled opposition parties.Until Wednesday, the EC largely appeared to be appeasing the ruling party in election-related decisions. It allowed the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the upcoming national election, despite protests from most political parties. It refused to punish high-profile violators of electoral codes. It failed to send a strong message to field-level administrators – deputy commissioners (DCs) and superintendents of police (SPs) – after their grievous misconduct in a recent conference. As well as setting examples of neutrality and transparency in all its actions and preventing any collusion among election officials and the ruling party, the EC also has to figure out a way to secure unconditional support from the administration.This is a tall order indeed, and we remain unconvinced that the EC can navigate all these challenges and hold fair elections on its own. This is why the support of all stakeholders, especially the ruling party and the administration, is vital. The public has grown tired of watching violent and non-participatory elections year after year. The authorities must find a way to avoid that in the future."
/tech-startup/news/we-feel-the-need-speed-3142426,"We feel, the Need For Speed","This December, a new Need for Speed will be released for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with Criterion returning as the lead developer for the first time in almost ten years.Need for Speed Unbound, Criterion's eagerly anticipated return to the racing genre, will deliver 4K 60fps visuals in a free-roaming open world called Lakeshore using new-gen consoles and the Frostbite Engine.A$AP Rocky, the popular rapper, will have his own mode in the new instalment, and the franchise's return to its street racing roots were both incorporated into the newly revamped art style, which was first shown to fans in a trailer that was released on Thursday. The gameplay will place a strong emphasis on art and graffiti, with stylish driving rewarded with Burst Nitrous boosts.Need for Speed Unbound crosses off a lot of the items on fan wishlists from previous years. It has been in development since at least 2020. Need for Speed Unbound will heavily emphasise street racing and feature cross-play and an offline single-player mode (though not cross-progression). It will keep focusing on the cars themselves, so hood and bumper cameras are in while a cockpit view is out.Need for Speed Unbound is the first instalment since 2013 in the illustrious series, which dates back to 1994. The Guildford-based studio, best known for vintage racers like Burnout Paradise and Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, has recently provided support for games like Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront, with a focus on vehicle combat.Criterion is expanding and reworking many aspects of the gameplay while maintaining a strong focus on the elements it sees as the series' strengths after assuming control from Ghost Games.It is reflected in the single-player portion of Need for Speed Unbound, which will have an entirely new campaign structure. Additionally, it will feature what Criterion refers to as a ""immersive narrative"" in which two friends are torn apart by a robbery at a family auto shop, forcing the player to compete in the ""ultimate street race"" in order to reclaim a priceless car.The police are an essential component of every Need for Speed game, but they can be bothersome or intrusive if the player is trying to concentrate or just vibe. This is addressed in Need for Speed Unbound by allowing players to choose how much cop heat they take on, which determines how aggressive the police will be at any given moment. Additionally, Criterion is including a police scanner and a spotting mechanic, giving players more ways to avoid law enforcement if they so choose.Forza Horizon-style tiered vehicles, fully customizable characters, body kits, and wraps, as well as tie-ins with ""loads of really high-end prestige brands,"" are just a few of the ways you can customise your car in Need for Speed Unbound. Additionally, ""thousands of thousands"" of car tuning combinations and tiered vehicles akin to Forza Horizon will be available for gameplay customization.But the aspect of Need for Speed Unbound that fans will undoubtedly notice first is its highly stylized art, which differs from the appearance and feel of earlier games and the highly realistic racing genre in general. The visual style of Need for Speed Unbound will be heavily influenced by A$AP Rocky, who will also release the brand-new song ""Sh*ttin Me,"" which is featured in the trailer. A$AP Rocky will also make an appearance in-game as a leader in the Takeover Scene mode, where players band together to retake various areas of Lakeshore.Need for Speed Unbound is coming in hot, as befits a series that is all about speed. There will be less than two months between the reveal and the final release of this entry, despite the fact that it has been in development for at least three years. Fans won't have to wait too long to play the final release, even though EA and Criterion do not currently have plans for a demo or a closed beta."

We have to continue our efforts.""The premier said Bangladesh witnessed a devastating cyclone in 1991 when the then BNP government was not aware of it and that's why 1.5 lakh people were killed.Hasina, also the Awami League president, said the leaders and activists of her party stood by the cyclone-hit people and she herself visited different islands in Chattogram and helped the victims.She said Bangladesh is a disaster-prone country due to its geographical location and the country is used to facing flood, cyclone, waterlogging and salinity.Bangladesh would certainly advance towards prosperity fighting all natural and manmade disasters as the AL government was working to achieve the target, the premier added.Hasina said her government has already started working on the implementation of the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan Decade-2030 following the footsteps of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.""This plan is not only climate centric, rather it's for transforming Bangladesh into a developed and prosperous country.""In this connection, the PM said Bangladesh has formulated a 100-year-long Delta Plan-2100 aimed at protecting the country from the adverse impact of climate change.She said six hot spots have been identified across the country considering the level of disasters. Besides, National Disaster Management Plan 2021-25 has been adopted to reduce disaster risks, respond to disasters and post-disaster rehabilitation and development.The premier said her government has been working to revive canals, and water bodies across the country alongside dredging rivers to increase their capacity of holding water.Hasina briefly described her government's measures to tackle the adverse impact of climate change.""We are very aware of climate change. It will not be wise to be dependent on others over the issue and we formed a trust fund with our own financing.""The PM asked all concerned to make sure that the country's environment is not hampered.She said Bangladesh is among the countries worst affected by climate change though it has no contribution to the adverse impact of climate change.Hasina said the developed countries who contributed to the adverse impact have made promises of providing enough monetary compensations, but the pledges are mostly unfulfilled.The premier, however, said she sees hope due to the signing of the Paris Agreement.State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Md Enamur Rahman and Secretary Md Kamrul Hasan also spoke at the function.On behalf of the PM, the state minister handed over awards to 83 Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) volunteers for their contribution to disaster risk management."
/news/bangladesh/news/us-assistance-rab-ended-2018-gross-human-rights-violations-3142781,US assistance to Rab ended in 2018 for gross human rights violations,"In response to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's recent comment that it was the US that created and trained Rapid Action Battalion, the US State Department said it had ended assistance to the Rab in 2018 based on credible information of gross human rights violations.""Well, the fact is that based on credible information implicating the Rapid Action Battalion or the Rab in gross violations of human rights, we did end assistance to the Rab in 2018,"" State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said in his regular press briefing in Washington on Wednesday (October 12, 2022).He made the remarks when a journalist sought comment on the point that Bangladesh's prime minister, after returning from the UN General Assembly, said at a press conference on October 6, that the US created Rab and provided training, logistics and arms, and now they are acting as they were trained.Price stated that the US stopped assisting Rab four years ago and sanctioned Rab and its six current and former officers under Global Magnitsky Sanctions in December last year in connection with Rab's participation in serious and gross human rights violations.""And we publicly designated two former Rab officials under a separate authority, 7031(c), for their involvement in gross violations of human rights,"" he said.Price also said whether it is in Bangladesh or anywhere else in South Asia or around the world, the US has placed human rights at the centre of its foreign policy.""And we are committed likewise to drawing attention to and putting a spotlight on those who are responsible for human rights violations when they occur,"" he said.He also said these sanctions and visa restrictions aim to promote accountability and reform for the Rab and to deter human rights abuse globally. ""And just as we hold these actors accountable, we'll continue to partner with countries to develop their own capacity to fight crime, to administer justice, and to safeguard the rule of law. Our training to Bangladesh security forces promotes these very principles.""Bangladesh has been trying in different ways to make sure that the sanctions imposed on Rab are withdrawn.US Ambassador to Bangladesh Peter Haas maintained that they will not withdraw sanctions until accountability is ensured and reforms made to Rab."
/entertainment/tv-film/news/the-death-cartoon-network-3142696,The death of Cartoon Network? ,"Warner Bros' CEO, David Zaslav has been on a crusade to change what many of us loved about the company. From making Warner Bros Discovery less-diverse overall—by cutting a large number of employees—his latest plans to restructure the company seems likely to kill a channel most of us have grown up with, Cartoon Network. Even if Cartoon Network is not completely killed off, it is likely to become a shadow of what it originally used to be.These recent cuts, which come in the wake of Warner's merger with Discovery, eliminated a total of 43 open positions from its television division. In August, Warner Bros Discovery also cut around 70 positions at HBO Max, which also killed off the completed ""Batgirl"" movie and also resulted in dozens of other shows and movies being shelved.Now, people are concerned about the implications of the company's latest plans to merge Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios.According to an internal memo from Warner Bros Television CEO, Channing Dungey, Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe, Warner Bros Animation, and Cartoon Network Studios would continue to exist, under a 'new streamlined structure'.However, Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios will now have to share their development and production team. This decision probably  But the latter two animation labels will now share ""development and main production teams,"" which essentially means that Cartoon Network Studios will no longer have the creative control, as well as the choice to make decisions regarding operational matters.Zaslav's crusade to cut costs by cancelling the ""Batgirl"" movie—which has already completed filming—and shows like ""Raised by Wolves"", is seemingly continuing with the current situation surrounding Warner Bros Animation and Cartoon Network Studios.However, as these two studios will now be working under one shared budget and a singular team, it seems unlikely that they will be able to operate in the same capacity they had previously. If this was not obvious already, earlier this month, Cartoon Network's ""Craig of the Creek"" and ""Jessica's Big Little World"" had their episode orders cut back by 50 percent. While both shows have not been cancelled as of yet, the way their budgets have been cut—despite the fact that they are some of Cartoon Network's most successful franchises—feels like a tell-tale situation for things to come. It seems likely that Warner Bros Discovery will keep the brand of Cartoon Network alive, simply due to the level of fanfare surrounding it. However, it feels like going forward, the Cartoon Network we all loved and grew up with will just be a shell of its former shelf. "
/tech-startup/news/new-pixel-phones-and-more-everything-google-announced-the-pixel-7-event-3142391,New pixel phones and more: everything Google announced in the Pixel 7 event,"Google recently concluded its major fall event, during which it unveiled the Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, and Pixel Watch. Google provided additional information about its upcoming Pixel Tablet, which will be available in 2023. Overall, there weren't many surprises this year because Google already revealed its own hardware at Google I/O, but it was great to see these products up close and learn the exact costs, release dates, and other information.There were two Pixel 7 announcements. With the switch to the Tensor G2 processor, a refined palette of colours, up to three days of battery life in Extreme Battery Saver mode, and an improved 10.8-megapixel selfie camera, they have made a few notable improvements. Google is promoting some Pixel 7-only features, including 4K / 60 frames per second video on each lens and Cinematic Blur, one of its cutting-edge camera features that adds depth of field to your videos, even though the camera hardware is similar to the last-generation model.The 48-megapixel telephoto camera has a slightly improved Super Res Zoom (from 20x to 30x) and an additional step of optical zoom, moving from 4x in the Pixel 6 Pro to 5x in the more recent device. The ultrawide camera has also had its field of view expanded. Google is promoting 4K / 60fps in all of its new cameras, just like the Pixel 7.The case size for Pixel Watch is 41mm. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, and NFC for Google Wallet contactless payments are all supported by the standard model. It is compatible with GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, and Galileo satellites in terms of GPS support. The Gorilla Glass 5 glass dome protecting the Pixel Watch's top features an OLED display that, according to Google, can have a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits. A display that is always on is also supported.The Exynos 9110 system on a chip from Samsung and the Cortex M33 coprocessor are both found in this smartwatch. It boasts 32GB of eMMC flash storage and 2GB of SDRAM and runs Wear OS 3.5. So, whether the Pixel Watch feels faster than other Wear OS watches is still up in the air. I must admit that while the specs don't seem particularly impressive, the design is quite different. I'm going to find it difficult to wait since I'm a sucker for how it looks.Deep Fitbit integration is also available on the Pixel Watch, including the ability to track your heart rate once every second.Google collaborated with Molly Burke, a blind social media influencer and motivational speaker, to demonstrate Guided Frame, an accessibility feature that enables the Pixel 7 to voice feedback while in selfie mode. It automatically brings the user into focus and helps them choose the best vantage point. It will vocally state that it is prepared for the selfie before starting an audible countdown.The manufacturer acknowledged that this feature needs a Tensor G2 processor, so Pixel 6 owners will be unable to use it unless Google finds a way to make it compatible with older chipsets.At Google I/O, the business first hinted that a Pixel Tablet might exist, and now, several months later, it has provided a wealth of additional information. It will be offered in two hues, an off-white and an olive green. A charging speaker dock is available that transforms the device into a modern Google Nest Hub. Pogo pins on the tablet's back allow it to magnetically connect to the dock.The Tensor G2 processor found in the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro will also be found in the Pixel Tablet. The manufacturer claims that this device can be used for video calling, photo editing, or even just calling out to Google Assistant from across the room."

It was at least the 41st ballistic missile launch by North Korea this year.The South Korean JCS statement said the aircraft incident happened late on Thursday and early Friday Korean time.The statement said the North Korean aircraft were detected flying about 25 km (15 miles) north of the Military Demarcation Line in the central region of the Korea border area and about 12 km (7 miles) north of the Northern Limit Line, a de facto inter-Korean border in the Yellow Sea, between 10:30 p.m. Thursday (1330 GMT) and 0:20 a.m. on Friday (1530 GMT Thursday).The JCS said the aircraft were also seen near the eastern part of the inter-Korean border.It said the South Korean air force ""conducted an emergency sortie with its superior air force, including the F-35A, and maintained a response posture, while carrying out a proportional response maneuver corresponding to the flight of a North Korean military aircraft.""KCNA quoted a spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army (KPA) as saying that the South Korean army had conducted about 10 hours of artillery fire near North Korea's forward defense on Thursday.""Taking a serious note of this provocative action by the South Korean military in the frontline area, we took strong military countermeasures,"" it said.""The KPA sends a stern warning to the South Korean military inciting military tension in the frontline area with reckless action,"" it added.A spokesman for South Korea's military said he had no information regarding the South Korean artillery fire reported by the North.North Korea has said that its most recent series of missile tests, which included an intermediate range ballistic missile that flew over Japan last week, was a show of force against joint South Korean and U.S. military drills.South Korea scrambled fighter jets a week ago after North Korean warplanes staged an apparent bombing drill as allied warships held missile defense drills in response to North Korean missile tests."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/dui-diner-duniya-masterful-mix-logic-and-supernatural-mystique-3142776,‘Dui Diner Duniya’: A masterful mix of logic and supernatural mystique,"When an enigmatic figure—who claims to be from the future—crosses paths with a regular truck driver, where does the story go? Well, this is the plot of Chorki's newest release, ""Dui Diner Duniya"".Starring the stellar duo of Chanchal Chowdhury and Fazlur Rahman Babu, the mystery-thriller is where the past, the present, and the future collide, all at once, to show how life's simplest philosophy of retribution has the strangest ways of manifesting itself.One night, while trucking through the highway, Samad (Chanchal Chowdhury) spots a lone old man—later introduced as Jamshed (Fazlur Rahman Babu)—who is following him everywhere. Upon accepting Samad's offer for a free ride, Jamshed confesses that he has come here from the year 2033.He goes on to say that he is here to help Samad survive grave danger, which will inevitably take place soon. To Samad, all of this sounds like the tale of a madman, or the conspiracy of a fool. Samad continues to believe this narrative until a string of unfortunate events, caused in the wake of Samad's past misdeeds, start to surface. This is when we see Jamshed's life and true identity begin to gradually unravel themselves.Anam Biswas's direction and Ashraful Alam Shaon's storytelling was a highly anticipated collaboration, yet I was not ready for the sheer magnitude of their masterful layering of earthly logic and supernatural mystique.Although, by the end of the story, the core message becomes quite clear, the brilliance lies in the multifaceted possibilities of interpreting everything leading up to it.From the birds' eye shots of Samad's truck navigating the long stretch of the highway, eerily reminiscent of life's stubborn continuity despite the burdens of the past; to the role of Jamshed himself in the crescendo, seemingly a personification of one's own karma, it felt as if I might miss a subtle metaphor every time I dared to blink.The climax, in particular, hit home because of the clever do-or-die implications, a fine illustration of kismet's merciless revenge. Immediately followed by yet another mind-boggling turn, the ending manages to leave a trail of questions despite providing closure, leaving us with somewhat of a pleasant dilemma.When one takes attention away from the small details and looks at the bigger picture, it's astounding how ""Dui Diner Duniya"" utilises its female side-characters, as all of them— despite minimal screentime—play a massive part in the outline of the core plot.It might not seem noticeable at first, but Samad—whose vilest deeds include a woman as one of his victims—finds his daughter in the crux of his ultimate destiny, the key to which also lies in the hand of another woman, equal retribution once again. My personal favourite female character in this case was Moushumi Hamid as Lata, who doesn't get to say much, and yet leaves a mark.Chanchal Chowdhury and Fazlur Rahman Babu fit into their roles as neatly as puzzle pieces falling in place, maintaining perfectly convincing character, while delivering performances without overshadowing one another throughout the entire duration. As a whole, ""Dui Diner Duniya"" is a story viewers might need some time to process, but it will be one that stays with you."
/tech-startup/news/xiaomi-12s-ultra-kicking-it-notch-3142381,Xiaomi 12S Ultra: Kicking it up a notch,"Xiaomi has been playing the safe game in Bangladesh for a while now. Churning out generic yet market-tested devices is in its local DNA. We understand that and it does not mean it is a bad thing. In fact, quite the contrary- it has been able to secure the top seat in the market in the last quarter by following the safest playbook. But at its root, Xiaomi is an innovator and pusher of boundaries. The Xiaomi 12S Ultra, which we had the opportunity to fiddle with for a month or so, is a very good example of that. Unfortunately, despite having killer specs and top-notch hardware, we could only utilise its camera as it came with Chinese ROM. Even the keyboard was hard to use as it came with only generic Chinese keyboards. As the camera is the central aspect of the phone let's keep our focus locked on the camera for this review: Firstly, the main camera system is massive and top-heavy. The Leica-designed camera module is the mainstay here. Supplementing it is a Sony IMX989 processor for the 50 megapixels module. IMX989 is renowned for delivering top-notch photos that are crisp and full of colours. The main camera, as a whole as a unit, delivers outstanding photos. The vibrance and details are better than another top-tier Samsung smartphone we are reviewing right now. It performs splendidly well in a low-light environment. Due to the 1-inch sensor, we can get a hint of a bokehish effect in some of the images. The 5x periscopic optical zoom does an average job of bringing the far objects closer. The ultra-wide-angle camera also does not stand out, unfortunately. The images visibly lacked the colour contrast and sharpness that is a must in many high-end smartphones these days. Before wrapping up, a few things we noticed about the phone: the fingerprint processor is blazingly fast and the vegan leather fill on the back does not do a good job replacing ceramic backs that we have seen on the high-end smartphones of Xiaomi. The phone also comes with an extremely crisp display with a 10-bit colour gamut with a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The brightness of the display is also as good as many other flagships you will encounter in the market.Verdict: Xiaomi outdid itself. For that, we certainly recommend patting itself on the back. The phone's extraordinary camera can certainly put the top dogs of Samsung and Apple on a chase. Unfortunately, the Chinese ROM hindered us from trying out the rest of the functions of the phone. The phone's price is close to BDT 1 Lac on the grey market. Xiaomi is officially not selling it in Bangladesh so that's a bummer."

/business/economy/news/cargo-complex-airport-boost-export-sylhet-3142441,Cargo complex at airport to boost export from Sylhet ,"The history of people from Bangladesh's Sylhet division living in European countries, especially the United Kingdom, goes back around 350 years and the diaspora there has kept growing over the centuries.But despite living abroad for so long, the Sylheti people have never let their cultural heritage fade away. As a result, the demand for food and other products from the region, such as different types of citrus and rattan furniture, is rising in the countries they reside in.These goods are mostly exported through the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka as the required facilities at the Osmani International Airport in Sylhet were not put in place.But as an export cargo complex has finally been set up at the airport, the days of wait, extra efforts and expenses, and the drop in the quality of goods are over.The facility was constructed between February 2020 and August 2021 by the airport authority in association with Biman Bangladesh Airlines at a cost of around Tk 30 crore.Later, Tk 14 crore was spent on installing explosive detection scanners in the facility, which was validated by the European Union in April this year.Currently, no cargo flights are operated from Sylhet although each Biman flight is capable of carrying 12 tonnes to 18 tonnes of goods, according to Md Hafiz Ahmed, director of the Osmani International Airport.Even though the export cargo complex is all set to facilitate shipments, one hurdle remains in sending perishable items abroad: agricultural produce needs to be packed in a warehouse of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) and must be certified after testing at a laboratory operated by the same authority.However, such a facility is only available at Shyampur in Dhaka. As such, Sylhet-based businesses have long been urging the authorities to establish the facility in the region.Md Hizkil Gulzar, an exporter and a director of the Sylhet Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), said local businesses suffer a lot in exporting goods via Dhaka due to a lack of warehouses and a certification lab nearby.""If such facilities were in Sylhet, the export would receive a boost since many new traders would open businesses.""The SCCI has sent several letters to the agriculture, commerce and foreign ministries to press home its demand since January last year. It also organised a seminar in this regard on February 15, where Agriculture Minister Mohammad Abdur Razzaque was present.At the event, the minister assured the association of taking the necessary steps to establish such facilities in the northeastern divisional city.On September 6, the SCCI handed over a letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina mentioning 17 demands, including that for a warehouse and a certification laboratory.Md Mustafizur Rahman, president of the Jalalabad Vegetable and Frozen Fish Export Group, said the demand for citron and other citrus fruits, naga chilli, sour fruits, beans and many vegetables is rising abroad but exporters in Sylhet do not want to go to Dhaka to process shipments.Currently, there are 15 exporters in Sylhet.""Once the warehouse and the certification laboratory are established, more people will be interested in exporting,"" he added.At present, the DAE has no plan to establish a warehouse and certification lab in the city.""But we realise the need for such facilities at the Sylhet airport as it will help export fresh perishable produce from the region,"" said Sayed Rafiqul Amin, director of the DAE's plant quarantine wing.Amin went on to say that as the need for such facilities is huge, the DAE could extend various support, including human resources, for private initiatives to establish the required facilities.Tahmin Ahmed, president of the SCCI, said the chamber has been urging the authorities to set up the warehouse and certification facilities for years but to no avail.""We have recently informed the prime minister of our demands and we are hopeful that the premier will take necessary initiatives soon."" "

/tech-startup/news/wegro-technologies-breath-fresh-air-farmers-and-investors-3142406,WeGro Technologies: A breath of fresh air for farmers and investors,"With a population of over 170 million, Bangladesh relies heavily on the agricultural sector to meet its rising food demands. However, smallholder farmers, who are an integral part of the agricultural sector face numerous obstacles in the country. With access to proper financing and quality agricultural inputs hard to come by, the farmers struggle to make ends meet. This is where WeGro Technologies Limited comes into play.WeGro is an agri-tech-based startup that links farmers and investors. Users can invest in agricultural initiatives like raising livestock or growing vegetables through its app. WeGro enables small farmers to receive funding by connecting them with investors and advising them about the best practices. Moreover, farmers can also get access to quality agricultural inputs and market opportunities during the project's duration.WeGro was founded in April 2021 by Md Mahmudur Rahman and Md. Alvi Rahman, after the two founders, raised project investments from their network of friends and peers to invest in their first farm project. Now in 2022, WeGro is seeking to raise $1.2 Million in seed funding to expand their efforts across the entire country to impact the lives of 200,000 farmers by 2024.WeGro, at its core, views agriculture as a space for investment instead of debt lending. It focuses on farmers' profitability. The agri-tech startup explores all opportunities to generate maximum profit for the farmer within the scope of the projects. This means providing guidance, vaccination, agri-input, insurance, etc. during the project tenure as well as storage, transport, and access to the market and other facilities after the output is produced. WeGro regularly collaborates and researches to find ways to impact the entire agricultural value chain through its proactive efforts.In its first year of operations, WeGro's annual revenue was over BDT 3.5 Crores ($356,471).WeGro has a dedicated app for its investors. All the available projects can be accessed through the app. Currently, it has 4 projects available for its investors. The minimum investment amount for the projects is BDT 25,000. The projects are sold as units and investors can purchase as many units as they want, subject to the availability of the units. Upon investing, the stages of the project are also visible on the app.WeGro is Shariah compliant, with profits distributed between the farmer, investor and WeGro at a 45-45-10 ratio. It distributes the profits as soon as the outputs are sold. When a project is booked, the funds from the investor are collected through bank transactions. After maturation, the fund, along with the profits gained from the project, is reimbursed to the investors' bank account.WeGro is currently working with over 1,000 farmers across 10 zones in the country, including Rangpur, Mymensingh, Kishoreganj, Sirajganj, Pabna, Natore, Keraniganj, etc.The WeGro app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store and Apple Store."

/business/economy/news/forex-reserves-under-further-strain-bb-sells-dollar-3142486,Forex reserves under further strain as BB sells dollar,"The injection of the US dollar into the market by Bangladesh Bank has surpassed $4 billion so far in the current fiscal year, creating further pressure on the country's foreign exchange reserves that are now depleting fast.Bangladesh Bank supplied dollars to the market to the tune of $4.15 billion between July 1 and October 13 in order to help lenders clear import bills.The central bank injected a record $7.62 billion in the last fiscal year with a view to keeping the exchange rate stable.High import payments are the main reason for the depletion of forex reserves, which stood at $36.3 billion as of October 12 in contrast to $36.5 billion on September 29 earlier this year.The reserves amounted to $46.2 billion in September last year, data from Bangladesh Bank shows.""The fact that dollars are being sold by Bangladesh Bank means that demand for the greenback is still higher than the supply,"" said Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh.The value of taka already saw a sharp decline after the central bank had allowed banks to set the exchange rate of the local currency against the US dollar, he added.The exchange rate of the taka stood at Tk 105.66 per dollar on October 12, down 23.43 per cent from a year ago.The depreciation of the local currency has already reduced the opening of letters of credit (LCs), which will have a positive impact in curbing the depletion of foreign exchange reserves.However, the settlement of LCs has yet to see any positive output from the depreciation as those which are being settled now were opened three to four months earlier.The number of LCs opened amounted to $12.4 billion in the first two months of the ongoing fiscal year in contrast to $12.3 billion in fiscal 2021-22. However, the settlement of LCs has increased to $15.3 billion, up 42.3 per cent from a year earlier.Mansur says that remittance and export earnings did not give any positive sign in September, creating a worry for the macroeconomy.He suggested the central bank follow the three indicators – export, import and remittance – each day in order to keep the reserves stable.""If remittance and export earnings decrease further, the central bank should give efforts to squeeze imports payments more,"" he said.Mansur also recommended the government manage budgetary and balance of payment support from the International Monetary Fund in the quickest possible time so as to defuse the ongoing volatility.Mansur, also a former IMF official, prescribed the central bank follow a uniform exchange rate instead of the existing multiple fixed rates between the taka and US dollar in order to restore discipline in the foreign exchange market.Monzur Hossain, research director of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, said the existing amount of reserves is good but its speedy depletion is creating trouble for the economy.The central bank is now supplying dollar to banks, mostly state-run lenders, at a lower rate than its current market price so that state-run corporations such as the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation can import essential commodities at a cheap rate.As such, the central bank is now injecting each greenback quoting Tk 97 from banks that open LCs for state-run corporation.Hossain reckons that Bangladesh Bank should follow the market rate while injecting dollars into banks as the facilities enjoyed by the government should be same for the private sector as well.Banks now pay a maximum of Tk 107.5 to buy dollars coming in through foreign exchange houses in the form of remittance while they pay up to Tk 99 to purchase dollars from exporters.Importers are now buying the greenback based on the weighted average exchange rate, meaning the average of the rates at which banks purchase dollars from exporters and remittance from foreign exchange houses, plus Tk 1.Hossain says the central bank should stop intervening in the market by following a uniform exchange rate, which the country had been following for years."
/news/bangladesh/transport/news/dhaka-joydebpur-rail-expansion-3yr-project-now-take-15-cost-four-times-more-3142206,Dhaka-Joydebpur rail expansion: 3yr project now to take 15; cost rises fourfold,"The Dhaka-Tongi-Joydebpur railway expansion project is a glaring example of how poor planning, bad decisions and lack of coordination among different government agencies result in huge waste of public money.If the latest revision of cost and deadline is approved, the project that was supposed to be completed in three years will now take 15 and cost Tk 3,265.76 crore, almost four times the original estimate.Bangladesh Railway (BR) undertook the project in November 2012 to improve the capacity of a vital section that connects the capital with most of the country's rail network.It was undertaken without any feasibility study and detailed design, BR officials said.The Tk 848.60 crore project, aimed at constructing a third and fourth dual-gauge railway lines on the Dhaka-Tongi route and a second dual-gauge line on the Tongi-Joydebpur route, was supposed to be completed within June 2015.But physical works could start only in February 2019, mainly due to complexities over design and tendering process. The deadline was extended until 2023 in phases.But, the project, which is implemented with Indian Lines of Credit, has seen just 58.25 percent progress and project authorities recently sought time until June 2027 and Tk 2,158.96 crore more.Construction of the Dhaka Elevated Expressway over the rail line in the capital is the main reason project authorities sought the extension last month, current Project Director Nazneen Ara Keya told The Daily Star yesterday.Physical work of the railway project from the capital's Khilgaon to Kamalapur has not started because of expressway construction, she said.Complexities over land acquisition, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the long delay in starting physical work are other major reasons, the project director said.Increase of work, redesign of the Turag Bridge, increase in land acquisition costs, and the strong dollar are the major reasons behind the cost escalation, she added.Dhaka is connected with the entire country's rail network, except Narayanganj, through the Dhaka-Tongi section. This is also part of the Trans-Asian Railway network.The 22.39km section has a dual-gauge double line with a capacity to operate 112 trains daily, but 120 trains run through the section route currently.The 11.09km Tongi-Joydebpur section, which links the capital with the north-western region, has dual-gauge single line with a capacity to operate 44 trains daily but 58 trains are being operated now.REASONS BEHIND DELAY
Even before physical work started, the project had to be revised in October 2014. It was supposed to be implemented on a design-build basis, meaning both the design and construction services would be provided by the same contractor.
But as design-build would cost more, the project authorities decided to do a detailed design first, leading them to revise the project for the first time, project documents show.
Thus, the project cost rose to Tk 1,106.80 crore and deadline extended to December 2016. Then, consultants prepared a detailed design.
BR in July 2018 signed a contract with two Indian companies for the main civil-engineering work of the project at a cost of Tk 1,393.78crore, which is Tk 287.78 crore more than the total project cost after the first revision in 2014.
In the meantime, Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority has asked to increase the vertical clearance of the Turag Bridge, which is part of the railway expansion project, forcing project authorities to redesign it.
Due to changes in the design, the construction cost of the bridge increased by Tk 96.30 crore which is 8.70 percent of the project cost after the first revision.
Then, Covid-19 pandemic hit the country in early 2020, hampering project progress severely due to lockdown and disruption in supply of construction materials.
The project deadline was then extended to June 2023.
However, construction of Dhaka Elevated Expressway from the airport on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway to Kutubkhali on the Dhaka-Chattogram highway appeared as the main obstacle.
The expressway, being implemented under a public-private partnership model, is being constructed over the rail track from Kawla to Kamalapur in Dhaka.
Around 75 percent of rail line expansion area in that section was occupied by expressway works until September this year, and as a result, rail expansion was halted.
If the rail authorities carry out their work, expressway authorities cannot do theirs.
Expressway authorities said they would hand over the track up to FDC gate by June 2023 in phases and it is expected that work up to Kamalapur would be completed within June 2024, according to the documents of the railway expansion project.
Rail project authorities said that in such a situation, they would require time until June 2027, including a one-year defect liability period.
Besides, at least three cases are ongoing over the land needed to implement the railway expansion project, which is another major reason behind the delay.
Rail authorities sought 13.44 acres from Bangladesh Civil Aviation Authority and 0.5 acres from Dhaka Cantonment, shows project documents.
COST ESCALATION
In their proposal submitted to BR last month, project authorities cited several reasons behind the cost escalation.
In the detailed design of the project, the cost of bridge construction work increased by Tk 214.44 crore.
Besides, some other changes were made in the plan, resulting in an increase of Tk 706.11 crore for the track laying work.
Cost for signalling work has increased by Tk 290.36 crore while land acquisition cost has been estimated at Tk 500 crore.
Project Director Nazneen Ara Keya, however, said project cost would reduce slightly if they get the land from Caab for free as a government agency.
The Daily Star tried to contact Dhirendra Nath Mazumder, BR director general, for comment but he did not answer his phone.

/opinion/views/blowin-the-wind/news/university-ranking-announcement-and-the-morning-after-3142761,University ranking announcement and the morning after,"The oldest private university in Bangladesh is giving its oldest public university a run for its money. They are the only two educational institutions to be featured in the top 800 of a world ranking estimated by Times Higher Education (THE). To see these local universities in the same global category provokes more questions than answers. These two universities – one in Dhaka North, the other in Dhaka South – are separated by thick traffic worth two-three hours on the road and a culture of mutual dismissiveness. Whether the ranking agency will thaw the frozen relationship is a matter to be seen. The achievement of North South University (NSU) cannot be brushed aside as it devised and pursued a strategic plan to achieve its status in the elite club of universities. Three other Bangladeshi universities, all technical in orientation – Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), and Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (Kuet) – have been featured in the 1200-1500 range. The overall performance is dismal. It begs the question: why are the other leading public universities and notable private universities not there?Established in 1921, Dhaka University (DU) has a clear advantage in the five areas in which THE measures the performance of a university: teaching, research, citations, international outlook, and industry income. With its government funding, DU caters to 38,172 students and has a fleet of 2,200 teachers. Conversely, NSU, established in 1992, has 20,596 students with a teaching team of 386 full-time and 362 part-time teachers. As per the UGC's 2019 record, DU spent Tk 52.02 crore in research and had 472 publications, while NSU spent Tk 65.32 crore in research and claimed 1,135 publications.It needs to be mentioned that a university needs to have 300 indexed publications a year for five consecutive years to be considered for THE ranking. NSU has persistently nurtured a research culture to be at par with a university that is 70 years older than it. The presence of three technical universities in the ranking suggests that they have the required number of publications, which many other universities lack.It is refreshing to see that DU is feeling the pressure to excel. Recently, it initiated an annual performance goal for each academic department and liberalised its international outlook. According to THE, 7.5 percent marks are given for international outlook based on the proportion of international students, international staff and international collaboration. This is an area in which private universities have greater flexibility. In terms of teaching, which makes up for 30 percent of the ranking scale, the subcategories are reputation survey, staff-to-student ratio, doctorate to bachelors ratio, doctorate awarded to academic staff, and institutional income.Given the government's policy of not allowing private universities to award doctorate degrees, private universities are missing out on the learning environment category. The same goes for industry income, amounting to 2.5 percent of THE ranking metrics, in which private universities are handicapped as they are not allowed to run for-profit institutes. But a lot depends on the reputation survey (15 percent in teaching and 18 percent in research), where the alumni in the job market contribute to the overall image of the participating university.NSU's success will inspire some other private universities to join the world ranking. They already have a clear strategic vision in place. The share of student distribution in the tertiary system, if we exclude the colleges under the National University, is almost equal. However, there persist some misconceptions about private universities as they are subjected to some additional regulatory monitoring that handicaps their growth.The introduction of private universities has stopped many students from going abroad as they could get quality education within the country and save money because of the credit-transfer scheme. In many cases, the curricula of public universities are not updated. Most of our programmes are not accredited. The government has initiated the Bangladesh Accreditation Council, which is likely to address the issue and bring the public and private universities under the same measurement scale. For the tertiary sector to grow, there has to be a common and consistent policy. Some older universities behave as if they are above any scrutiny. Their claim to vaunted prestige is now being rightfully challenged and claimed by newer universities. It is about time these divisions were eschewed as the teachers who teach and the students who learn are all citizens of this country. They all deserve fair and equal treatment. For instance, UGC research and travel grants are given only to public university teachers. UGC allows PhD programmes to be offered only by public universities.With the kind of intellectual resources that the leading private universities have, either through reverse brain drain by accommodating returning expatriate scholars or through retaining the best teachers who have retired from the public system, they can easily attract both local and international students in PhD programmes. Of course, UGC can apply strict regulatory criteria for awarding the degree. In absence of such open-mindedness, we are seeing many of our local students going abroad. Malaysia has become the second largest student destination for Bangladeshi students, which used to be a source country in the 1980s. According to the Bangladesh Bank, in the first four months of this year, USD 343.9 million were sent abroad to Bangladeshi students. Through the official channel, USD 1.32 billion (Tk 12,144 crore) was sent abroad for outbound student mobility. The actual figures would be higher as there is no record of the illegal channels. The number of outbound students has increased by 129 percent in the last six years. The success of DU and NSU shows that with the right attitude, we can create world-class universities to cater to our local needs and retain foreign currencies from being siphoned out. But to benefit from the system, we need a radical change in the mindset of the policymakers and the government. Dr Shamsad Mortuza is a professor of English at Dhaka University."
/business/economy/news/countrys-first-commercial-crocodile-farm-eyes-revival-3142491,Country’s first commercial crocodile farm eyes revival,"The country's first commercial crocodile venture, The Reptiles Farm Ltd, is now making efforts to bounce back from the pandemic-induced business slowdown, riding on the exports of crocodiles and skins. The farm, located at Hatibeer of Mymensingh's Bhaluka upazila, suffered serious losses as many crocodiles died owing to food shortage and the export of the skins of the animals came to a complete halt because of the pandemic in the last two years.Now the farm management has embarked on fulfilling its pending export orders for 2,000 skins this year and is hopeful of shipping 500 skins early next year.""The pandemic was a nightmare for people around the world and businesses. We are a victim of the crisis as well,"" said farm manager Abu Sayem Muhammad Arif.Mushtaq Ahmed, a late writer, and Mesbahul Hoque, an entrepreneur, started working on crocodile farming in 2002. The two entrepreneurs jointly launched it investing Tk 5 crore with 49 per cent financial support coming from the Equity and Entrepreneur Fund of the government in the form of an interest-free loan.Established on 15 acres of land, the farm received approval from the forest and environment ministry in 2004.The entrepreneurs first imported 75 salt-water crocodiles aged 15 to 28 years from Malaysia in the same year at a cost of Tk 1.25 crore. During the shipment, one crocodile died while six more passed after reaching the farm.The farm was sold to PK Halder in 2012. But when Halder's involvement in financial corruption surfaced in 2020, his ownership was cancelled.Following a petition by International Leasing & Financial Service Ltd, a nonbank financial institution, from where Halder took Tk 100 crore in loans, the High Court formed a six-member committee headed by an international repute crocodile expert Enam Hoque as its managing director in March this year to run the farm.Enam said: ""We took the charge to support the survival of the country's first new business initiative. This is also a national asset.""When he assumed the responsibility, there were 1,700 crocodiles alive and many of them were injured and sick. So, the new management had to provide them treatment and serve proper diet to restore their health.The farm is now home to more than 2,500 crocodiles. Of them, 93 are at the breeding stage and 500 are ready to shed skins that could be processed and exported. The production and skin processing are done at the farm.""The number of crocodile babies will increase gradually,"" said Enam, who has a crocodile farming and processing business in Australia.Reptiles Farm has a target to raise the animal stock to 20,000 crocodiles in the next five years. it has a capacity to accommodate around 40,000 crocodiles.NEW EXPORT ITEMCrocodile skin has emerged as a potential export item for Bangladesh due to its high demand in some Asian and European countries.Reptiles Farm has been exporting crocodile skins to Japan for the last five years. It made its maiden export to the East Asian country in 2014 when it shipped 430 crocodile skins for around $200,000, said farm sources.It shipped 1,507 skins between 2014 and 2019.Now skins are exported only to Japan. But farm officials say there are huge opportunities to export skins and other items to Japan and other European and Asian countries.More than two million crocodile skins are traded annually around the world, according to a 2017 United Nations Environment Programme report.There are commercial crocodile farms in 40 countries, including China, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam.Reptiles Farm plans to export 1,000 skins annually. A piece of skin can bring $600 to $700.Other by-products like skulls, nails, bones and scrap leathers are left to waste as there is no scope to sell them in the local markets or export the items since their volume is small, said Md Rafiqul Alam, a professor of the veterinary science faculty at the Bangladesh Agricultural University.If the by-products could be sold at home and abroad, $1,500 to $2,000 more could be earned from each crocodile.""This will support the farm financially,"" said Alam, also a director of the board of Reptiles Farm.Crocodile meat is widely consumed in Australia, Japan, Singapore, China and the Americas. One kilogramme of meat is sold between $30 and $35 in international markets.The meat is dumped since the export of the item from Bangladesh is not allowed. If meat is sold to foreigners in the country's posh hotels, the farm will be able to sell five to six tonnes of meat per year, according to Alam.Crocodile leather is used for making luxury handbags, wallets, belts and boots and other items, said farm manager Arif.Crocodile teeth, scrap hide and other by-products could be used to make fashionable commodities, garlands, ornaments, ornament boxes, wallets, showpieces and purses. Charcoal made from crocodile bones is used in manufacturing perfumes throughout the world.The estimated cost of rearing a crocodile until its maturity is $250. A crocodile reaches maturity for skins in three years and it takes eight to 10 years to reach the breeding stage.Chicken, minced beef, and small fish are given to crocodiles, aged one to three years, as food. For those aged three and above, the same items are given to them but once a week as it takes time for the grown-ups to digest food, said farm officials.Around 7,000 saplings, including those of fruits and medicinal trees, have been planted in the farm this year, raising the number of total trees to 15,000 with a view to creating a congenial environment for the animals.The new management has taken an initiative to turn Reptiles Farm into an attractive tourism destination. So, a resort could be opened next month, an addition that would contribute to making the farm financially strong.""Both farming and tourism will also create jobs and business opportunities for hundreds of people in the locality,"" added Enam."

/news/world/uk/news/uk-pm-truss-fires-kwasi-kwarteng-says-bbc-3142741,"UK PM Truss fires Kwasi Kwarteng, says BBC","British Prime Minister Liz Truss has fired her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, the BBC reported on Friday, shortly before she is expected to scrap parts of his economic package in a bid to survive the market and political turmoil gripping the country.Downing Street confirmed that Truss, in power for only 37 days, would hold a press conference later on Friday after Kwarteng was forced to rush back to London from IMF meetings in Washington to address the chaos.The BBC said Kwarteng had been sacked. Downing Street declined to comment.If that is confirmed, Kwarteng would become Britain's shortest serving chancellor since 1970, and his successor would be the country's fourth finance minister in as many months.British government bonds rallied further on Friday, adding to their partial recovery since Truss's government started looking for ways to balance the books after her unfunded tax cuts crushed UK asset values and drew international censure.Kwarteng had announced a new fiscal policy on Sept. 23, delivering Truss's vision for vast tax cuts and deregulation to try to shock the economy out of years of stagnant growth.But the response from markets was so ferocious that the Bank of England had to intervene to prevent pension funds from being caught up in the chaos, as borrowing and mortgage costs surged.The duo have since been under mounting pressure to reverse course, as polls showed support for their Conservative Party had collapsed, prompting colleagues to openly discuss whether they should be replaced.Having triggered a market rout, Truss now runs the risk of bringing the government down if she cannot find a package of public spending cuts and tax rises that can appease investors and get through any parliamentary vote in the House of Commons.Her search for savings will be made harder by the fact the government has been cutting departmental budgets for years.At the same time the Conservative Party's discipline has all but broken down, fractured by infighting as it struggled first to agree a way to leave the European Union and then how to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and grow the economy.""If you can't get your budget through parliament you can't govern,"" Chris Bryant, a senior lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter. ""This isn't about u-turns, it's about proper governance.""Downing Street has so far declined to comment but Kwarteng had not been expected to appear at Truss's news conference later on Friday, fuelling speculation about his future.During his time in the United States Kwarteng had been told by the head of the International Monetary Fund of the importance of ""policy coherence"", underlining how far Britain's reputation for sound economic management and institutional stability had fallen.Shortly before 11 a.m. (10:00 GMT) Britain's television news channels switched to carry live footage of a British Airways plane landing at Heathrow, carrying Kwarteng.In Westminster, Truss was trying to find agreement with her cabinet ministers on a way to preserve her push for growth while also reassuring the markets and working out which of the measures could be supported by her lawmakers in parliament.Earlier a minister in the trade department, Greg Hands, had said people wanting details on the budget would have to wait until Oct. 31 when Kwarteng was due to set out his full plan alongside independent forecasts that will show the cost of the tax cuts to the public finances and whether they will boost economic growth.Critics of the government had said that wait was unacceptable.Rupert Harrison, a portfolio manager at Blackrock and once an adviser to former British finance minister George Osborne, said markets have now almost fully priced in a U-turn.""(That) means if the U-turn doesn't come markets will react badly,"" he said on Twitter.INTERNATIONAL CREDIBILITYA Conservative Party lawmaker, who asked not to be named, said Truss's economic policy had caused so much damage that investors may demand even deeper cuts to public spending as the price for their support.""Everything's possible at the moment,"" said the lawmaker, who backed Sunak in the leadership race. ""Problem is the markets have lost trust in the Conservative Party - and who can blame them?""Another lawmaker told Reuters earlier this week that Truss needed to appreciate that there was not a huge amount of enthusiasm for her at the moment.According to a source close to the prime minister, Truss is now in ""listening mode"" and inviting lawmakers to speak to her team about their concerns to gauge which parts of the programme they would support in parliament.Credit Suisse economist Sonali Punhani said markets needed to see a credible fiscal plan, with the government needing to find around 60 billion pounds through tax cut U-turns and further spending cuts.""It would be challenging to deliver the scale of these cuts, but for them to be credible, these need to be delivered sooner rather than in the latter part of the forecast,"" Punhani said.One policy that is expected to be reversed is their plan to hold corporation tax rates at 19%. That had formed a key part of their package after Sunak proposed increasing it to 25% when he was finance minister under Truss's predecessor Boris Johnson."

""Passion is a very powerful word. Since the beginning of his photography journey, 27-year-old Sohel Ahmed has always been very passionate about photography. To him, photography is a place where he can find peace and happiness.Ahmed lives in Dhaka, and completed his Engineering degree in EEE from AUST. Photography first captured his imagination when he was in his undergrad. The first camera he ever bought was mainly for traveling purpose, but his interest started to grow gradually.Initially, he was into street, travel and lifestyle photography, but later on, he got interested in wedding photography, where he had the opportunity to work with moments, and started to work on compositions he learned while practicing street and lifestyle photography. He joined some of his seniors at university and started a company, ""Reels and Stories.""""About photography, the best feeling for me is when I'm able to bring out someone's emotion when they look at one of my photographs, be it a smile, tears, or nostalgia.

In Bangladesh, it is not taken as a respectable and wise career option. Sometimes he was very ambiguous about his career but his passion helped him to stay focused. Throughout his career, he achieved many international awards in wedding photography. He won awards for competitions like ""Siena Creative Photo Awards,"" ""International Photography Awards,"" and ""Pink Lady Food Photographer of the Year.""

The pre wedding photoshoot took place in New York and the grand wedding took place at Columbus in Ohio. He also had the opportunity to travel across the USA.""After travelling across USA for a month, I realized that people here give so much priority and respect to art and creativity, which inspired me to chase my dream.

He emphasised organising more awareness campaigns and workshops to make the younger citizens aware of cyber security.Noting that some of the most sensational cyber attacks in the world have caused financial losses of billions of dollars, Md Nasim Parvez, Director General of System & Services at BTRC, said that in 2021, the rate of sexual harassment through social media was 7.69%, sharing of offensive images was 5.85% and cyberbullying was 50.16%. In 2022, the rate of online sexual harassment increased to 9.34%. The use of offensive messages reached 6.93% and the rate of cyberbullying rose to 50.27%. Additionally, the seminar shed light on how many links were requested to be removed from popular websites and domains. In 2021, 1,235 requests were made to remove links from websites/domains. In 2022, the number was 645. In both years, the removal rate for links from websites and domains was 100%, meaning all the removal requests were successful.The presentation also highlighted the details of links removed from social media in 2021 and 2022: 8,916 links were removed from Facebook in 2021, while 8,228 links were removed in 2022. 1,013 links were removed from YouTube in 2021 and 222 in 2022. In 2022, 1,159 links were removed from TikTok, 67 were removed from Bigo, Likee and Imo, and 29 from Twitter."
/business/economy/news/the-death-traditional-telecomsis-it-imminent-3142476,The death of traditional telecoms: Is it imminent?,"Don't panic! Telecoms are not going anywhere! But technology will certainly be hugely disrupted with the advent of high bandwidth and low-latency satellite internet.  Elon Musk has pioneered the disruption by launching Starlink, which puts traditional telecom companies under an imminent threat. Tower and fibre companies would, therefore, need to have their own survival strategy.Recently, one of the potential competitors of Starlink studied the Bangladesh market to figure out if it is feasible for them to provide low-cost high bandwidth and low-latency internet access from 2025. The same company has a plan to launch more than 12,000 low orbit satellites in the next few years. And they found it feasible to provide back-haul support to mobile network operators (MNOs).Let's understand the traditional telecom versus satellite infrastructure.The traditional infrastructure transmits and receives signals using land-based towers. Again, the towers are connected through fibre. Each tower covers its own boundary. The reason for problems like weak signals, call drops, low data speed etc, is the absence of towers in close proximity.On the other hand, satellite infrastructure is not dependent on terrestrial systems but utilises satellites orbiting the earth. This allows satellite signals to cover a much wider area.Imagine a future where an effective satellite will be deployed at a substantially lower cost than what it is today, and a 25GB 5G data plan being sold at $10 per month. The price may look to be a stretch but given the continued trend of rapid innovation and economic rationale, the capex (capital expenditure) cost per user per GB will be lower for satellite infrastructure as against the traditional telecom infrastructure.It must be borne in mind that a satellite can reach way more people than a tower, breaking various natural barriers.Is the traditional telecom infrastructure cheaper or less capex-hungry?If one considers the costs involved in building, updating and maintaining towers and fibres, active equipment investment, investment for rapid change in technology and high taxation, it makes it prohibitively expensive from both capex and opex (operating expense) perspective.However, there are debates over the number of satellites that can fit in LEO. Musk argues that tens of billions of satellites can coexist in LEO as against the current number of 4,500.Some 37 per cent of the world's population is not connected to internet. According to Iridum, a satellite communication company, only 15 per cent of the world's surface is covered by a traditional cellular network.In the case of Bangladesh, more than 60 per cent of the population is not connected to internet.For those living in rural or remote areas, advancement in satellite technology can complement existing terrestrial infrastructure in order to bring these individuals online and remove the digital divide.The government of Bangladesh and the private sector should explore the possibility of using LEO satellites to address the current accessibility issue of the rural and poor population as the best option available instead of relying on MNOs.The author is a telecom and management expert."

We demand immediate release of the arrestees so that they can come back to their normal academic life,"" said the father of Akram Hossain, who was the president of Chhatra Odhiker Parishad's DU chapter.During a separate protest programme in front of the Raju Memorial Sculpture, leaders and activists of Chhatra Odhikar Parishad ""criticised"" the VC for allegedly supporting BCL members for their controversial on-campus activities.Seven days ago, at least 13 students were injured after allegedly being attacked by BCL activists during a rally on the campus premises, marking the death anniversary of Buet student Abrar Fahad, who was killed by BCL members in Buet. The next day, A Dhaka court sent 24 leaders and activists of Chhatra Odhikar Parishad to prison in a case filed against them by two BCL leaders and activists on charges of launching an attack."
