/news/bangladesh/news/identifying-gross-discrepancies-not-hate-campaign-former-nhrc-chairman-3140101,Identifying gross discrepancies is not a ‘hate campaign’: Former NHRC Chairman ,"The UN recently published a report on enforced disappearance, including a list of names that has gained considerable attention and stirred debate both nationally and globally. The debate continued when reputed human rights activist Advocate Sultana Kamal pointed out the errors in the UN report. This was followed by demeaning remarks from the BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, who questioned Sultana Kamal's credibility and impartiality. The debate finally reached its peak when Asian Human Rights Commission accused Bangladesh of launching ""hate campaign"" against the UN experts as renowned intellectuals identified the discrepancy of the UN report, Professor Dr Mizanur Rahman, former Chairman of National Human Rights Commission, writes.Asian Human Rights Commission in its vague statement alleged that the media in Bangladesh, which they referred to as ""pro-government"", and allies of the government are engaging in a campaign to tarnish the UN working group's reputation and question their sincerity on a grave issue like enforced disappearance. What the Commission has, however, failed to consider is that it was not an attempt to vilify any human rights body, rather the intention was to simply pinpoint the inconsistency and inaccuracy of the data coming from an institution like the UN which has always been at the forefront of defending human rights across the globe, he writes.To give voice to human rights – a world that is full of complexity, the institution has not limited itself to mere campaigning but instead has adopted mechanisms to ensure the accountability of perpetrators where necessary through its wide range of mechanisms. This endeavor to secure human rights, that even globally, in one sense, also means that the UN is bestowed with the sheer responsibility of ""being sedulous and attentive"" while dealing with a serious matter like human rights violation. What we have, however, seen in the recent UN report is a slip from what is expected from the institution. The report, while calling on Bangladesh to stop enforced disappearances, heavily relies on information provided by a single source which in turn leads to question its credibility and loss of public faith. The glaring inconsistency in the report owing to its over-reliance on local sources, especially from an NGO with dubious track-record that itself has been accused of publishing a ""distorted report"" in the past, is unfortunate and unexpected, the ex NHRC chairman adds.Accordingly, it runs counter to the values and principles of the UN in collecting data, that is, ensuring transparency, impartiality, and high quality. Instead of following its ethical obligation in assessing data, the UN working group has counted on an NGO that promotes, as is evident in the present case, tendentious remarks, bias and inflammatory claims and resultantly fed the report with data that are inconsistent, lack adequate cross reference and apparently not verified at all, he observes.For instance, in the list of involuntary disappearances of the UN report, it contained an expelled army officer named Hasinur Rahman who in fact came back home in 2019 and has been active on different social media platforms since his return. Hasinur was court-martialed for violating Army service conduct rules. Moreover, among the 76 enforced disappearance cases listed by the UN, at least 10 appear to be living with their families in Bangladesh. On top of that, there are at least 28 names against whom criminal charges have been brought. This indicates a possibility that they might be absconding to evade arrest. Apart from that, the UN report on enforced disappearances has included a person with the charges of arson, narcotics trafficking and murder who is at his home now and trying to get bail from the courts. These are just some examples among the plethora of other questionable data and reporting in the UN report. For a serious issue like enforced disappearance, such lack of rigor and diligence towards data can create confusion and division among the general public, Dr Mizanur writes.Intellectuals and activists like Sultana Kamal, who have worked for decades on the issues of enforced disappearance are well aware of the ramifications of unreliable reporting of these serious human rights issues, and they have correctly pointed out the errors that UN report published. Asian Human Rights Commission translating these justified concerns into the language of hatred is slanderous and disrespectful, at best. Furthermore, summarily calling Bangladeshi media as ""pro-government"" also calls into question AHRC's own intentions and impairs the values of freedom of the press, he says.It should be remembered that Bangladesh was born on the precipice of grave violations of human rights. A nine month-long bloody war was fought for equality, human dignity and social justice for all. Of course, everything is not perfect here, and we have to go a long way to be recognized as a fully human rights compliant state. However, murderers of Bangabandhu and his family members were brought to book, and crimes against humanity committed during 1971 war of liberation have been tried. These examples go to show that Bangladesh is going back to the track of basic human and constitutional rights of due process and rule of law. With regards to the initiatives adopted by the government on enforced disappearance, Bangladesh has been praised by the UN Working Group for its contribution towards crucial cases concerning involuntary disappearances. Human rights defenders should not shy away from acknowledging the positive undertaking done by the government, he suggests.Unfortunately, identifying inaccurate information has been labeled as a ""hate campaign"". In this era of information technology, sensitive data could be manipulated and misused. The AHRC should be aware of these serious consequences, but their allegations of the ""hate campaign"" against Bangladesh itself seem to be a conspiratorial campaign against a sovereign state. There are many examples all around the world where the so-called human rights violations have been weaponized. It would not be unreasonable to think that human rights defenders like the AHRC have a hidden agenda to malign the government and are also trying to incite violence and put the law-and-order situation in danger, he writes.Not a single incident of human rights violation should go unpunished. The government must investigate it and bring the offenders to book. We dream of a Bangladesh where the rule of law and human rights that have been enshrined in our constitution shall be respected fully by all the stakeholders, he says. For this, it might be necessary at times to put pressure on the government, but verily, not in the slanderous manner the AHRC has chosen."
/middle-east/news/mahsa-aminis-death-iran-students-workers-defy-protest-crackdown-3139526,"Mahsa Amini’s death: Iran students, workers defy protest crackdown","Iranian protesters remained defiant yesterday with students staging sit-ins and some industrial workers going on strike despite a crackdown activists say has left dozens dead and hundreds more imprisoned.Videos posted on social media indicated that protests flared at various points in the capital and other cities over recent days, with women burning headscarves and shouting slogans against the Islamic republic.Kurdish rights group Hengaw accused the authorities of using heavy weaponry, including ""shelling"" on neighbourhoods and ""machine gun fire"", in the northwestern city of Sanandaj -- claims which could not be independently confirmed amid widespread internet blocks.Gunshots were also heard in Amini's home town of Saqqez, said the Norway-based group.The unrest erupted over three weeks ago over the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, an Iranian woman of Kurdish origin who died following her arrest by the notorious Tehran morality police who enforce the strict dress rules on women including compulsory headscarf.Activists say she was beaten in custody, while the authorities in Iran have released a medical report blaming a pre-existing condition.The protests have channelled anger among some Iranian women over the compulsory headscarf, but have also seen slogans shouted against the Islamic system created by late revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after the ousting of the shah in 1979.The UK yesterday said it had slapped sanctions on Iran's ""morality police"" after the death in custody of Amini.Oslo-based non-government group Iran Human Rights (IHR) shared images of a sit-in protest at the northern Gilan university and of high school girls in the northern town of Mahabad removing their headscarves.It also posted a video which it said showed a large crowd of students outside Tehran polytechnic yesterday denouncing the ""poverty and corruption"" in Iran and shouting ""death to this tyranny"".Footage shared on social media, including by news site Iran Wire, said students at Tehran women's university Al-Zahra shouted criticism of the regime during a visit Saturday by President Ebrahim Raisi.Student at universities including Tehran Azad also painted their hands red to evoke the crackdown by the authorities on the protests, images showed.State news agency IRNA said police used tear gas late Sunday ""to disperse the crowds in dozens of locations in Tehran"", adding that the demonstrators ""chanted slogans and set fire to and damaged public property, including a police booth"".There have also been signs of labour unrest. Videos broadcast by Persian media based outside Iran showed striking workers burning tyres outside the Asalouyeh petrochemical plant in the country's southwest.IHR said workers were blocking roads there, and there were also reports of strikes at refineries in Abadan in the west of Iran and Kengan in the south.In an act of cyber defiance, the hacking group Edalat-e Ali (Ali's Justice) had posted an image during the main state TV evening news on Saturday of Khamenei in crosshairs and being consumed by flames.The crackdown on the protests sparked by Amini's death has claimed at least 95 lives according to Norway-based group Iran Human Rights.Another 90 people were killed by the security forces in Iran's far southeastern city of Zahedan from September 30 after protests sparked by the alleged rape of a teenage girl by a police chief in the Sistan-Baluchistan province, said IHR, citing the UK-based Baluch Activists Campaign."

/news/bangladesh/news/register-land-their-name-3139671,Register land in their name,"The government should take immediate steps to register the land of indigenous people to ensure their ownership, said discussants at a programme yesterday.Indigenous people have been living on their ancestral lands for centuries. But they don't have ownership due to absence of legal documents.Taking the chance, vested quarters often occupy lands of indigenous people. So, necessary steps should be taken immediately so that these vulnerable people can register their lands properly, said speakers.They were speaking at a discussion titled ""Land related problem of indigenous people and way-out to solve it"" organised by Bangladesh Adivasi Forum at the capital's The Daily Star Centre.Reading out a written statement, the forum's youth volunteer Helena Talang said indigenous people are continuously losing theirs land due to different projects to build dams, national parks, and eco parks.Furthermore, vested quarters are encroaching their land by preparing false documents and using muscle power. So, these lands must be registered properly to protect the indigenous people's rights, said the statement.It also demanded formation of an independent land commission for the indigenous people of plain lands.Besides, they should get constitutional recognition as ""indigenous people"", the statement added.Addressing the event, Dhaka University Professor Mesbah Kamal said a large number of indigenous people have been evicted from their land due to different development projects.A separate land settlement tribunal should be formed immediately to solve such land-related disputes, he said.Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela) chief executive Syeda Rizwana Hasan said Awami League in its electoral manifestos in 2008 and 2014 made multiple commitments to protect rights of indigenous people.But most of the pledges remain unfulfilled due to the government's dilly-dallying approach, she claimed.She also demanded setting up a separate wing in the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) only for indigenous people.Senior journalist Sohrab Hossain said the land grabbers are desperate to occupy lands of indigenous people, as the government in most cases does not take stern action against them.He also called upon civil-society members to raise voice for land rights.Khairul Chowdhury, associate professor at Dhaka University's sociology department, demanded for full implementation of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) Peace Accord to protect these rights.Presiding over the event, Bangladesh Adivasi Forum's general secretary Sanjeeb Drong demanded  the government conduct a digital survey to specifically demarcate lands of indigenous people.Kapaeeng Foundation's executive director Pallab Chakma moderated the programme, where around a dozen people from the indigenous community and rights activists spoke.  "

/star-youth/news/automating-marketing-using-artificial-intelligence-3139691,Automating marketing using artificial intelligence,"Digital marketing has been more important in the success of small and medium-sized enterprises in recent years. With markets changing to a virtual medium and a rising number of individuals purchasing online, companies must establish a strong digital presence.This is a time-consuming activity that entails monitoring many social media accounts, connecting with customers on a daily basis, and eventually investing in the correct marketing strategy.In order to solve this dilemma, Tasfia Tasbin and Rubaiyat Farhan founded Markopolo, a one stop solution for affordable and efficient marketing automation. The duo had the experience of running a pro-bono consulting service in growth marketing. When the pandemic began, they left their jobs, in search of better opportunities, and formed a data analytics related service company.""This allowed us to work with some of the largest agencies and companies in South Asia, which helped us identify this opportunity from their existing workflow. We created a product based on our customer interviews and launched that in Product Hunt. From there, it really took off,"" Rubaiyat shared.Marketing automation is a relatively new idea that entails technology ßthat would help firms to successfully sell across many web platforms. Markopolo's artificial intelligence (AI) software uses the first party data as input and generates ad campaigns, creatives, and copies for placement on multiple platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Google.It helps firms to fully automate their digital marketing efforts, from campaign planning to creative and copy production, A/B testing and ad budget optimisation, basic ad maximisation to running numerous ad campaigns across many platforms. Finally, it provides a comprehensive overview on a single dashboard.The platform also has an in-built suggestion engine, Nucleus, that acts as a professional marketer. ""Till now, we've trained the software's algorithms with 3 million datasets, to make decisions like what ad rules to apply, switching between automatic bidding to manual bidding, and understanding the user's campaign performance,"" he explained.The SaaS startup currently has a global user base of more than 4,700 people from 81 countries. They now plan to focus on the enterprise tier, serving FMCG and retail companies, while integrating retail media within Markopolo.

/business/economy/news/growing-economic-tension-batters-stocks-3139626,Growing economic tension batters stocks,"Stocks in Bangladesh suffered a steep fall yesterday as worries about a slowdown in the economy deepened among investors amid continued stress in the forex market, the decline in export and remittance, higher inflation, and the escalating war in Ukraine.The war, the jump in consumer prices to a multi-year high, and the recession fear in the advanced economies have already handed a severe blow to the economy.The government's warning about rolling blackouts in the coming days and a threat of a global food crisis next year spooked the confidence of investors.The World Bank has slashed its economic growth projection for Bangladesh for the current fiscal year to 6.1 per cent from its previous projection of 6.7 per cent made in June.As a result, the DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), dropped 119 points, or 1.48 per cent, to 6,449 yesterday, the lowest since September 9.Likewise, the Caspi, the all-share price index of the Chattogram Stock Exchange, was down 282 points, or 1.46 per cent, at 19,049.The DS30, the index that consists of blue-chip companies, gave up 2 per cent, while the DSES, the Shariah-complaint index, dipped 1.9 per cent.""The worries about the economy have deepened worldwide and Bangladesh is not a remote island. So, some big investors sold off shares of well-performing stocks, sending the index low,"" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst and a former professor of economics at the University of Dhaka.In the last few weeks, well-performing stocks suffered price fall except for some rumour-based companies, according to Prof Ahmed.""People are shifting funds to the speculative stocks from the good ones. But the rise of the junk stocks does not reflect the real scenario.""European and US markets dropped last week as well.At home, the stock market dropped after the fall in export receipts and remittances, two major foreign currency earners of Bangladesh, highlighting the crisis facing the economy, said Mir Ariful Islam, managing director of Sandhani Asset Management Ltd.Exports slipped 6.25 per cent year-on-year to $3.9 billion in September, while remittances dropped 11 per cent to $1.54 billion.To make the situation worse, Bangladesh witnessed a record 9.5 per cent inflation in August, the highest in 12 years, due to adverse effects of the fuel price hike recently, according to the State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, however, has not published the data officially yet.The latest blow to the market came yesterday owing to widespread Russian missile strikes on cities across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. This was the first time Kyiv has been targeted in months, said BBC News.The war has dealt a major shock to commodity markets and disrupted production and trade of several commodities, particularly those where Russia and Ukraine are key exporters, including energy, fertilizers, and grains, said the World Bank earlier.In another blow for the oil importing nations like Bangladesh, oil prices rose for five straight days before falling yesterday. Brent crude oil stood at $97 yesterday, up 10 per cent from $88 on October 3, according to oilprice.com.Referring to her interactions with world leaders and the United Nations Secretary-General, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said last week that all were very much anxious and apprehended that there might be a grave famine in 2023. She suggested not to let not any land uncultivated, according to the news agency BSS. Earlier, the Bangladesh Bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent in order to contain higher consumer prices, a move that would make funds costlier.As a result, money circulation is going to shrink and this has had an impact on the market, Prof Ahmed said.Sandhani Asset Management's Islam went on to say that a rumour was spread in the market that the floor price might be withdrawn, accelerating selling pressure.In July, the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) reintroduced the floor price to halt the free fall of the market amidst global economic uncertainties.The stocks nosedived due to the heavy sell pressures by the anxious investors as the rumour spread in the market over the floor price withdrawal, said International Leasing Securities Ltd in its daily market review.The BSEC, however, said no discussion regarding revoking the floor price had taken place.A top official of a merchant bank says some companies are going to raise funds in the coming months so some investors have sold shares to subscribe to the securities of the new companies.Among them, Asiatic Laboratories and Global Islami Bank are set to raise Tk 520 crore, DSE data showed."

State wildlife services managed to refloat 44 of the mammals."

/business/economy/news/internet-banking-transactions-double-july-3139596,Internet banking transactions double in July,"Internet banking transactions nearly doubled to Tk 23,548 crore in July compared to a year earlier, central bank figures showed as more people in Bangladesh are using computers and mobile apps to access various financial services.  It stood at Tk 12,768 crore in the same month in 2021. July's internet banking transactions amount, however, were slightly lower than Tk 23,770 crore in June, according to the Bangladesh Bank.Internet banking, popularly known as online banking, allows users to conduct financial transactions via internet and offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments.Introduced in Bangladesh by Standard Chartered two decades ago, internet banking has grown at a faster clip in the country since then.The pace has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic since consumers were compelled to turn to internet to access finances from the conveniences of their homes in a bid to avoid catching the deadly virus.The number of customers using internet banking to carry out transactions digitally rose more than 43 per cent year-on-year to 54.72 lakh in July, as more consumers embrace technologies to buy financial services thanks to convenience and efficiency.It was 38.22 lakh in July last year and 53.55 lakh in June this year. The pace has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic since consumers were compelled to turn to internet to access finances from the conveniences of their homesThe pace has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic since consumers were compelled to turn to internet to access finances from the conveniences of their homes""Customers who use internet banking service just once become glued to it,"" said Amin Md Mehedi Hasan, vice-president and head of digital banking of Eastern Bank Ltd.""Internet banking has exponentially grown since the pandemic struck the world.""He cited that customer migration from the traditional banking channel to online banking saw a 600 per cent increase at EBL in 2020 and 2021. And 91 per cent of transactions take place online at the private commercial bank while the rest through branches.Md Mezbaul Haque, director of the Payment Systems Department of the central bank, recalled that when he joined the Payment Systems Department in 2016, only Tk 2 crore to Tk 3 crore used to be transferred through interbank online banking daily.""Now it has surged to Tk 150 crore to Tk 200 crore daily.""Haque thinks online banking is the future of banking as technologies advance and people's approach to banking goes through a major shift.""Not many people will be interested in visiting branches. This is happening all over the world,"" he said.According to Haque, internet banking is also cost-effective for banks as well as it allows them to use technologies to provide the financial services that a brick-and-mortar branch is currently providing.This means that if banking takes place online and over the phone, banks would be able to cut the huge operating expenses needed to cater services in the traditional form.""This is the only way for banks to minimise costs and ensure efficiency,"" said Haque.For individuals, the maximum value of each transaction is Tk 3 lakh through internet banking. The frequency is a maximum of 10 times a day and not more than Tk 10 lakh per day, according to the BB.For corporate, the limit has been set at Tk 5 lakh per transaction. The maximum frequency is 20 times while a total of Tk 25 lakh could be transacted per day.In July, fund transfers through the Bangladesh Electronic Fund Transfer Network (BEFTN) rose to Tk 40,488 crore, up nearly 23 per cent from Tk 32,986 crore in the same month last year. It was, however, lower than June's Tk 45,369 crore, data from the central bank showed.Rolled out in 2011, the BEFTN was the country's first paperless electronic inter-bank funds transfer system. It facilitates both credit and debit transactions, as a lead over the cheque-clearing system.It can handle credit transfers such as payroll, foreign and domestic remittances, social security payments, company dividends, bill payments, corporate payments, government tax payments, social security payments, and person-to-person payments.Besides, it accommodates payments such as insurance premiums, club/association subscription fees, and equated monthly instalments.Transactions through the Bangladesh Real Time Gross Settlement (BD-RTGS), which has been executing high-value and time-critical payments since 2015, nearly tripled to Tk 415,052 crore in July from Tk 144,410 crore a year earlier.But the settlement was nearly 24 per cent lower than June's Tk 543,956 crore.Whereas the transactions through the RTGS are real-time, those routed through the BEFTN are not. Besides, the central bank does not allow the use of RTGS to transfer an amount that is lower than Tk 1 lakh. Internet banking was a fund transfer and mobile recharge tool in the past. Now, it has become a part of daily lifestyle, EBL's Hasan said.""The petty cash support a person needs every day is being catered to by almost all banks in Bangladesh. Internet banking has transformed from a value-added service into a requirement in a span of five years.""  "

In June, Bangladesh suffered defeats in all three matches of Asian Cup Qualifiers but they showed signs of improvement in the first two matches before getting crushed at the hands of Malaysia in the third match.""If you look back, the booters drew with Nepal in their fourth match of the SAFF Championship when they needed a victory to progress to the final. They also suffered defeat against hosts Sri Lanka in their last match of an invitational tournament in Colombo while needing just a draw to play the final,"" said the National Team's Committee chairman Kazi Nabil Ahmed at a press briefing following a meeting with Cabrera and Paul Smalley at the BFF House today.""Similarly, in June, the boys showed their improvements against Bahrain and Turkmenistan during the Asian Cup Qualifiers but suffered heavily against Malaysia in the third match. Apparently the booters can't do well in the third or fourth matches. Why? We have discussed the matter with the coach and technical director and we have to find out how to overcome this problem,"" Ahmed added.Under the guidance of Cabrera, Bangladesh won one and drew two out of eight matches in the last seven months since the 37-year-old Spaniard was appointed as the head coach.Although Cabrera and Smalley looked gloomy after the meeting, the national teams' committee neither expressed full satisfaction nor dissatisfaction over the Spanish coach.With nearly three months left for Cabrera's one-year contract to expire, and no international engagements in this period, the question has been raised regarding whether Cabrera's contract will be extended or not?""The contract extension with the coach is a different matter because today we reviewed the different things of the national teams, such as team's outcomes, preparation, performance on the ground during their matches of the FIFA window in June and September,"" said the national teams' committee chairman.""We will sit again after four weeks and in that time, we will take our decision [whether to extend the contract or not] because this matter is not an emergency one at the moment,"" he added.Asked how much the committee was satisfied with the performance of Cabrera, Nabil said, ""It is not a matter of satisfaction, it is an ongoing matter.

As a result, small investors did not show much interest in buying them, said an official of a merchant bank.In Bangladesh, according to him, most of the investors are rushing towards the stocks that could help them double their investment quickly so they did not choose government securities.""However, it is a good product for long-term investors. Some of them may seek to buy bills and bonds in the upcoming days.""The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission has allowed the trading of treasury bills and bonds on the DSE and the Chittagong Stock Exchange on a trial basis.While stocks are ownership in a company, bonds are a loan to a company or government. Because they are a loan, with a set interest payment, a maturity date, and a face value that the borrower will repay, they tend to be far less volatile than stocks, according to The Motley Fool, a financial and investing advice company based in Alexandria, Virginia.In Bangladesh, there are about 270 treasury bonds worth more than Tk 2.5 lakh crore with their tenures ranging from two years to 20 years, data from the Bangladesh Bank showed.

Tickets were expensive... but no price (is) too heavy,"" he said.Japan slammed its borders shut early in the pandemic, at one point even barring foreign residents from returning, and has only recently begun cautiously reopening.In June, it began allowing tourists to visit in groups accompanied by guides, a requirement that was further relaxed to include self-guided package tours.From Tuesday, visa-free entry resumed for travellers from 68 countries and territories.Japan is also lifting a cap on the number of arrivals and ending the package tour requirement.Some rules remain, with tourists required to present either proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken three days before departure.Before Covid-19, Japan's government was on track to achieve a goal of 40 million visitors by 2020, the year Tokyo was supposed to host the Summer Olympics.Japan received a record 31.9 million foreign visitors in 2019, but that plummeted to just 250,000 in 2021.In Japan, tourists will find a country that is still adhering to many of the health guidelines that helped it to keep pandemic deaths to around 45,500, lower than many other developed economies.Masks are ubiquitous, and though not mandated by law, Parliament is set to pass legislation allowing hotels to deny service to customers who refuse to wear one or observe other health rules.Masks are worn not only indoors and on public transport, but even outdoors, despite the government saying they are not necessary outside in uncrowded settings.Hand sanitisers are placed at the entrance of most businesses, while plastic dividers are also often used in restaurants.Another major change for tourists will be the weakness of the yen, which is hovering around 145 to the dollar, a level not seen for two decades.The government has already had to intervene once to prop up the currency, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida cited the yen's weakness as a factor he hoped would draw tourists when he announced the reopening.There is certainly no shortage of demand, according to travel agents.Since the September announcement of the planned reopening, ""we've been absolutely drowning, we don't have enough time to deal with all the requests"", said Antoine Chanthavong, of Paris-based travel agency Destination Japan.Still, for now at least, tickets are not coming cheap, with fuel prices soaring and airlines forced to take circuitous routes to avoid Russian airspace.And for all the rebound in demand, there is little expectation that tourist numbers will soon reach their 2019 levels.Before the pandemic, travellers from Hong Kong and China made up 37 per cent of all foreign visitors to Japan, and 44 per cent of tourism income.But tough Covid-19 restrictions in China make it unlikely visitors from there will be flocking back to Japan anytime soon."

It is given out to nominees aged 9–25, who are carrying out humanitarian activities for at least a year.This year, eight young changemakers from Bangladesh received the award, including Manisha Meem Nipun, cofounder of Pathchola Foundation.The youth trainer and human rights activist has been working as the representative of the transgender community in Dhaka, Mymensingh, Khulna, Rangpur, and Chattogram. In 2019, she started working for the Pathchola Foundation as a founding member.This organisation started out with the mission to address the lack of employability skills, education, and human rights for the gender-diverse population in Bangladesh. Pathchola Foundation has also rescued ten transgender individuals from sex work, and helped them build sustainable livelihoods through hard skills and soft skills training. Based in Chattogram, Manisha Meem Nipun was born as a boy. Her birth name was Mohammed Jahidul Islam. Since birth, she was never interested in what would typically deem as activities for boys. Instead, she found herself fascinated with the type of things that are normally associated with girls. This resulted in Meem being bullied from an early age.After being enrolled in journalism and media studies at university, Meem faced further bullying, due to her gender identity crisis and financial crisis. As a result, she would drop out of university. After this, she began working for INGOs until 2019, when she created her own organisation, ""Pathchola Foundation"".Pathchola Foundation started as a messenger group, which gained the official foundation structure in 2020. After COVID-19 pandemic hit, the group was supporting 1,112 people from a diverse population, which gained traction and 25 organisations started supporting them.Right now, it is a transgender and gender-diverse youth-led non-profit welfare organisation focusing on the rights and livelihoods of gender and sexual minority communities in Bangladesh.With 10 core members and 70 volunteers, the organisation has impacted the lives of more than 3,000 transgender people in Dhaka, Chattogram, Mymensingh, Rangpur, and Khulna.Although they started off with just an emergency response for food and cash for nine months—through donors and NGOs—Pathchola Foundation extended its branches in many more sectors.They have been hosting winter clothing distribution programmes, life skill and social development workshops, leadership and volunteerism workshops, and many more.Alongside relief and aid programmes, they provide campaigns on art therapy, dance therapy, coffee house campaigns, and HIV. They have helped five transgender women with sewing machines and training in Mohammadpur. They have also helped 10 transgender people receive seed funds from UNDP and are currently working with 72 transgender people to receive beautification and soft skill training.After their campaign ""Education for Transgenders"", Open University now allows people to choose their respective gender identities, and transgender people receive a 60 percent waiver during the admission process.During the floods in Sylhet and Sunamganj, they conducted an emergency response where they provided BDT 103,000 to 56 gender-diverse people over two phases.The organisation has received the Sheikh Hasina National Youth Volunteer Award 2020, The Millennium Fellowship 2021, United Nations Volunteers award 2021, and The Diana Award 2022. The organisation also made it to the top 31 groups in the Joy Bangla Youth Award. In Meem's eyes, in order to create an inclusive Bangladesh, the first and foremost step is to introduce proper sex education and topics on gender-identity diversity in schools. ""If we cannot let go of the social stigma around transgenders and the gender-diverse population, we cannot create an inclusive Bangladesh,"" said Meem.The young changemaker plans to enrich her brainchild, ""Pathchola Foundation"" even further. Going forward, she plans to collaborate with many more organisations in order to ensure the human rights of transgender and gender-diverse people across Bangladesh.The author is a freelance journalist.

I have been living alone for seven years now. It would not have been possible without the support of my family, who have always stood by my side. Now, I am content with whatever I have.
Currently, I am busy raising my son. Everyone makes mistakes, and I did too. But above all, life is beautiful.



Did you ever have to struggle?
I think every creative person has to struggle at some point in their lives. It has been three years since my father passed away. Having a father is everything for a girl. Right now, I am going against the flow. I am grateful for the hardship that God has given me. If He hadn't given me the hard times, I wouldn't know the true nature of some people.

After my divorce, I wasn't in my senses for a long time. A girl can be the strongest when she has the support of her father. I also thought that, no matter what happens, I will stand on my feet.
Seeing my son grow up, has been a surreal experience. Now, he has become the person that gives me strength. That's how I rediscovered myself.
At present, I feel pure, almost like gold. I am an independent woman who is now in the right place.
 








Tomorrow is your birthday. Do you have any special plans for the occasion?
On every birthday, I go somewhere far away to celebrate. This time, I will travel to Singapore. Today, I will spend time with my family and celebrate my birthday with them. Then, I will go to Singapore tomorrow, and will come back before my son's birthday, which is just around the corner. Then, we will celebrate his birthday.
You can only enjoy life if you want to. Life flows like a river, meeting the sea, eventually becoming waves. Once, I too was like the waves of the sea, but one incident in my life made me an isolated person.The happiness and the beauty of life was lost. I was far away from the waves of life. As no pain in our life is permanent, I pulled myself out of this dark place.I have been living alone for seven years now. It would not have been possible without the support of my family, who have always stood by my side. Now, I am content with whatever I have.Currently, I am busy raising my son. Everyone makes mistakes, and I did too. But above all, life is beautiful.Did you ever have to struggle?
I think every creative person has to struggle at some point in their lives. It has been three years since my father passed away. Having a father is everything for a girl. Right now, I am going against the flow. I am grateful for the hardship that God has given me. If He hadn't given me the hard times, I wouldn't know the true nature of some people.

/opinion/views/news/time-higher-education-bangladesh-evolve-3139961,Time for higher education in Bangladesh to evolve,"Four years have passed since I moved to Bangladesh from the UK to serve as a registrar, first at Asian University for Women and then at Brac University. I loved Bangladesh from the moment of touchdown in Chattogram: a country and region of transcendent beauty, resourcefulness and sense of the vibration of life.Coming from the UK, it is natural to make comparisons between the Bangladesh and UK higher education systems. There is much to learn on both sides. One of the obvious comparisons is that it generally takes far less time for full-time students to graduate in the UK than Bangladesh – three years in most cases, although there are variations. Higher education in the UK, and more widely, in Europe has, of course, had much longer to become established, with a remarkably strong research base, well-developed links with industry, and good practice in effective, dynamic approaches to teaching, learning, and student support.Bangladesh has an opportunity, however, to avoid some of the mistakes that have occurred recently in UK higher education policy. There is presently a reductionist tendency in public policy in the UK, more particularly in England, to judge the value of higher education on the basis of short-term career outcomes and starting salaries for graduates.We want to work in partnership with our students, not to see them primarily as customers, but to encourage their appreciation of the value of higher education. That involves challenge, self-discipline and personal transformation. Students are invited to become good, thoughtful, socially responsible citizens committed to a life of sustained service to humanity. We must help students to learn, encouraging active rather than passive learning, critical thinking, hard and soft skills, resourcefulness, entrepreneurship, and avoiding overemphasis on examinations, which stifles learning.Bangladesh faces a curious challenge. There are high rates of graduate unemployment alongside evidence of the need for high-level graduate skills to meet the demands of a massive social and technological revolution. Many countries have invested heavily in higher education as their economies move from low wage manufacturing into diverse economies based on knowledge and high-level skills.There are often criticisms of higher education institutions: questions whether too many people enter university and whether they are studying the right subjects. There are debates about the actual impact of higher education on student learning. The extent of university investment in vocational education is considerable, however, and often underestimated by commentators. The contribution of higher education to the economy around the world is well-evidenced, coming from research, knowledge exchange, professional training, workforce development, innovation, and creativity.Each year, concerns are expressed through the national media about the relatively poor performance of Bangladeshi universities in world league tables. Really, Bangladesh just has not played the league table ""game""; with a few exceptions, universities have not systematically focused on the criteria that inform the league table results. League tables are a marketing device that give a distorted impression, and the comparisons between institutions are highly questionable. Yet league tables can also be a powerful stimulus for institutional improvement and visibility. There is an urgent need for substantial, nationwide improvement in higher education in Bangladesh. Some universities are engaged in significant development and there are various national initiatives, but the clock is ticking as international competition grows stronger and talented Bangladeshi graduates are disadvantaged against their contemporaries in other countries.Prof Vincent Chang, vice-chancellor of Brac University, has observed, ""Of particular concern is Bangladesh's failure to establish any globally ranked universities at the time when the country is trying to become a diversified knowledge-based economy. Higher education institutions are generally regarded as the enabling vehicles for the creation of knowledge-based industries because they ensure that future knowledge workers have the skills and competences to become globally competitive. The reason for this failure is largely down to a lack of investment in the higher education system. In the last half a century, East Asian economies have transitioned from low wage manufacturing economies into diversified knowledge-based economies. To achieve this, they have invested heavily in their higher education institutions and unashamedly imported international expertise and best practice methods…""Facing the profound social and technological change of a new industrial revolution, Bangladesh can reap considerable benefits through reform of higher education. There are various ingredients that are necessary to a thriving higher education sector. Many of those ingredients are included already in the national Bangladesh Strategic Plan for Higher Education 2018-2030.It can take years to develop new programmes of study even when they address urgent national, social, and economic needs. Meanwhile, some other countries race ahead without those constraints. There is an imperative for Bangladesh to introduce a more effective and timely approach to academic programme development before the country loses irreparably to international competitors.It does not have to be that way. The national quality assurance system should focus mainly on outputs rather than inputs. Some years ago, the UK Quality Assurance Agency created an institutional review which involves a periodic assessment of quality and standards in each institution, conducted through a physical visit by teams of trained peer reviewers. Within an outcome-based system of national accreditation in Bangladesh, institutions with demonstrably robust systems could be given greater freedom to pursue programme development and educational innovation.There appears to be a counterproductive tendency to see the public and private universities in a position of opposition to each other. There are persistent challenges for private universities to introduce new programmes, to try innovative approaches to teaching and learning and to bring industry into the classroom. We are in the strange situation where some private university faculties are able to supervise doctoral students in leading international universities, but not in their home country. The restriction on leading private universities awarding PhDs in subject areas where they have demonstrable and sustainable expertise is also a restriction on the growth of research for national benefit, of high quality postgraduate provision, and an increase in the numbers of highly qualified faculty across Bangladesh.There is much talk in higher education circles of the value of ""internationalisation."" ""Internationalisation"" is about the higher education sector valuing diversity and functioning in an intimately connected, borderless world, where ideas and knowledge are shared. The theme of internationalisation is in the tradition of Rabindranath Tagore, who supported a concept of global community and who called for ""unity in diversity,"" expressed in the ideas for his own schools and Visva-Bharati University.The development of international academic partnerships should be evaluated carefully as Bangladesh becomes more attractive to international providers. Bangladesh may lose through partnerships which just lead students away to study in other countries, maybe never to return, or which damage good local providers through unfair competition. There is a need for genuine, two-way international partnership, mutual learning and capacity-building for Bangladesh. Indeed, other countries and their higher education sectors have much to learn from Bangladesh, which has profound expertise from the experience of nation-building and social and economic development over half a century. Dr Dave Dowland is registrar of Brac University and former registrar and chief operating officer of Asian University for Women.

So, their bail petitions should be granted, the lawyer added.The prosecution, however, opposed the defence plea on grounds that the charges brought against them were primarily proved.Upon hearing both the sides, the magistrate rejected their bail petition.Earlier on Saturday (October 8, 2022), all the 24 accused were sent to Dhaka Central Jail in Keraniganj after they were produced before another Dhaka.Chhatra League Organising Secretary Nazim Uddin and activist Aminur Rahman filed the cases with Shahbagh Police Station accusing 25 and 140-150 unnamed people.Police on Friday (October 7, 2022) detained 24 parishad men at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and from nearby areas in connection with the incident.

/sports/football/news/xavi-hunting-lewandowski-supply-line-vital-week-3139856,Xavi hunting for Lewandowski supply-line in vital week,"Robert Lewandowski has proven over the years that he is a guarantee of goals, as long as he gets the ball.Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez is searching for answers to that problem, with his team's form dipping at just the wrong moment, as they welcome Inter Milan and then face Real Madrid in the Clasico this week.The Italian side visit Camp Nou on Wednesday in a near life-or-death Champions League clash, before Barca visit the Santiago Bernabeu in a battle to move clear at the top of La Liga.Coinciding with the team's struggles, reflected by a 1-0 defeat at Inter last week and a shaky 1-0 win over Celta Vigo on Sunday, has been Lewandowski's goal-rush drying up.After netting in six consecutive La Liga games, the Polish striker could not continue the streak against Celta, having been shut out at the San Siro as Inter ganged up to stop him.""We've not been in our best moment since the international break,"" said Xavi on Sunday. ""Three weeks ago we were flying, and now we're not, we have to improve.""Lewandowski's goals -- nine in La Liga, making him the division's top scorer – have helped Barcelona move top of the table for the first time since June 2020.The Catalans are unbeaten in the Spanish top flight, but it's a different story in Europe. Successive defeats on the road to  Bayern Munich and Inter leave them in desperate need of a win on Wednesday.Perhaps the worrying thing is Lewandowski has not been missing chances in the past three matches, which might have been a temporary problem, his team-mates have not been creating them.The Polish forward's accurate finish earned Barcelona a 1-0 win over Mallorca on October 1, but it was a chance he created himself. He has barely had a sniff of goal in the subsequent two games.""He was uncomfortable in the second half (against Celta) but so was the whole team,"" said Xavi. ""We have to find him more.""Barcelona's wingers had a poor night at Camp Nou, with Ferran Torres and Raphinha missing chances early on and finding themselves unable to connect with Lewandowski. When Ansu Fati and Ousmane Dembele came on in the second half, the story did not change.""Maybe they are getting anxious, looking to score,"" added the coach. ""The forwards need goals to generate confidence.""Inter lined up with five defenders at the San Siro and could operate even more defensively on the road, knowing a draw leaves them in a good position.In Italy, they managed to disrupt Pedri and Gavi, with the creative midfield duo struggling for influence, while the wingers resorted to slinging crosses into the area, which were easily dealt with.The match, and Barcelona's future in the competition, may come down to whether Xavi can create a supply line for Lewandowski against suffocating defences, determined to stop him."

/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/ukraine-strengthen-armed-forces-us-says-will-provide-advanced-air-defence-3139791,"Ukraine to strengthen armed forces, US says will provide air defence","-- Attacks across Ukrainian cities during Monday rush hour-- Fourteen dead and 97 injured, says Ukraine-- Zelenskiy after Biden call: Air defence is number 1 priorityUkraine vowed to strengthen its armed forces after Russia launched its biggest aerial assaults on cities since the beginning of the war, forcing thousands to flee to bomb shelters and prompting Kyiv to halt electricity exports to Europe.Missiles hit targets across Ukraine on Monday morning, killing 14 people and injuring scores, as they tore into intersections, parks and tourist sites.Explosions were reported in Kyiv, Lviv, Ternopil and Zhytomyr in western Ukraine, Dnipro and Kremenchuk in the centre, Zaporizhzhia in the south and Kharkiv in the east, Ukrainian officials said.The barrage of dozens of cruise missiles fired from air, land and sea was the most widespread wave of air strikes to hit away from the front line, at least since the initial volleys on the war's first day, February 24.Russian President Vladimir Putin said he ordered ""massive"" long-range strikes after accusing Ukraine of an attack on a bridge linking Russia to annexed Crimea on Saturday, but the United States said the scale of the attacks meant they had likely been planned for longer.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke to US President Joe Biden on Monday and wrote on Telegram afterwards that air defence was the ""number 1 priority in our defence cooperation.""""We will do everything to strengthen our armed forces,"" he said in a Monday night address. ""We will make the battlefield more painful for the enemy.""Biden told Zelenskiy the United States will provide advanced air defence systems. The Pentagon said on September 27 it would start delivering the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System over the next two months or so.A total of 14 people were killed and 97 were injured, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reported. The rush-hour attacks were deliberately timed to kill people and knock out Ukraine's power grid, according to Zelenskiy.Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal reported 11 major infrastructure targets were hit in eight regions, leaving parts of Ukraine with no electricity, water or heat. He promised to restore utilities as quickly as possible.As it tried to end blackouts, Ukraine halted electricity exports to the European Union, at a time when the continent already faces surging power prices that have stoked inflation, hampered industrial activity and caused sky-high consumer bills.The Kremlin's air strikes come three days after a blast damaged the bridge it built after seizing Crimea in 2014. Russia blamed Ukraine and called the deadly explosion ""terrorism"".""To leave such acts without a response is simply impossible,"" said Putin, alleging other, unspecified attacks on Russian energy infrastructure. He threatened more strikes in future if Ukraine hits Russian territory.The United States, however, said attacks of such a scale could not have been put together in just a couple of days.""It likely was something that they had been planning for quite some time,"" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. ""That's not to say that the explosion on the Crimea bridge might have accelerated some of their planning.""Ukraine, which views the bridge as a military target sustaining Russia's war effort, celebrated the blast without claiming responsibility.After weeks of setbacks on the battlefield, Russian authorities are facing the first sustained domestic criticism of the war, with commentators on state television demanding ever tougher measures.Putin responded to Ukrainian advances by ordering a mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists, proclaiming the annexation of occupied territory and threatening to use nuclear weapons.On Saturday, Russia made its third senior military appointment in the space of a week by appointing Air Force General Sergei Surovikin as commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. He previously commanded Russia's brutal air campaign in Syria.Russia says it is waging a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine to rid it of nationalists and protect Russian-speaking communities. Ukraine and the West say it is an unprovoked war of aggression.Monday's blasts tore a huge crater next to a children's playground in one of central Kyiv's busiest parks. The remains of an apparent missile were buried, smoking in the mud. More volleys struck the capital again later in the morning.Ukraine's defence ministry said in its evening update Russia had staged at least 84 missile and air strikes, and Ukraine's air defences had destroyed 43 cruise missiles and 13 drones.Russia's defence ministry said it had hit all its intended targets. Reuters could not independently verify battlefield accounts.Russia also suffered a setback on the diplomatic front, with the UN General Assembly voting to reject Moscow's call for the 193-member body to hold a secret ballot later this week on whether to condemn its annexations four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. read moreThe General Assembly decided, with 107 votes in favor, that it would hold a public vote - not a secret ballot.The president of the United Arab Emirates, a member of the group of oil producers known as OPEC+ that rebuffed the United States last week by announcing steep cuts last week, will travel to Russia on Tuesday to meet Putin and push for ""military de-escalation"", UAE state news agency WAM reported.Biden and Group of Seven leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Tuesday to discuss their commitment to support Ukraine, the White House said."

The BWCW, presented by TRESemmé and driven by Mercedes-Benz, displayed outfits, jewellery, and accessories for the three major days of a wedding: holud, wedding, and reception.Among the A-list guests was Enrico Nunziata, the Italian Ambassador to Bangladesh, who took to the stage multiple times through the course of the 3-day event.The day of the reception is often the time when the bride and groom as well as the wedding guests are all too eager to step out of the boundary of traditional colours, designs, and accessories. Taking this into account, the three distinguished designer brands in the show, Zurhem, Sarah Karim Couture, and Sahar Rahman Couture, brought out the very best of pastel hues and unique patterns along the deeper colours.The show kicked off with an extraordinary collection of wedding jewellery from Jarwa House. However, unlike the previous two days where the primary focus was on gold, for reception jewellery Jarwa House played with diamonds, multicoloured rubies, and emeralds. Nusraat Faria, one of the most popular actresses of recent times and the face of Jarwa House, walked the ramp sporting a minimalist choker with a layered neckpiece, a pair of dazzling earrings, and a single-lined tikli.Sahar Rahman Couture took the stage next, bringing their A-game in pastels. Their collection consisted of heavily embellished outfits in pink, peach, off-white, and pale lime-green colours. In a variety of sari, lehenga, and kameez, this brand displayed the perfect balance of tradition and modernity in its outfits.Sarah Karim took an interesting turn in her colour selection starting with some jewel-toned midnight blue lehengas, gowns, and kameezes. Deep in colour yet miles away from looking traditional, these outfits are for people who do not shy away from making a statement.Various shades of green and silver also graced her design in a combination of georgette and chiffon with works of crystals and kundan done on them. The magic of this designer shone through her crystal work on the Jamdani sari, giving this elegant attire a new edge.Zurhem, being a big platform men's collection, brought some of its most exclusive suits for grooms-to-be.

/news/bangladesh/news/food-court-bahadur-shah-park-3139656,Food court in Bahadur Shah Park!,"Surrounded by greenery on  all sides, Bahadur Shah Park stands proud with its rich history and  enriched architectural features at Old Dhaka's Laxmibazar.The place was known as Victoria Park, named after Queen Victoria, former Queen of the British Empire. Later in 1957, the park was renamed after the last Mughal emperor, Mirza Abu Zafar Sirajuddin Muhammad Bahadur Shah Zafar, popularly known as Bahadur Shah II.In 1857, during the Sepoy Mutiny against colonial rulers, English soldiers publicly executed the captured mutineers by hanging them from different trees of the place.There are  two memorials at the park entrances. The tallest one is situated at the eastern side, in memory of the martyred sepoys.As baffling as it may sound, rather than preserving the place by keeping its glory intact,  Dhaka South City Corporation is mulling to construct a food court at the place.A metal structure  has already been set up in the middle of the park, but it could not be completed due to huge protests from concerned citizens.Every day, thousands of  people visit the park for exercising and leisure activities.Upendra Nath Biswas, councillor of ward-36, said this is a historical heritage, setting up a food court here will harm its sanctity.""We are totally against it, as a food court in the middle of the park will destroy the park's aesthetic and reduce its space,"" he added.Md Elias Hossain, an advocate of Bangladesh Supreme Court, said they conducted some yearly programmes at the park marking significant events of the nation's history. This food court will hamper such programmes, he said.The advocate also highlighted how construction of a food court will mean one less playground for the area's children.Aktharuzzaman Khan, general secretary of Jatiya Ganotantric Front, who, along with many others, is protesting the move, said contractors first took initiative to set up the structure for the food court in the second week of September.Initially, students broke the structure and the contractor set it up again with the help of local administration, he said.Akhtaruzzaman said locals are protesting the move by holding human chains and rallies.He said if the park turns into a business centre in the name of a food court, it will ruin its main spirit.Adil Mohammad Khan, former general secretary of Bangladesh Institute of Planners, said, ""Leasing out open spaces of the capital for commercial use has become a common tendency of  city corporation, as the same thing can be seen in Suhrawardy Udyan.""Contacted, Ward-42 Councillor Mohammad Selim said a food court is being constructed taking the permission of DSCC.The project-in-charge will take care of the park, set up CCTV cameras, set up more lights and  conduct cleaning activities.""We are failing to protect the park for which the city corporation has given the responsibility  to a contractor,"" he said.The councillor didn't disclose the name of the contractor. He, however, said the name of the company is DAR Holding Limited.Contacted, Chief Estate Officer of DSCC Md Rasel Sabrin, said they have given permission for a makeshift food court, not any permanent structure.""No permanent structure will be allowed there and we've instructed the contractor to remove the iron structure,"" he said.Rasel explained  they have permitted a design for a movable food van, by consulting with  architect Rafique Azam.DSCC took up a mega project in 2016 during the tenure of former mayor Sayeed Khokon, involving 70 architects to modernise 19 parks and 12 playgrounds including Bahadur Shah park under its jurisdiction.The park was developed under the guidance of Md Rafiq Azam, principal architect of ""Shatto"", an architecture firm and consultant team leader of the mega project and there was no food court in the initial  designs."

Its implementing agency, Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), is now seeking two more years and Tk 5,040 crore more.The proposal for the revised deadline and cost is likely to be placed for approval at today's meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.According to the project documents, the construction was delayed due to a setback in the loan agreement. The import of the machinery related to the factory was also hampered due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Of the project cost, Tk 4,580.21 crore will come from the government funds and the remaining Tk 10,920 crore from foreign loans, including bidders' finance.Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd, Japan and HSBC, Hong Kong are the sources of the loans.The cost of the project is set to rise due to the increase in the expenses for setting up rail and electricity supply lines; hike in loan management, insurance and registration fees; cost escalation for constructing residential buildings as well as for buying chemical goods, lubricants and gas for trial runs.The government took up the project to produce 2,800 tonnes of fertiliser a day, near the existing Urea Fertiliser Factory Limited in Ghorashal and Palash Urea Fertiliser Factory Ltd in Narsingdi.The new factory would be a modern and eco-friendly one, which would replace the two old factories.Currently, the two factories produce 3.15 lakh tonnes of fertiliser annually. The new factory will have an annual production capacity of 9.24 lakh tonnes.Annual domestic production of urea fertiliser varies from seven to 10 lakh tonnes, against the country's annual demand for 25 to 26 lakh.Every year, around 13 to 20 lakh tonnes of urea fertiliser have to be imported.The government took this project in a bid to cut down on import and save foreign currency.The objective was to meet the huge demand deficit of urea and ensure the farmers get the fertiliser at reasonable rates.BCIC officials hope once the granular fertiliser factory goes into operation, the import will be reduced by up to 56 percent, and the country won't have to import urea fertiliser from 2025."

/news/world/2022-russian-invasion-ukraine/news/putin-retaliates-strikes-ukraine-cities-3139441,"Putin retaliates, strikes  Ukraine cities","Russia launched its most widespread air strikes since the start of the Ukraine war yesterday, raining cruise missiles on busy cities during rush hour and knocking out power and heat, in what President Vladimir Putin called revenge for a blown up bridge.Missiles tore into busy intersections, parks and tourist sites in the centre of the capital Kyiv.Explosions were reported in Lviv, Ternopil and Zhytomyr in western Ukraine, Dnipro and Kremenchuk in central Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia in the south and Kharkiv in the east. Ukrainian officials said at least 11 people were killed and dozens injured, and swathes of the country left without power.Germany said a building housing its consulate in Kyiv had been hit in the strike, though it had not been used since the war started.Thousands of residents raced to bomb shelters as air raid sirens rang out through the day. The barrage of dozens of cruise missiles fired from air, land and sea was the biggest wave of air strikes to hit locations away from the front line, at least since the initial volleys on the war's first day, February 24.""The Kyiv regime, with its actions, has put itself on the same level as international terrorist organisations. With the most odious groups. To leave such acts without a response is simply impossible,"" Putin said in a televised address.The Russian leader said he had ordered ""massive"" long range strikes and he threatened more strikes in future if Ukraine hits Russian territory. ""If attempts at terrorist attacks continue, the response from Russia will be severe,"" he said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks were deliberately timed to kill people, as well as to knock out Ukraine's power grid. His prime minister said 11 major infrastructure targets were hit in eight regions, leaving swaths of the country with no electricity, water or heat.""They are trying to destroy us and wipe us off the face of the earth,"" Zelensky said.The European Union condemned yesterday's ""barbaric and cowardly attacks"" on Ukraine, among a chorus of denunciations from Western countries, reports Reuters. UN chief Antonio Guterres condemned Russia for launching a barrage of fatal bombardments across Ukraine, describing it as an ""unacceptable escalation of the war,"" his spokesman said.The Kremlin was humiliated two days ago when a blast damaged Europe's longest bridge, which it had built after it seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. Ukraine, which views the bridge as a military target sustaining Russia's war effort, celebrated the blast without officially claiming responsibility.With troops suffering weeks of setbacks on the battlefield, Russian authorities have been facing the first sustained public criticism at home of the war, with commentators on state television demanding ever tougher measures.Ben Hodges, a former commander of US army forces in Europe, said the scale of the strikes suggested Russia's plan to escalate may have been drawn up before the bridge was attacked.Yesterday's strikes tore a huge crater next to a children's playground in one of central Kyiv's busiest parks. The remains of an apparent missile were buried, smoking in the mud.More volleys of missiles struck the capital again later in the morning. Pedestrians huddled for shelter at the entrance of Metro stations and inside parking garages.By mid-morning, Ukraine's defence ministry said Russia had fired 81 cruise missiles, and Ukraine's air defences had shot down 43 of them. Russia's defence ministry said it had hit all its intended targets.In another sign of possible escalation, Putin's closest ally, President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, said yesterday he had ordered troops to deploy jointly with Russian forces near Ukraine, which he accused of planning attacks on Belarus with its Western backers.""Their owners are pushing them to start a war against Belarus to drag us there,"" he said, citing no evidence. Lukashenko allowed Belarus to be used as a staging ground for Russia early in the war but has not sent his troops to fight.Russia has faced major setbacks on the battlefield since the start of September, with Ukrainian forces bursting through front lines and recapturing territory. Putin responded to the losses by ordering a mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists, proclaiming the annexation of occupied territory and threatening repeatedly to use nuclear weapons."
/sports/news/the-shakib-liton-batting-order-conundrum-3139376,The Shakib-Liton batting order conundrum,"Bangladesh's batting order and their overall batting plan in the T20I format continue to flummox, with Liton Das and skipper Shakib Al Hasan's batting positions an area which negates Bangladesh's advantage as a batting unit heading into the T20I World Cup in Australia.""Unless you're a born opener, No. 3 is the best place to bat. If you don't have Bill Lawry and Bob Simpson or Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes -- a highly successful opening partnership -- preceding you, you have the opportunity to establish the pattern of play. You walk out to bat at your own pace and, apart from when there is an immediate setback, you will have had a chance to quickly assess from the pavilion how the pitch is playing,"" Ian Chappell, the former Australia captain known for his aggressive and resourceful cricket, wrote in a column for ESPNCricinfo in 2015.While Chappell was not of the opinion that the best batter should bat at number three and the fact that he was referring to Test cricket, however, when it comes to T20Is, the context of what your batting line-up combines into will dictate who can bat at number three. Bangladesh think-tank must get out of the rote idea of just focusing on left and right-handed batting combinations and matchups, which risk the Tigers falling further behind, given the profiles they possess.Chappell's column holds weight when it comes to the discussion around Shakib's position and therefore, to a certain extent, Liton's as well.Bangladesh do have their best batter at number three in Liton but it takes away a major advantage of having him in the side. Liton's early career shows that the Powerplay can be about the carnage and acceleration he can provide. Given the available profiles in the current batting order, there are players who can negotiate the middle overs meaningfully. And if Liton carries on, he can still anchor the innings as an opener.Bangladesh's experiment with two make-shift openers have failed to an extent and Sabbir Rahman was dropped in favour of Najmul Hossain Shanto in the last tri-nation series match against hosts New Zealand on Sunday. Liton anchoring is not a bad thing but when you take away the number of deliveries he can face in the Powerplay, the lack of aggression in that 'impact' cricket that technical consultant Sridharan Sriram wants Bangladesh to embrace, becomes apparent.Moreover, there is an obvious technical deficiency in Mehedi Miraz, which also negates the impact that an opener is expected to create in T20Is.Shakib, on the other hand, came into bat at number seven in the New Zealand match. While Afif Hossain's number four position has merit, but by taking away number of deliveries Liton and Shakib can play in an innings reduces much of their impact.Shakib's 2019 World Cup campaign, albeit in ODI format, shows his ability at the number three spot. One BCB director recently told this reporter how the left-hander had to be convinced to take the spot as he can dictate more from that position.Shakib can either now choose to open and let Liton continue where he is or take the number three slot, a position from where he can 'establish the pattern of play' that Chappel insisted on.Shakib has batted at number four in the recently concluded Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and batted at number three in Bangladesh' last tour of West Indies. It was Shakib himself who said after the New Zealand game that the 'top three must raise their hands up and bat till 15th or 16th over.' And now as the skipper, he has the opportunity to do that and raise competitive advantage heading to the World Cup, and the Bangladesh think-tank can begin again from the game against New Zealand tomorrow."
/opinion/editorial/news/addressing-extremism-continuous-process-3140091,Addressing extremism is a continuous process,"It is alarming to note that a number of young men have come under the Rab's radar for their alleged involvement in militant activities on our soil. According to Rab, at least 55 young men who left their homes in the last two years are currently training to make explosives in remote hilly areas and carrying out activities of a new terror outfit with support from one or two ""separatist"" groups. Although many of the details about them are still unclear, this revelation should serve as another warning to us as a nation, and to the authorities in particular, that extremism is far from being defeated in the country.After the horrific Holey Artisan attack, our counterterrorism forces have done a commendable job in preventing any further major terror attacks. Even though we have been successful in tackling militancy through the hard approach, there is much more work that needs to be done to tackle radicalisation in society through different soft approaches. The fact that more young people are getting radicalised is a testament to our failure in that regard.Additionally, it is important for religious leaders and scholars to come forward, and enlighten the youth about the true messages of different religions – none of which condone violence against innocents. To avoid these subjects altogether, and leave them to be discussed by extremists alone would be a great mistake.
Militancy cannot be defeated simply through the use of greater firepower and force. Therefore, it is imperative for us to identify how and why young people are being radicalised, and by whom. Why are our youth getting alienated from society and their fellow citizens? Why are they leaning towards extremist ideologies? Why are more and more young people getting involved in one form of violence or another? These are questions that we must first find the answers to.



Needless to say, the absence of social and economic justice and basic dignity provides a fertile ground for extremists to exploit. Thus, while it is important for our counterterrorism forces to identify the masterminds who are providing the funds and other materials to radicalise the youth, we must all take action to ensure the restoration of justice, dignity and a form of social harmony and cooperation in society, which would be the anchor around which the youth can form their own individual identities.

""We are now waiting for signing of an MoU between Bangladesh and China. Only then, we will begin the work.""Earlier, the ambassador visited Dalia Barrage of Teesta Irrigation Project and Rangpur-Dhaka four-lane highway on Sunday.Asked about it, Md Mizanur Rahman, executive engineer of Water Development Board in Lalmonirhat, said under a preliminary MoU signed in 2016, a Chinese company conducted a feasibility study on the Teesta project.In July 2020, the Ministry of Water Resources sought a $983 million loan from China to implement the ""Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project"", in a letter to Bangladesh's Economic Relations Division. The Bangladesh government will bear 15 percent of the total project cost (about $130 million) and the rest will be a Chinese loan.Mizanur said there has been no final decision made. Against this backdrop, the Chinese ambassador went to visit the Teesta river and talked to the locals and officials concerned.""The Chinese ambassador seemed positive,"" Mizanur told The Daily Star last night.Most of the 111,000 hectares of irrigable land in the Teesta basin in Bangladesh cannot be cultivated during dry season. In 2013-14, only 35 percent of the total irrigable area was cultivated, according to officials concerned.Asked about it, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said the ministry has not received any proposal about the Teesta project. He said after the recurrent floods in 1988 in 1989, a French team conducted a study on the Teesta river management project but Bangladesh had no money to undertake such a project."

/entertainment/tv-film/news/remembering-the-freedom-fighter-turned-filmmaker-chashi-nazrul-islam-3139726,"Remembering the freedom fighter turned filmmaker, Chashi Nazrul Islam ","Can you imagine Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a movie? That is exactly what happened in 1973, on the set of the movie ""Sangram"". The man behind this unimaginable feat was one of the finest directors of Bangladesh, Chashi Nazrul Islam.Today would have been the 81st birthday of the legend.Chashi Nazrul Islam began his career with an office job. On the side, he was a part of the theatre organisation ""Krishti Sangha"". Soon, he would begin working on radio programmes, getting his big breakthrough in the year 1964, getting an opportunity to assist Director Obaidul Huq on ""Dui Diganta"".However, the feature film that made Chashi Nazrul Islam immortal was ""Ora Egaro Jon""— the first Bangladeshi movie to be released after the independence. Being a freedom fighter himself, Islam based this movie on the Liberation War of Bangladesh.The lead actor of this historical drama, Kamrul Alam Khan Khosru, was a freedom fighter as well. The movie aptly captured the turmoil that the Liberation War brought into the personal lives of people, the psychological and material loss they endured, and the desire for independence sprouting in the Bangladeshis.So successful was this movie, that it blurred the lines of fiction and reality in the minds of its audience, being synonymous to the spirit of our independence.The patriotic spirit he kindled was reflected in his other films as well. ""Sangram"", the movie which featured the cameo of Bangabandhu, is based on a plot where Bengali officers within the Pakistani army revolted against the regime. Here, too, the plotlines are inspired from real-life events. It introduces the audience with the inner lives of the brave fighters who risked everything to earn our freedom.The last scene of ""Sangram"" shows the Bangladesh Army honouring Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Islam wanted Bangabandhu to represent himself in the movie, so he, along with Khosru—who was also in the film—visited Bangabandhu to request him to be in the movie.Bangabandhu initially declined the offer. However, upon the persuasion of Abdul Mannan, he eventually agreed. The influence and status of Chashi Nazrul Islam, and the regard everyone held for him, is very evident from this incident.The themes in Islam's movies were wide ranging. But his patriotic movies are the ones that the audiences loved the most. ""Padma Meghna Jamuna"", ""Dhrubo Tara"", ""Megher Pore Megh"" and ""Hangor Nodi Grenade"", are some of the iconic films created by Islam. These movies are etched deeply into the public imagination, and are noted as some of the best works done on Bangladesh's Liberation War.Islam was also very apt in capturing the folk myths on screen. ""Behula Lakhindor"" and ""Hason Raja"" are still very relevant to the Bangladeshi mystical tradition. He was a maestro at blending audience's demands with creative genius. Islam also rarely hesitated to portray melodrama, as per the demands of the plot, but was also cautious to never overdo it.His movies ""Shasti"", "" Shubha"", and ""Devdas"", showcased his skills in capturing legendary literature on camera. Despite the utmost popularity of these original literary works, Islam never disappointed his fans. His portrayals only pumped up the existing love for these characters and stories.Islam was extremely progressive in movie making, never hesitating to depict the dynamics of true human nature. His portrayal of womanhood, and the social confinement women endure in the context of our culture, are indeed unparalleled. The duality of village life, absurdities of superstitions, as well as the open-minded views of religion, was beautifully captured by him.Chashi Nazrul Islam, the man who made Bangabandhu act in a film, was truly an unmatched gem in the history of Bangladeshi cinema. Happy birthday maestro!"

/opinion/views/news/smartphone-addiction-children-how-are-parents-responsible-it-3139896,Smartphone addiction in children: How are parents responsible for it?,"Addiction to digital devices, particularly mobile phones, has been a grave concern in recent years. Everyone, from children to older people, cannot think of spending a moment without electronic gadgets – be it for playing games, watching movies, or scrolling through social media feeds. People nowadays are suffering from a condition called ""nomophobia,"" or the fear of being without one's cell phone.Recently, I returned home from work to find my whole family using their respective mobile phones while sitting on a bed together.After a while, I joined them. My sister spoke to me briefly, but we did not have any eye contact while talking. I believe this is the typical daily case for most of us. However, we rarely even think too much about it. Even those who care seem not to pay attention to these issues within their own lives. We often blame our children for being addicted to mobile phones, but what about us? What are we doing differently? It is up to adults to start spending less time looking at screens at home. When my nephew sees me reading books or writing something, though he cannot read or write, he still gets out a pen and paper for himself. He draws whatever he likes, but at least he does not use mobile devices. So, if we want our children not to use mobile phones excessively, we should stop doing it first. In most cases, parents' obsession with mobile phones affects children directly, causing secondhand obsession. Again, it may expose technology-based interruptions in parent-child interactions.It has been a common scenario that we first introduce mobile phones to our children, so they do not irritate us when we are otherwise engaged. We do so to distract them while they eat as well, to avoid any fussy behaviour. Hence, children become addicted to mobile phones. Essentially, we do not want to spend much time with our children, which results in addiction to mobile phones. However, while blaming our children for it, do we ever realise that we are responsible for it? The earlier we recognise our faults, the faster a solution will come about. According to a World Health Organization recommendation, a digital gadget, mobile phone, laptop, or phone should never be within the reach of a child younger than one-year-old. Children between ages two and five could use their phones for one hour daily. But, let alone following the guidelines of the WHO, it is more concerning how most of us don't even know about them. The research also found that most parents do not bother at all to halt the growing habit of their children of using smartphones. In many cases, they are happy to see their children's different abilities when using a smartphone. Most parents do not find anything wrong with this preoccupation with technology and social media and go on to ignore the harmful effects of too much screen time on their kids. So, before claiming that the situation is out of control and that children are bound to be addicted to mobile devices, we must consider what effective interventions we are taking to end this addiction. Md Sohrab Hossen is senior research assistant at Brac James P Grant School of Public Health, Brac University.

/business/economy/news/bangladesh-japan-trade-cross-20b-2030-3139516,Bangladesh-Japan trade to cross $20b by 2030,"Bilateral trade between Bangladesh and Japan will reach $20 billion by 2030 from more than $3 billion at present as apparel shipments to the far eastern country are rising fast, according to Ito Naoki, Japan's ambassador to Bangladesh.Garment exports from Bangladesh to Japan totalled $1.10 billion in the last fiscal year and it is expected that shipments will rise 10-fold to reach $10 billion by 2030, Naoki said.At the same time, Bangladesh's imports from Japan will increase five-fold to reach $10 billion and as such, the bilateral trade volume will cross $20 billion, indicating growth in recent years.For instance, the number of Japanese companies in Bangladesh tripled over the last 10 years to hit 338 in 2022, and most of them are desperate to expand their business in the country.Naoki was speaking at the 17th annual general meeting of the Japan-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JBCCI) at Lakeshore Hotel in Dhaka yesterday.Most companies conducting bilateral trade between Bangladesh and Japan want the two nations to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) to retain duty privileges even after the former graduates from a least developed country in 2026.However, Bangladesh needs to improve the business climate for signing an FTA, preferential trade agreement or economic partnership agreement with Japan, he said.Moreover, the country needs to improve its investment climate by reforming the tax regime and removing disparities in cash incentives afforded to foreign and domestic companies to attract Japanese companies.A lot of Japanese companies have been relocating their business to other countries from Japan and China, Naoki added.The Japanese ambassador went on to say that bilateral relations between his country and Bangladesh are ever growing. For instance, the Japanese Special Economic Zone at Araihazar upazila in Nayaranganj will be best in Asia in terms of facilities, infrastructure, labour and industrial relations, and business environment.Moreover, from today any individual from Bangladesh can travel to Japan for visiting purposes as the travel rules have been eased. Earlier, Bangladeshis were only allowed to visit Japan in groups.So, a direct flight between Dhaka and Narita in Japan is expected by Bangladeshi airlines soon, he said.The Japan developed Matarbari Deep Seaport is expected to be operational by 2026 under Japan's Big B plan, which will improve trade and investment in Bangladesh.Line six of the Dhaka Metrorail is also expected to open up by December this year and the construction of a third terminal at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka will be completed by December next year, he added.Naoki sought the government's cooperation for establishing the proposed management and technology centre for training skilled manpower at Purbachal town in Dhaka to fill up the gap of trained human resources.Regarding the migration of skilled manpower from Bangladesh to Japan, Naoki said Bangladeshis would have the opportunity to go to Japan and work in the caregiving sector by April next year.Naoki then said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit Japan by the end of next month to boost bilateral relations, which will be helpful for attracting more Japanese investment to the country."

Of the Rs 15.75 crore, sources from the state Information and Cultural Affairs Department said that over Rs 1.20 crore had been scheduled for the gala inauguration event on December 15.A department official said that in the last two years the event was a toned-down affair because of the Covid-19 pandemic fear. ""So, this year the ChiefThe KIFF started in 1995 during the then Left Front regime when Marxist patriarch, Jyoti Basu was the Chief Minister. However, at that point in time, the event had an attraction mainly intellectual film buffs who had inclinations toward parallel movies rather than mainstream cinema.The entire event, including the inauguration ceremony at Kolkata's cultural hub of Nandan was a low-key affair, with the budget behind the expenditure hardly crossing even Rs 50 lakh ever during the Left Front regime.However, after the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government came to power in May 2011, the event was given a different shape and look and was also opened to the masses. The venue of the inauguration ceremony was shifted from Nandan to Netaji Indoor Stadium to accommodate a larger audience.Megastars and superstars from Bollywood like Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan among others became faces of the inauguration ceremony and gala cultural events had always been part of the inauguration ceremony since then. Naturally, in line of the changing face of the event, the expenditure behind it also increased over the years to reach this year's budgeted figure of around Rs 16 crore."

/opinion/editorial/news/food-court-the-cost-heritage-3140116,Food court at the cost of heritage?,"The Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) has reportedly taken it upon itself to construct a food court inside the historical Bahadur Shah Park of Old Dhaka. This park houses two memorials – one of them in honour of those martyred during the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. And currently, it is one of the only open spaces wherein the old and young residents of Old Dhaka can get some respite and reconnect with nature. Yet, rather than preserving such a rare space of greenery, which also is part of Dhaka's hundreds of years of heritage, the city corporation itself is attempting to ruin the park's sanctity. Already, a metal structure has been erected in the park, taking up space that should be reserved for visitors. What's more surprising is that all this is being done despite adamant protests from citizens. So, given that those who actually frequent the park do not want a food court there, whose good is it being built for? Is it just a way for city authorities to pocket some profit? Do they realise that not every bit of land needs to be profitable in order to be deemed useful? It is disappointing that ruining heritage sites has become a fad for our authorities as of late. In Old Dhaka itself, ancient structures such as Bara Katra and Choto Katra are facing demolition. Earlier this year, Tetultala playground in Kalabagan had to be saved by locals from the police, who wanted to construct a police station there. Even Suhrawardy Udyan, a witness to so many crucial moments of Bangladesh's birth and early years, faced the threat of a food court last year. Often, it is seen that those heritage sites which are being destroyed belong to the High Court's 2018 list of 2,200 buildings which it directed Rajuk to preserve. In fact, the Bahadur Shah Park itself has a place in that list. Are we to believe that, for our city authorities, so-called development is above the wishes of citizens and even above the law? In the case of the food court being constructed in Bahadur Shah Park, the chief estate officer of DSCC told this newspaper that they had only allowed for the setting up of ""a movable food van"" in the park, and that they have already ""instructed the contractor to remove the iron structure."" We hope the DSCC representative's assurance that ""no permanent structure will be allowed"" to be built in Bahadur Shah Park is something we can rely on. It is high time for government authorities to ensure that ""development"" does not get in the way of heritage, and for them to stop behaving as if the opposite is the case. Citizens care about historical structures and greenery – and authorities need to do the same."
/business/news/trading-govt-bonds-takes-place-3140106,Trading of govt bonds takes place,"The trading of treasury bonds and bills took place on the stock exchanges of Bangladesh today, a day after their debut.There are about 270 treasury bonds worth more than Tk 2.5 lakh crore with their tenures ranging from two years to 20 years, data from the Bangladesh Bank showed.Of them, 222 treasury bonds were listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) as of August, with a combined value of Tk 59,359 crore. But they were not traded like shares and mutual fund units and they could be bought and sold only over the counter.But it changed for the better on Monday as the BSEC allowed treasury bills and bonds to be traded like stocks and mutual fund units, albeit on a trial basis.No items, however, could change hands on the exchanges because of a technical glitch on the day. Data migration could not be completed on time so trading was not possible although there were some buy orders, said the DSE.But several treasury bonds were traded on the DSE and the Chittagong Stock Exchange yesterday.Thanks to the commencement of the trading of government securities, Bangladesh has taken a major leap forward by making them easily available to investors through the exchanges and diversifying the product base.However, the lot of the bonds is 1,000 with a face value of Tk 100 means investors need to pay at least Tk 1 lakh or above to buy a single set of securities. As a result, small investors did not show much interest in buying them.While stocks are ownership in a company, bonds are a loan to a company or government. Because they are a loan, with a set interest payment, a maturity date, and a face value that the borrower will repay, they tend to be far less volatile than stocks."

The session could reveal whether Russia's international isolation is growing as its war grinds on.""The UN Charter is clear: Any annexation of a state's territory by another state resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the principles of the UN Charter and international law,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said September 29, a day ahead of a theatrical Kremlin ceremony to incorporate the territories into Russia.Guterres said any attempt to annex Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia would have ""no legal value"" and would be a ""dangerous escalation.""The following day, Russia exercised its veto in the UN Security Council to block a resolution condemning its actions. That has spurred a move to the General Assembly, where no state has a veto.In addition to the debate, countries will be asked to state their stance on the issue by voting on a European-drafted resolution condemning Russia's move to annex Ukrainian territory.""It is clinically focused on the legality or illegality of what Russia is doing,"" European Union Ambassador Olof Skoog told reporters of the draft text.The final draft, seen by VOA on Friday, reiterates the secretary-general's pronouncement and reaffirms states' commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.It also clearly condemns Russia's ""illegal so-called referenda"" and ""attempted illegal annexation"" and says they are invalid under international law."

/opinion/views/news/mermaids-arent-real-and-neither-race-3140096,"Mermaids aren’t real, and neither is race","A recent tweet explained the often-elusive difference between science fiction and fantasy: ""Fantasy is when Black people are told they're historically inaccurate, sci-fi is when Black people are told 'it's woke garbage' they exist.""The concept of race in speculative fiction comes up in media discourse whenever someone in some well-known media franchise turns up with a crumb of melanin. It is a debate that is particularly frustrating, because like most issues of the 21st century, it requires an exhausting amount of nuance and analysis while simultaneously being incredibly stupid.We've had Black stormtroopers (Star Wars, not the Sturmabteilung, though there is that one Key & Peele sketch), who apparently couldn't exist because of (a worryingly racist reason). The casting of people of colour in Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher was derided because of (a worryingly racist reason). Black women cannot exterminate ghosts because of (a worryingly racist reason). And over the past few months, it's been Black elves, Black dwarves, Black Targaryens, and now Black mermaids can't exist because of (you get the idea).Why not a Black mermaid? Because Hans Christian Andersen was a White guy? Disney, a multibillion-dollar corporation with a vice grip on global entertainment, is not making a loving homage to 19th century Danish culture. (Nor, I suspect, are people who are mad about Black mermaids particularly interested in 19th century Danish culture or the sanctity of Andersen's body of work.) Disney has no in-text reason to not cast people of colour in whatever role. We are at a point in our history, thankfully, where denying roles to actors of colour is recognised as racial discrimination. Meanwhile, House of the Dragon's prominent change of characters to black and mixed race is not merely colourblind, but in fact adds to the plot. The show still largely has a White cast, but its decision to show the existence of racial diversity in Fantasy Europe has been treated as ""historically inaccurate.""There is a point to this: Westeros is not real, but it does represent a vision of Europe, and so we can expect the people within its world to look European. Of course, if you look at Europe, you'll find Bangladeshis running gulyás éttermek in Budapest, even though Viktor Orban told me Hungary is for white people. But historically, right?Black and Brown people are ""historically accurate"" to any fantastical rendering of Europe. The imagination of medieval Europe that serves as the template for your bog-standard fantasy setting is White, because Europe has historically been imagined to be White, as a project to imagine the presence of supposedly non-White bodies as interlopers, outsiders, people who do not belong. Even if the faulty imagination of a ""White Europe"" were true (it is, to reiterate, not true), the modern Western world that generates the bulk of our entertainment is demonstrably not a White world, and to insist on a performance of Whiteness in the media where the diversity underlying the real world is erased cannot be justified except by (a worryingly racist reason).Let's go deeper. Are elves, Targaryens and mermaids White? No. Because elves, Targaryens, mermaids and White people don't exist in the real world.Race itself is not real. Race is the idea that humanity can be sorted into discrete groups with unique behavioural and intellectual characteristics, largely corresponding with physiological differences and similarities between potentially related groups of people. The ways in which these physical characteristics dictate identity and culture are fantasies, and our current conceptualisation of race derives heavily from the last couple centuries of European imperialism, and from the dominance of American media. Race is one of the most important concepts underlying modern social relations while simultaneously completely fictional.This means that while there are no mermaids in real life, the skin tone we ascribe to the mermaid's human half is a legitimate battleground for how we view race. Speculative fiction has long held what Helen Young called ""Habits of Whiteness."" We live in a world that continues to be dominated by a former imperial core, whose self-declared rightful inhabitants in turn self-declared as ""White,"" and their viewpoint continues to dictate the shape of the world through global culture. It is a viewpoint that centralises Whiteness as the normal. Speculative fiction has its roots in genre conventions established by writers who hailed from an era of explicit imperialism (rather than the more genteel liberal capitalism of today). JRR Tolkien, we can very safely say, never imagined the existence of a Black elf. He was a White supremacist. Though he was no Lovecraft, who wrote primarily to express race anxiety, race as hierarchy is intrinsic to Tolkien's worldbuilding.Let's circle back. As elves aren't real, they can be Black. In the context of a Tolkien adaptation, however, skin colour matters. The canonical Whiteness of elves isn't just the default assumption of a writer imagining Ye Olde England as a supermarket mayonnaise aisle. It is thematically consistent with Tolkien's view of racial hierarchy. In Tolkien's legendarium, elves are White for a reason: because he wanted to represent a superior form of life. What elves are to the Men of Numenor (the Men of the West), Numenoreans are to the other categories of men, and then on down to the orcs et al. Sentient life is sorted into racial categories of greater and lesser worth. The parallels are not coincidental. Tolkien famously despised allegory, but everyone writes an allegory whether they want to or not. Just as racial hierarchy was not incidental to the world in which Tolkien lived, it was not incidental to the world he invented.Should a Tolkien elf only be played by a White actor? No. However, a better show than The Rings of Power might have had something insightful to say about race through the casting of Black actors in roles that were, in the original, expressions of White supremacist race hierarchy. Instead, The Rings of Power represents yet another sort of fantasy: a world where anyone anywhere can look like anything, and you don't need to think about it too much. This sort of fantasy of diversity would certainly feel less cynical if it were not being beamed at us by Amazon.The fantasy of racial diversity that Amazon and Disney relay relies on a lack of history, where we have no politics or opinions that trouble a society making money for our bosses. Race is a fiction, but its pages are burnt and bloody. Race matters. The politics of the representation of this fantasy in fields of make-believe are not clear-cut, the stories we appear in are often written with the subtext of our exclusion, and our increasing presence on the screen (rather than just consuming content) cannot be to passively legitimise anodyne projects of racist capitalism. Zoheb Mashiur is a doctoral researcher on racial discourse and colonial history, based at the University of Kent.

/entertainment/tv-film/news/3-movies-and-2-shows-watch-following-world-mental-health-day-3140181,3 movies and 2 shows to watch following World Mental Health Day,"Yesterday marked the occasion of World Mental Health Day. With growing awareness regarding the importance of mental health, it has become a key ingredient for the plotline of a variety of media.These stories not only help normalise such issues, but also act as brilliant sources of representation.So, with that in mind, here are five such shows and films that you can binge, following World Mental Health Day.Atypical
""Atypical"" is a Netflix original series about an 18-year-old American high school student, who has been diagnosed on the autism spectrum—a neurodevelopmental disease characterised by confined, repetitive behaviours and social communication problems.The show takes us through the life of Sam, brilliantly capturing the diversity of the autism spectrum. While it addresses heavier themes like grief and interpersonal conflict, it blends all these themes within lighter layers of honesty, humour, and warmth.The show not only focuses on Sam as an individual, but also his family members and loved ones as the plot leaves behind subtle questions regarding what is actually considered normal.Normal People
""Normal People"" covers several important themes, including grief, loneliness, and mental health. It has been critically acclaimed for its realistic depiction of men's mental health difficulties, something which is usually not discussed in mainstream media.While general loneliness pervades the series, the last few episodes highlight the challenges of living with mental issues. It does not undermine or exaggerate the conditions, and while it moves away from the narrative that a depressed person is supposed to stay isolated, it hints at the finer elements like the lack of energy to carry out every day mundane tasks.All the Bright Places
This show is a popular young-adult film, which explores the lives of two teenagers struggling with their individual, yet complex, issues. While Violet suffers from depression rooting from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Finch is haunted with an unnamed mental illness that has symptoms similar to bipolar disorder.Although the film does not explicitly address mental illness, it skilfully depicts how solitary, tiring and tough it can be to live with any form of mental health issue. ""All the Bright Places"" also emphasises the importance of discussing mental health, and carrying out important conversations before it's too late.The Perks of being a Wallflower
Directed by Stephen Chbosky, the plot of this film revolves around Charlie, a high school student who is haunted by past traumas, following the suicide of his friend.As the story continues, tales of childhood abuse are unveiled and he finds it extremely difficult to move on. ""The Perks of being a Wallflower"" presents a rather relatable story, with the familiar element of bottling up of emotions. The film received a lot of love from the audience, due to the strength displayed by the protagonist and the use of literature throughout the healing process.  Silver Linings Playbook
This popular film follows a person diagnosed with bipolar disorder, as he seeks treatment and recovers from an event caused by a manic episode. The main character's reluctance to acknowledge his mistakes adds to the truth of his diagnosis and the overall portrayal of his character.
At its core, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a love story, that also illustrates the smaller and more everyday ways in which mental health may affect a person's life. What makes this film critically acclaimed is the honest character development, coupled with truthful depictions of the disorder.

/opinion/views/news/big-tech-and-our-right-know-3140071,Big Tech and our right to know,"The world observed International Day for Universal Access to Information last month, recognising the importance for every individual to be able to access information held by public institutions. Traditionally, it has been an opportunity to examine whether countries have adopted a law on access to information and if, in practice, public bodies adhere to their transparency obligations.At present, 126 countries have access to information laws. This means 91 percent of the world's population can formally request information from a state or local authority.But we know that the right to know doesn't end with the existence of a law. It is a right that empowers people to participate in decisions that affect them, a tool to hold entities that make such decisions accountable. Information is power, as we often say.However, it is not just governments that make those decisions. From the extractive industry to Big Tech, private corporations hold enormous power over individuals, both online and offline.Yet, laws do not make them accountable in the same way that access to information laws do public institutions. They are not obliged to be transparent, and individuals do not have the guarantees that the right to know gives them. So far, only data protection laws have tried to fill this gap, allowing people whose data have been processed by companies to ask how it is being used.Until very recently, the importance of the right to know for corporate transparency has been neglected, or perhaps just ignored. Nowhere is this more visible than on social media.Social media platforms are no longer considered just private companies whose users simply accept terms and conditions. They are spaces where free expression, democratic debate and participation are realised. Given their power, the transparency of Big Tech firms is becoming increasingly important.There is a massive concentration of market power in a handful of companies that have total control over the content that is distributed and consumed: they actively control, select, and censor what we see online. This much power cannot be left unchecked.The European Union (EU) has recently taken a major step towards addressing this issue, by introducing regulations in the digital sphere. The Digital Services Act is meant to ensure that users are able to choose from a wide range of products and services online, while the Digital Markets Act is aimed at allowing businesses to freely and fairly compete online. The European Commission's initiative sets transparent and clear rules for companies, and outlines sanctions if they fail to respect them.Crucially, the legislations put a strong emphasis on transparency, to shed light on issues such as the platforms' content moderation practices. That way, users can operate in a predictable environment and know the possibilities and limits on their behaviour online. Platforms will be required to explain and publish their terms of services, explain their content moderation decisions and make them publicly available.Social media companies will also have to produce transparency reports, including information about requests from governments to remove user-generated content, notices submitted to flag alleged illegal content, and information about measures against misuse. This will benefit researchers, oversight bodies, and the public who will be able to better understand how content moderation decisions are made.But while a law is a key and fundamental step, for it to be effective, it requires implementation on two sides. One, institutions need to know the law well and see it with a positive, instead of a suspicious, attitude. Second, people need to know that a law exists and that they can use it freely to ask for information.The same needs to happen with Big Tech. Companies need to understand how transparency will benefit them in the long run, through building trust with their users and the public at large.It is also crucial that users are informed about their right to know and know how to use it. This two-way awareness of transparency is a long process and we're just getting started. The road ahead is long, but one thing is clear: companies have a duty to respect human rights, and the right to know is one of them.Ilaria Fevola is ARTICLE 19's legal officer focused on transparency.

Shah will also replace Ganguly as India's representative at the all powerful ICC Board.The only Congressman in the BCCI cabinet is Rajeev Shukla, who will continue as vice president. Sports minister Anurag Thakur's younger brother Arun Singh Dhumal will now become IPL chairman. He will replace Brijesh Patel.Influential Maharashtra BJP leader Ashish Shelar will be the new treasurer which means that he won't become Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) president. He was supposed to take up the role with support from Sharad Pawar faction.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's close aide Devajit Saikia will replace Jayesh George as the new joint secretary. Whether BCCI will contest for the ICC chairmanship hasn't been decided as yet.          ""An influential minister in the central government played a key role in deciding the positions in the Board set up,"" a BCCI source told PTI. Binny will officially take charge of BCCI on October 18 at the AGM in Mumbai. There won't be any election to any post as all candidates will be chosen unopposed.The medium pacer was one of the architects of India's historic World Cup triumph in 1983.

/opinion/editorial/news/inspiring-example-leadership-3139731,An inspiring example of leadership,"It is encouraging to learn of the story of a woman whose rise from a background of helplessness to be in a position to help others can be an example for countless people from similar backgrounds. Setara Begum, 37, comes from a small village in Lalmonirhat. And like many girls struggling with poverty and unhelpful social norms, her life, too, seemed headed to a destiny she didn't, or wouldn't, choose. According to a report, while in her eighth grade, Setara dropped out of school because of poverty, and after her father's death, was hurriedly married off. Her husband, known as Shamsu Pagla, was so called because of his mental illness.She helps those in need to access government allowances and services, hears about their problems, and tries to solve them. She is like their ""guardian angel"". For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel. She helps those in need to access government allowances and services, hears about their problems, and tries to solve them. She is like their ""guardian angel"".Life after marriage was no less painful for her, with an ailing husband in constant need of care, their meagre earnings, and no house to call their own. All this would have weighed down any person of lesser strength. But not Setara. She decided to turn her challenges into an advantage, and she had a lifetime of lessons to guide her. She became a candidate for the reserved chair-member post in the Mogholhat union parishad. It was initially ridiculed, but soon she convinced her people with her courage and down-to-earth attitude, and so they financed her campaign. Today, she is a UP member, and a very sincere one at that.Every day, she sets out from her home at dawn, covering at least five villages on foot before the day's end. She helps those in need to access government allowances and services, hears about their problems, and tries to solve them. She is like their ""guardian angel"" who lives among them. With her small honorarium as a UP member and her husband's disability allowance, they live a simple yet richly rewarding life. In a way, her past life of struggle and caregiving set the stage for her eventual role in the service of her community. She remains an inspiration not just for those similarly battered by life, but women with political aspirations as well.In Bangladesh, the road to women's political participation and representation is littered with many obstacles. Only last month, a female Zila Parishad member candidate, while returning from an election campaign, was waylaid by five men and raped at gunpoint. The victim later said, ""They raped me to stop me from competing in the election."" This is just one example of just one kind of obstacle – sexual violence – that politically ambitious women have to face. Other challenges include smear campaigns, lack of support and security, the general preference for tokenism rather than representation, etc. Women are easier to target for political rivals, and we have a society that, for all its talk of equality and inclusion, is still not open to having women in decision-making positions.Setara has shown how women's political empowerment is actually in the best interest of our society. We hope more people will be encouraged by her example."

According to family members, they are aged 18 to 32 while the identities of the rest 17 were still unverified.At the briefing, the Rab said the 55 are from 19 districts and have joined a newly formed militant outfit called ""Jama'atul Ansar Fil Hindal Sharqiya"". Without mentioning any specific insurgent group, officials said separatists provide food supply and shelter to the militants in exchange of money.The Jama'atul Ansar was formed by former members of three home-grown militant organisations -- Harkat-ul-Jihad Bangladesh, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh and Ansar Al Islam, they added.""Under the shelter of one or two separatist groups, the outfit members have been receiving training and running organisational activities from hideouts in remotest areas of the Chattogram Hill Tracts,"" Commander Khandaker Al Moin, director of Rab's Legal and Media Wing, told journalists.At the briefing, Rab said they arrested 12 people, including seven ""missing"" youths, over their involvement with the outfit. After interrogating them, it claimed to have learned about the outfit and the 55 hiding in the hills.Of the 12, five including the outfit's financial aid provider Shah Md Habibullah alias Habib, 32, were arrested during drives in Dhaka's Jatrabari and Keraniganj on Sunday.The four other arrestees are Neyamat Ullah, 43, a teacher at a Cumilla madrasa, Md Hossain, 22, an electrician, Rakib Hasnat alias Niloy, 28, a delivery boy of a courier service provider, and Saiful Islam, 19, a mason.Habibullah's latest occupation was as an imam of Kuba Mosque in Cumilla. For two years before this, he ran a residential madrasa in Naikhongchhari.The man joined the militant outfit in 2020 and so far, he has managed to recruit around 15 to 20 members and send them to training. He used to collect donations under various names and then send the money to the outfit's fund, Commander Moin said.Neyamat joined the outfit in 2019 and he was involved in coordinating and giving shelter to the youths leaving homes to join militancy.Drawn to militancy, Hossain left home a year back, Saiful one and half months back, and Rakib two months back.On October 6, Rab claimed to have arrested seven others, including four ""missing"" youths from Munshiganj, Narayanganj, and Mymensingh.Rab has arrested the seven following information from Shartaz Islam Niloy, 22, who had gone missing from Cumilla on August 23 and returned to his Kolyanpur home on September 1.Commander Moin said this outfit targets youths and radicalises them after showing various videos of the ""persecution of Muslims"" and giving different misinterpretations of Islam.The outfit provides vocational training to its recruits in various fields like carpentry, painting and electrical work to help them run organisational activities under disguise, he added. ""We are now at the primary stage of investigation and we are yet to get any idea about who is leading the newly formed outfit. We are working to find out the top financiers and top leadership. A joint operation is now underway with other agencies in hilly areas to arrest the outfit members."""
/business/economy/news/womens-employment-banks-rises-slightly-3139621,Women’s employment in banks rises slightly,"The rate of employment of women in Bangladesh's banking sector has slightly increased to 16.3 per cent in June this year from 15.2 per cent four years earlier. However, such a meagre development is not expected given the country's impressive economic growth in recent years, opined two female economists.The infrastructural support dedicated for women are not adequate, which has created a major roadblock to strengthening females' participation in banking jobs, they said.A good number of women usually secure appointment letters for jobs but many resign at one point giving priority to household responsibilities.The total number of employees in banks stood at 193,742 as of June this year, of which 31,548 are females, as per data from Bangladesh Bank.The same scenario prevails for entry level banking jobs with females accounting for only 16.86 per cent of the total employees. It was 15.48 per cent in June 2019.Participation of females in the country's overall labour market has got stuck in recent years, said Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue.Females comprise around 36 per cent of the total workforce in the country's employment sector, she said.The ratio has remained almost the same in the last couple of years, she said.Participation of females in the job market had earlier gone up substantially, but the growth has recently decelerated, Khatun said, adding that the lower growth has been reflected in the country's banking sector as well.""It is much difficult for a woman to continue her job in comparison to a man given the responsibilities stemming from households,"" she said.On top of that, the females have to play a pivotal role in rearing children, creating enormous difficulties in preforming their jobs in an efficient manner, she said.The number of daycare centres is still very low than what is required, which is why women face a drastic challenge in undertaking jobs, she said.Sayema Haque Bidisha, a professor of the University of Dhaka's economics department, said the country has managed an impressive economic growth in the last couple of years but the ratio of female participation in the job market has not increased in keeping with the times.In addition, very few women usually get the scope to promote themselves to policymaking levels, she said.In June this year, the percentage of mid to high-level staff was 15.83 per cent and 9.55 per cent respectively in contrast to 15.3 per cent and 8.5 per cent.Working women are facing a lack of several infrastructural facilities, such unavailability of transportation and training centres to improve their skills, Bidisha said. "

Both companies said the service would be expanded next year.But Apple's iPhone models, including the latest iPhone 14, and many of Samsung's premier phones do not have software compatible for supporting 5G in India, according to three industry sources and Airtel's website.Concerned by this, top bureaucrats from India's telecoms and IT departments will chair a meeting on Wednesday for early 5G adoption, asking smartphone executives from foreign companies Apple, Samsung, Vivo and Xiaomi, as well as domestic telecom operators Reliance, Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VODA.NS) to be present, according to a government document seen by Reuters.The agenda includes holding talks ""to prioritise"" and release software upgrades for supporting the high-speed network, the notice for the closed-door meeting stated.Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), Vivo, Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), as well as the three domestic telecom operators, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government's IT and telecom departments also did not respond.India has said that launch of 5G in the world's biggest mobile market - after China - will bring high-speed internet to consumers, with simultaneous socio-economic benefits in sectors like agriculture and health.In August, Jio, India's biggest mobile carrier with more than 420 million customers, snapped up airwaves worth $11 billion in a $19 billion 5G spectrum auction. Airtel spent more than $5 billion, while Vodafone doled out above $2 billion.While telecom players and smartphone companies have been holding discussions with each other, ironing out compatibility issues between the specific 5G technology of telecom companies in India and phone software is taking time, one of the industry sources said.Airtel's website on Tuesday showed ""Apple yet to update software"" for all of Apple iPhones' 12 to 14 models under its 5G compatible section. For Samsung too, many models were not ready, Airtel stated, while more than three dozen models of China's Xiaomi and Vivo were shown as ready for use with its 5G service.""Apple has been taking a lot of time. Airtel has been concerned about this as many of their premium clients are on Apple devices,"" said a second industry source with direct knowledge of the situation, who added Apple and Airtel have been holding talks.A third source with direct knowledge of the issue said Apple was in the process of testing and validating different 5G offerings from network providers in India."

Nigar Sultana's troops will face the UAE in their final league stage game today at the same venue and, given rain doesn't play spoilsport, a win for the Tigresses would see them move to number four in the points table with equal six points as Thailand.However, the Tigresses would progress to the semifinals courtesy of superior run rate."

""Had they found a way I think the world would have had less of a severe crisis.""Ironically Bernanke was the chair of the US Federal Reserve at the time of Lehman's collapse in 2008, which became one of the main catalysts of the world's biggest financial turmoil since the 1930s.Bernanke, now a fellow at the Brooking Institution, argued at the time that there was no legal way to save Lehman so the next best thing was to let it fail and use the government's financial resources to prevent wider systemic failures.Part of that response, including ultra low interest rates and massive central bank asset buys are being reversed now as inflation is at its highest level in around a half a century in many parts of the world.""What Bernanke did was to show that banks played a central role in turning relatively small recessions into the depression in the 30s, and that was the worst economic crisis that the world has seen ever since,"" Professor John Hassler, member of committee for the Nobel Prize for Economics, said.Bank runs can easily become self-fulfilling leading to the collapse of an institution and putting the entire financial sector at risk.""These dangerous dynamics can be prevented through the government providing deposit insurance and acting as a lender of last resort to banks,"" the Academy said.Dybvig, a professor at Washington University in St Louis, and Diamond argued that banks taking short-term deposit and lending this cash out in the long term is the most efficient arrangement.This was a valuable function to society but the arrangement also made them prone to runs. Risks would then be reduced via ""delegated monitoring"" where banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers.This spreads risks and ensures efficiency as banks are better suited to assess creditworthiness and monitor the use of funds, the Academy said.The three economists will receive an equal share of the 10 million Swedish crown ($885,000) prize money.They join such luminaries as Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman, previous winners of the prize. The majority of previous laureates have been from the United States."

It was later made mandatory for availing other services,"" said Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam.Briefing reporters after the meeting, he said as other services are being offered based on the NID, it has now become necessary to keep the NID system under the supervision of the government instead of the EC.""The decision was made to bring the national identity registration under the Security Services Division, [of the home ministry] which deals with passports,"" said the cabinet secretary.The Security Services Division placed the bill before the cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.There are 32 sections in the existing law. However, some of them have been left out of the proposed act, said Anwarul.He said a unique identity will be issued to each citizen. Once the NID job is transferred to the Security Services Division, a unique ID number will be issued to each newborn at the time of birth, which will be their NID numbers, he added.According to the cabinet secretary, it may take another two to three years to start issuing IDs to newborns.He said fingerprints and iris scans will be collected from the newborns for the issuance of NID and those will be updated from time to time.The cabinet yesterday asked the Legislative Division of the law ministry to review the draft law and place it again before the cabinet after adding a few provisions, if needed.Replying to a question, the cabinet secretary said the EC could use the NID of Security Services Division for preparing voter ID cards or it can develop its own mechanism.Anwarul said there will be interoperability between the systems of different government organisations to use NID data from the Security Services Division. ""It will not be open to all… only some selected organisations will get access to the data.""Currently, the Office of the Registrar General, Birth and Death Registration under the Local Government Division issues birth and death certificates.Asked what would happen to the registrar general's office after the NID service job is given to the home ministry, the cabinet secretary said the officials concerned would sit to find a solution.The environment, forest and climate change ministry placed the draft of the National Adaptation Plan (2023-2050) before the cabinet, incorporating 90 high priorities and 23 medium priorities in it to address climate change.But the cabinet sent back the draft saying that it needed changes, said Anwarul.The meeting also approved the draft of a bilateral agreement on direct flight operation between Bangladesh and Brunei.The cabinet endorsed a proposal, placed by the foreign ministry, for Bangladesh's joining the Global Methane Pledge.Anwarul said 50 countries have so far signed the pledge.The Global Methane Pledge is a commitment to take voluntary actions to contribute to a collective effort to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030."

In videos circulated on social media, exchanges of fire could be heard. At the time, Palestinian health officials said two teens, ages 16 and 18, were killed and that 11 people were wounded.The Israeli army said it was ""aware of an allegation regarding injuries to a minor who participated in the violent riots and hurled stones at the security forces.""

The army said it had traced some of the perpetrators of those attacks back to Jenin.Israeli fire has killed more than 100 Palestinians during that time, making it the deadliest year in the occupied territory since 2015.The Israeli military says the vast majority of those killed were militants or stone-throwers who endangered the soldiers. But several civilians have also been killed during Israel's months-long operation, including a veteran journalist and a lawyer who apparently drove unwittingly into a battle zone. Local youths who took to the streets in response to the invasion of their neighborhoods have also been killed.Israel says the arrest raids are meant to dismantle militant networks. The Palestinians say the operations are aimed at strengthening Israel's 55-year military occupation of territories they want for an independent state.Also on Monday, Israeli soldiers entered the Shuafat refugee camp and searched homes and shops for a Palestinian suspected in the killing of an Israeli soldier over the weekend. Dozens of camp residents threw stones at the soldiers who fired tear gas.Saturday night's shooting happened at a checkpoint near the camp in east Jerusalem. Police said at the time that the assailant got out of a car and opened fire, seriously wounding the female soldier and a security guard before running into the camp.

I knew what they wanted from me, I didn't think much. I didn't care what I had to do. The one thing I wanted was to stay here.""Reports in Spain say the 31-year-old agreed to reduce the salary he was earning at Barcelona in order to make his stay permanent.""I will give everything for my club, the trust of the coach, the fans, Atletico,"" continued Griezmann.

This will result in shorter processing time as transactions will be completed near real-time using RTGS instead of multiple days using FCY DD.HSBC is always determined to create opportunities for its clients to avail smooth and convenient services.Thus, with the ever-changing environment, HSBC is continuously introducing new ways of making its customer journey easier through new development and product customisation."

He was an extremely humble and down to earth person, who knew very well how to respect people.

However, the actress has clearly denied these allegations.Now, she has come forward with a post on her official Facebook account, denying the rumours and threatening legal action.The actress' post read:
Since my childhood, I have dreamed of becoming an actress.  Now, I'm going a little further to fulfil that dream of mine. The way people have given me love and embraced me, is something I have always wanted.



However, along with the good, some people are trying to stop me from succeeding. They are doing this by spreading misleading information about me. While I have always focused on my work, without paying any heed to the false information about me, I have recently noticed how these rumours are being created by associating my name with the personal life of another person. 
These rumours are being spread by personal Facebook IDs and through various YouTube videos. I have avoided it from the beginning, because I was not associated with any of this. The only relationship I have with this person is that of a professional one between two artistes.
 



However, I think it is unfair and undesirable that a negative impression is being created about me in the minds of my fans. Personally, I am very upset about this, and it needs to stop.
Some of those who are spreading these rumours are doing this from positions of power. They are spreading false rumours about me without fact-checking my statements. I want to make it clear that, keeping the prevailing laws in my mind, I will be compelled to take strict and legal action if this continues—because I respect the law. I pray for everyone's blessings, and hope that everyone's well-being and good sense prevails.

In the end, defender Ashraful Islam, goalkeeper Biplob Kujur, defender Rezaul Karim Babu, midfielder Sohanur Rahman Sabuj, forward Rasel Mahmud Jimmy and midfielder Roman Sarker were picked as the icon players by the participating teams, who confirmed them in line with the teams' plan.The coaches of all participating teams admitted no team is tipped as favourites, especially after the way the players have been distributed. The teams had been given the list of drafted players -- consisting of 187 local and 24 foreign players -- and yesterday, the teams picked 78 local players and 24 foreign players to form their respective squads based on lottery.

/opinion/editorial/news/hospital-life-support-3139746,A Hospital on Life Support,"It is extremely disheartening that Pabna Mental Hospital, the oldest such facility in the country, remains in a terrible shape. The 500-bed state-run hospital has been struggling to provide patients with the most basic of requirements including nutritious meals, prescribed medication, and specialised treatment. And as per families of former patients, the standard of its medical care is not good enough to ensure that patients receiving treatment there would fully recover.Things had, in fact, gotten so bad that, in early September, the then acting director of the hospital issued an order to stop admitting new patients, citing a supply shortage of food, medicine, and other necessities. Although the order was withdrawn a day later, after the health directorate assured that it would provide the necessary support, things have not improved much.According to a report by this newspaper, the main reasons behind the hospital's dismal condition are the presence of an unscrupulous contractor syndicate responsible for food and medicine supply, a lack of specialist doctors, and the pervasive interference of brokers. While the hospital is supposed to follow a diet plan which includes meat and vegetables, patients have alleged that its food quality is substandard. In fact, the food quality is so poor that a large amount of food has to be dumped as patients cannot eat it. And this has largely been happening as the syndicate of unscrupulous contractors has been consistently getting their work order using their influence. They reportedly embezzle money by supplying subpar food and inadequate medicine. When the hospital decided to make changes to the traditional tendering process to break up the syndicate, one of the companies involved filed a lawsuit, which has further disrupted the supply of food and medicine.Additionally, the facility also lacks provisions for advanced care due to an acute shortage of specialised doctors and other hospital staff. Of the 31 posts of doctors, only 10 are currently occupied. And out of the 643 positions at the hospital, 176 are presently vacant. With such a huge manpower shortage, it is not possible for the facility to provide quality treatment.Under the circumstances, the health authorities need to take a long and hard look at themselves. Surely things have not come to this point in a day or two, but rather over a prolonged period, thanks to their negligence. The fact that mental health patients have so few options for treatment in our country – and that the country's oldest mental health institute is in such shambles – speaks volumes about their terrible performance. And for that, the government must hold the relevant authorities to account. Moreover, the government should immediately provide the Pabna Mental Hospital with all necessary funding and support to get it back on its feet, so it can provide quality care to mental health patients."

Later, the government informed about the subsidy of Tk 17,000 crore,"" he added.According to law, the price of electricity should be announced within 90 working days.Earlier on Sunday, BERC Chairman Abdul Jalil had said that the announcement of increasing the price of electricity could come any day.At a virtual press conference that day, the BERC chairman said, ""We will announce the price within the stipulated time. A judgment of 50-60 pages, every word has to be seen. It's taking some time for that.

The noise you hear right after the scream in the theatre is a laugh, and once the audience is laughing, if you've been trying to create tension and foreboding, that's gone,"" he told media outlet The Wrap in an article published on Saturday.""We had 21 jump scares in (The Midnight Club's first episode), I don't think it made the episode scarier at all,"" he added.The Midnight Club stars Friday Night Lights' (2006 to 2011) Zach Gilford alongside a cast of teenagers, including Iman Benson. It is based on the 1994 Christopher Pike novel of the same name, and is set in a hospice for terminally ill young people."

/news/asia/india/news/india-inflation-likely-hit-5-month-high-sept-surging-food-prices-3140196,India inflation likely hit 5-month high in Sept on surging food prices,"India's retail inflation accelerated to a five month high of 7.30% in September due to surging food prices, staying well above the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) upper tolerance band for a ninth month, a Reuters poll found.Fueled by erratic rainfall and supply shocks from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prices of daily consumables like cereals and vegetables which form the largest category in the inflation basket have climbed over the past two years.Already reeling from COVID-19 pandemic-induced economic shocks, India's poor and middle classes will be further hit by the increases as they spend a large chunk of income on food.The Oct. 3-7 Reuters poll of 47 economists suggested inflation - as measured by the Consumer Price Index (INCPIY=ECI) - rose to an annual 7.30% in September from 7.00% the previous month. If realised, that would be the highest since May 2022.Forecasts for the data, due at 1200 GMT on Oct. 12, ranged between 6.60% and 7.80%. Some 91% of economists, 43 of 47, expected inflation to be 7.00% or higher, suggesting the bias was for prices to go up further.""There is a strong pressure from food that is playing out,"" said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.The Indian government has introduced measures to calm local prices, including some export restrictions on rice to temper inflation. But consumer prices have remained defiant and stayed above the RBI's upper tolerance limit this year.A weakening currency is also not helping. The battered Indian rupee hit a new low of 82.32/$ on Friday and was expected to remain under pressure over the next six months, a separate Reuters poll of FX analysts showed.That is likely to pressure the RBI, which has raised its key repo rate by 190 basis points in four moves this year, to intensify its interest rates hikes.""Against a more hostile global backdrop and a stickier inflation trajectory at home, we now expect a terminal rate of 6.75% - previously 6.25% - in this cycle,"" said Sajjid Chinoy, chief India economist at J.P. Morgan.""To the extent the rupee weakens, there will be passthrough effects to the CPI trajectory."""

According to family members, they are aged 18 to 32 while the identities of the rest 17 were still unverified.At the briefing, the Rab said the 55 people are from 19 districts and have joined a newly formed militant outfit called ""Jama'atul Ansar Fil Hindal Sharqiya"". The officials did not name any separatist group and only said it provides food supply and shelter to the militant outfit in exchange of money.The Jama'atul Ansar was formed by former members of three home-grown militant organisations -- Harkat-ul-Jihad Bangladesh, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh and Ansar Al Islam, they added.""Under the shelter of one or two separatist groups, the outfit members have been receiving training and running organisational activities from hideouts in remotest areas of the Chattogram Hill Tracts,"" Commander Khandaker Al Moin, director of Rab's Legal and Media Wing, told journalists.At the briefing, Rab said they arrested 12 people, including seven ""missing"" youths, over their involvement with the outfit.

He used to collect donations under various names and then send the money to the outfit's fund, Commander Moin said.Neyamat joined the outfit in 2019 and he was involved in coordinating and giving shelter to the youths leaving home to join militancy.Drawn to militancy, Hossain left home a year back, Saiful one and half months back, and Rakib two months back.On October 6, Rab claimed to have arrested seven others, including four ""missing"" youths from Munshiganj, Narayanganj, and Mymensingh.Rab has arrested the seven following information from Shartaz Islam Niloy, 22, who had gone missing from Cumilla on August 23 and returned to his Kolyanpur home on September 1.Commander Moin said this outfit targets youths and radicalises them after showing various videos of the persecution of Muslims and giving different misinterpretations of Islam.The outfit provides vocational training to its recruits in various fields like carpentry, painting and electrical work to help them run organisational activities under disguise, he added. ""We are now at the primary stage of investigation and we are yet to get any idea about who is leading the newly formed outfit.

The production shortfall yesterday was around 4,118MW, or a third of the national demand, according to Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB) data.""The power plants that run during the day are being kept idle at night, this is why load-shedding has increased,"" Nasrul Hamid, the state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, told reporters at the Secretariat yesterday.""We hoped that from October there would be no load-shedding, but we failed as we couldn't solve the gas shortage. There will be some difficulties this month, and I hope the situation will improve from next month,"" he added.The load-shedding situation worsened after the major blackout caused by the national grid failure last week, and now some power outages are happening just when people prepare to go to bed.According to last week's load-shedding schedule, at least 42 areas in the capital saw outages between midnight and 2:00am.The areas include Moghbazar, Malibagh, Khilgaon, Demra, Golapbagh, Postogola, Dhanmondi, Gendaria, Jurain, Ring Road, Elephant Road, Katabon, Green Road, Kalabagan, Bangla Motor, New Market, Sobhanbagh, and Niketan.At least half of these areas saw power outages between 1:00am and 2:00am.

The biggest shortage faced last week was 170MW.""We have nothing to do if we don't get the proper allotment,"" he said.Admitting that the schedules could not be followed, Kausar said, ""We were able to maintain the schedule about 90 percent last month, but we cannot even maintain 60 percent of it now.""The situation is worse outside the capital, with some districts experiencing hourly power cuts in turn between 12:00am and 6:00am.This includes all places under Mymensingh Palli Bidyut Samity-1 and -3, Dinajpur Palli Bidyut Samity-1, Jashore Palli Bidyut-1, Jhenidah, Kushtia, Manikganj, Laxmipur, Netrakona, and Sylhet Palli Bidyut Samity-2.The schedule is such that residents of these areas experience up to two hours of load-shedding at night, followed by more power outages in the morning.Just one feeder in Netrakona, servicing three unions, experiences load-shedding thrice in one night.Other districts like Gopalganj and Joypurhat experience load-shedding a few times at night, each outage at a different feeder.Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board yesterday scheduled daily load-shedding of up to 12 hours in Mymensingh's Muktagachha for this week.Shewli Akhter, a resident of Tarati union of Muktagachha, told this newspaper that load-shedding happened all the time.

While the 21st century is experiencing an explosion of scientific advances, there is a sense that intellectuals are no longer playing a major role as protagonists of change. The world seems to be moving towards the atomisation of life of the mind. Technology grows and thinking shrinks!The Bill Gates of the world marvel at the 21st century's major advances in the fields like gene editing, machine learning, driverless cars, robotic surgery, and artificial intelligence, among others. Mr Gates predicts that some of the breakthrough technologies will include custom cancer treatments tailored to a person's genome, sanitation without sewers, and carbon dioxide catchers.Science has advanced, but has philosophy retreated to the ivory tower? Economists and historians are taking an ever more visible role in public life, but why not philosophers?One of the profound questions that philosophy raises is the question of how one ought to live. Have philosophers and thinkers abandoned their traditional role as critics of our beliefs and practices? If yes, why?Is it because of the rise of ""corporatocracy"" or the exhaustion of the modern mind? Is it because of the sclerosis of institutions? Is it the internet which is leading to a certain kind of illiteracy? Is it too much to expect philosophy to continue answering Emmanuel Kant's questions: what can I know? What should I know? Even French philosophy, which made a lasting impact on rationalism, republicanism, feminism, positivism, existentialism and structuralism, seems to be in the doldrums. Today, rational discourse is in terribly short supply.Thinkers and public intellectuals are quietly disappearing as influential factors on the public scene. In ancient times, intellectuals and philosophers added character to society. When intellectuals shine a light on a public sphere, only then does a society flourish. Plato served as an adviser to the ruler of Syracuse. He travelled to the strife-torn court of Syracuse three times risking his life to create a philosopher king. John Stuart Mill served a term in parliament. Bertrand Russell got involved in nearly every public policy debate of his time.With our stress on techno-solutionism, many intellectuals have been forced to live in hermetic bubbles. Intellectuals also align today with corporate and institutional thinking. And uncompromising intellectuals like Noam Chomsky have become marginal as they are excluded from the mainstream media. Is smart technology dumbing down the human race? 
Philosopher David Blitz considers Russell like ""few others before him and even fewer after him"" bringing his intellectual acumen to bear on public issues. Public intellectuals often fight a war on the plane of ideas. But the industrial society, considered by some as a ""suicide machine,"" has squeezed the space for philosophy. Didn't Arnold Toynbee warn us that civilisations are not murdered – they commit suicide? How do we explain the greatest minds walking the earth over two millennia ago: Confucianism in China, the Upanishads and Buddhism in India, Homer's Greece and Hebrew prophets?
It was around 500-300 BC that saw the advent of the greatest religious, spiritual and philosophical traditions in Eurasian societies. German-Swiss philosopher Karl Jaspers explains that these societies independently embraced moral universalism, prompted by the teachings of Plato, the Hebrew prophets, Zarathustra, Buddha and Confucius. Does one assume that there are extraordinary times in history when the world throws up a torrent of genius?
But why was it possible then and not before? There are others who argue that these societies were not necessarily ""islands of light."" Plato's writings aren't really conceivable without Zoroastrianism and Egyptian moral ideals. Jonny Thompson, who teaches philosophy at Oxford, explains that ""when cultures, ideologies and peoples come together, great steps forward happen.""
The advent of great cities allowed great thinkers and intellectuals to debate and collaborate. Great cities nurtured great thinkers and philosophers. Cities thus spurred intellectual ferment. American diplomat and academic Nick Burns pose a rather provocative question: ""Who among today's literary figures has any chance of being recognised as a thinker on par with Dostoevsky or Marx?"" We still do have great minds amid us. The New York Times columnist Ross Douthat's list of most influential intellectuals today includes Ibram X Kendi, Robin Di Angelo, Steven Pinker, Peter Singer, Peter Thiel, and Yuval Noah Harari, among others.
Given the breadth of human genius, any intellectual hit parade would be an act of folly. One can at best talk of how scores of top minds are still shaping the future. Britain's influential Prospect magazine published a list of 50 thinkers in 2021.
It shortlisted the world's top 10 thinkers: Palestinian biologist Jacob Hana, physicist Carlo Rovelli, political theorist Mahmood Mamdani, historian of philosophy Peter Adamson, vaccine developers Ozlem Turecci and Ugur Sahin, English professor Priyamvada Gopal, theologian Mustafa Akyol, public health expert Devi Sreedhar, environmentalist Frans Schepers and essayist Rebecca Solnit. Prospect magazine's top five thinkers in 2005 were Noam Chomsky, Umberto Eco, Richard Dawkins, Václav Havel, and Christopher Hitchens. Have intellectuals become what JS Mill called ""the powerless people""? In the age of junk science and moral relativism, while some intellectuals have been reduced to instruments of manipulation, others have retreated, working alone, often engaged in esoteric theorising.
Nicolas Carr in his book Is Google Making Us Stupid? says that the daily use of the internet is ""rewriting our brains for skimming rather than the sustained concentration required by books.""

Susan Jacoby in Age of American Unreason argues that technology has damaged our ability to think. She further maintains that the rise of religious fundamentalism, the failure of public education to create an informed citizenry, and the triumph of video over print culture account for anti-intellectualism in the US.
This story is no different in India. Globally, the disconnect between the people and the intellectuals is widening. Intellectuals in India are often ridiculed by the ruling class. Today, parties prefer cheerleaders, rather than intellectuals. Those who have fallen from the great height of moral values are making the biggest splash.
The media, the gatekeepers, have long given up gatekeeping. Instead of public intellectuals, we now have pundits on TV channels. They denounce, mock, vituperate and lash out at their opponents in the strongest possible language. Their reasoning generates more heat than light. Social media is a poison tree. We need intellectuals and philosophers as they are the world's eyes. As Einstein said, ""Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them.""

/business/news/bsccls-profit-jumps-31-2021-22-3139851,BSCCL’s profit jumps 31% in 2021-22,"Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Limited (BSCCL) posted more than 31 per cent higher profit in the year that ended on June 30.This means the country's lone submarine cable operator made a profit of Tk 229.38 crore in the last financial year. It was Tk 174.96 crore a year earlier.Thus, BSCCL reported earnings per share of Tk 13.91 (diluted) in 2021-22 against Tk 10.61 (diluted) in 2020-21.The company said EPS increased thanks to a rise in revenue and other incomes for the ordinary course of business activities. There were no significant extraordinary transactions in 2021-22, said the company in a filing on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) today.Its net asset value per share stood at Tk 64.66 in the last financial year, which was Tk 52.49 in 2020-21, while net operating cash flow per share rose to Tk 16.76, an improvement from Tk 14.18 a year earlier.BSCCL emphasised revenue collection and took some stern steps for the realisation that led to a significant increment of cash received from clients as disclosed in the statement of cash flows. Consequently, the net operating cash flows per share went up compared to last year, said the filing. The board of directors announced a 46 per cent cash dividend for 2021-22.BSCCL also informed that it received the Submarine Cable Systems and Services Licence on April 19 from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission.But as the date of commencement of revenue sharing is not clear yet, the board approved provisioning for revenue sharing at the rate of 3 per cent earned from the services provided under that licence for the period from April 19 this year to June 30 this year.Shares of BSCCL closed 0.05 per cent down at Tk 218.90 on the DSE today."
