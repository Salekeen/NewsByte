I had no other option but to comply,"" he told The Daily Star yesterday.Asked whether he sought support from the law enforcers, Moshiur said, ""There were only four police personnel at the polling station and it was not possible for them to hold off such a big crowd.

""As I was busy with duties at another polling station, I asked him to call the patrol team.""At least four out of 16 presiding officers contacted by this newspaper claimed that they were forced by the local AL men and polling agents of the ruling party candidate to make written statements that the polls were free and fair.Md Abdul Latif, presiding officer of the polling centre at Jadurtair Government Primary School and Jadurtair High School, said around 15-16 youths forced him to write a statement that the voting was free and fair.""After the Election Commission suspended voting, we started preparing to return to the upazila parishad with polling materials. All of a sudden, 15-16 local youths surrounded the polling officials and started pressing me to announce the election results. I sought assistance from the police and Ansar members, but in vain. That's why I had to write that the voting atmosphere was good. I also mentioned the number of votes cast.""Another Presiding Officer Md Mahmudul Hasan said he learnt around 3:20pm that the voting was suspended, but he could not leave the centre as the polling agents of the AL candidate demanded announcement of the election results.""Therefore, I had to write a statement and hand it over to them before leaving the centre.""Milon Kumar Pal, presiding officer of Noshirarpara Government Primary School polling station, also had to submit a similar statement to the Saghata UNO office.He said when he returned all voting materials to the UNO office around 7:30pm, the UNO asked him to write a statement mentioning the number of votes cast. ""I was also asked to write that no unlawful incidents occurred at my polling station.""Asked why he signed the statement, Milon said, ""The UNO sir asked me to do so to avoid any administrative problems in future and I complied.""Bishnu Pad Singha, presiding officer of the Barkona Government Primary School and Barkona High School polling station, said when he returned to Saghata UNO office around 6:30pm, he came to know that over 50 presiding officers submitted written statements mentioning that the voting was free and fair.

Renuka then nicked off Harshitha Samarawickrama to add to their misery; the other opener Anushka Sanjeewani was also run out while attempting to complete a tight single.Renuka added two more to her figures and the spinners settled in, leaving Sri Lanka in dire straits at 16-5.Inoka Ranaweera top-scored with 18 runs as the reeling Lankans played out the 20 overs posting 65.Besides, Renuka's three, left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad and off-spinner Sneh Rana picked up two wickets each, while Deepti Sharma, who topped the wicket-takers chart, went wicketless.In reply, India lost experienced opener Shafali Verma for five and Jemimah Rodrigues for two inside the powerplay but Smriti motored on and smashed an unbeaten 51 runs off 25 balls as she hit six fours and three sixes and hit the winning runs with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur at the other end.""We should credit our bowlers. Our fielding unit was good from ball one and we discussed that we should not give away easy runs. You have to read the wicket and accordingly place the fielders in the right positions. We read the wicket well and position fielders accordingly. We were not looking at the scoreboard but only decided on five-over targets. We never thought about what is the total on the board and batted accordingly,"" the India skipper said in the post-match interview.Deepti was adjudged the player of the tournament for her all-round exploits, including 13 wickets and a useful 94 runs."
/news/bangladesh/news/park-coffee-cart-or-biryani-shop-3143006,"Park, coffee cart or biryani shop?","In Old Dhaka's Bangshal stands a park in the shape of a triangle. It used to provide citizens with an avenue to go on morning and evening walks, or spend their leisure surrounded by greenery.This park, which dates back to the pre-independence era, had a library, 10 to 12 benches to sit on, and a small field, where children used to play.But due to sheer apathy of the authorities concerned, this park soon lost its glamour.The size of the park gradually shrank, as land grabbing went on unabated, while the remaining parts were too dilapidated to visit.To salvage whatever was left of the park, the first elected mayor of Dhaka, Mohammad Hanif renovated it, and installed a water fountain and two dove sculptures, as a symbol of peace.To carry on his father's legacy, former Dhaka south mayor Sayeed Khokon renovated the park and inaugurated it for the public in 2020.New walkways,  fresh grass, extended seating arrangements and lights were installed at the place under this project, and the water fountain was made functional.Soon after, the park was leased out to Bangshal Thana Bangabandhu Parishad president Haji Ahsan Ullah. Under the lease agreement,  Ahsan and company were supposed to run a coffee shop, on condition of selling coffee in a wheeled cart alongside taking care of the park.Building any permanent structure to sell anything other than coffee wasn't permitted under this arrangement.But in a recent visit to the Bangshal Park, this correspondent saw that a permanent steel structure has been built there, occupying at least one-third of the place. There are lines of chairs and tables centring it, but rather than coffee, what's being served is biryani.Even the water fountain has been shut down to facilitate the biryani shop. There are a few washing basins, a deep freezer, and rows of plastic chairs and tables inside Haji Ebadullah Biryani House, owned by one Liton Baburchi.Biryani is also served at benches on all three sides of the park.Contacted, Liton Baburchi said he has rented the place from Ahsan Ullah.Locals said they cannot walk or sit in peace at the park anymore, as the place is always abuzz with the biryani shop's customers. Besides, the size of the already small park has reduced significantly because of the makeshift-restaurant, they added.Abdul Hai, a resident of Mokimbazar, Bangshal, said this park used to be bigger.""There was a library here. People came here to read books, walk and play. But the park gradually died.""""When the park was renovated in 2020, or whatever was left of it, the locals thought they would finally get a place to pass peaceful leisure. But the biryani shop has threatened the park's serenity,"" he added.The park's lessee, Haji Ahsan Ullah, said they run the shop ""legally"".He said, ""We run a biryani shop next to the coffee shop. The DSCC officers come for regular inspections. There are no issues.""Local (Ward-35) Councillor Abu Saeed said, ""The park was made for walking, but now it's a business place. People cannot sit and walk. I've made a verbal complaint about this to the city corporation. I'll send a written complaint soon.""DSCC Chief Property Officer Russell Sabrin said there's no scope to run a biryani place after taking permission for a coffee cart.""We will cancel our agreement if the conditions of the lease are being violated,"" he added."

A group of volunteers from Urban Study Group have been working relentlessly to protect these heritage buildings. However, it is certainly not enough.A collective effort is very important to save these heritage buildings, otherwise we will lose them all gradually. A group of volunteers from Urban Study Group have been working relentlessly to protect these heritage buildings. However, it is certainly not enough.""At least forty percent of the old houses in Shakhari Bazar bear the architecture of the Mughal period even today. In recent times, many houses have been demolished and redeveloped, while many changes were made during the British period,"" he said.""Through our work, we could make locals understand the necessity of heritage buildings and how the area will be maintained properly. Even the authorities agreed that safety issues and protecting heritage sites do not contradict each other,"" he said.""In 2008, when an important heritage building at Farashganj was on the verge of being demolished, a huge campaign was launched to protect that building. A heritage committee was formed at that time, which placed importance on area-based conservation,"" said Taimur. ""Initially, a list of 93 heritage buildings and four heritage areas was prepared for area-based conservation, and later, we continued to incorporate more buildings in the list. In 2018, the HC finally gave a status quo on 2,200 buildings in Old Dhaka, listed by Urban Study Group. However, even after the listing, over a dozen important heritage buildings have been demolished.""""We have already lost too much. The bright side is, though it took time, the government included provisions for transferring development rights to third parties in the latest Bangladesh National Building Code,"" he said, adding that similar points are present in the new Detailed Area Plan.Taimur said financial constraints are a major problem for the residents of heritage buildings, which is why making the development rights of such properties transferable to an appropriate third party is crucial.According to Taimur, it is deeply unfortunate that in the last 20 years, the Department of Archaeology did not include any new heritage building of Dhaka in its own list. Some structures, such as parts of Sankhanidhi and Barokatra, have already been demolished due to a lack of supervision from the authorities.""Just six months after the HC verdict on protecting heritage buildings, Jahajbari in Chawkbazar, Neelam Ghar, and several other buildings in Farashganj were demolished. The HC verdict mandated the protection of those sites, but they were still neglected and subjected to ruin,"" he said.The HC in its directives asked the Department of Archaeology to prepare a final list after assessing the 2,200-building list of Urban Study Group. Unfortunately, there is no progress in this regard as well, even after five years.""A collective effort is very important to save these heritage buildings, otherwise we will lose them all gradually. A group of volunteers from Urban Study Group have been working relentlessly to protect these heritage buildings. However, it is certainly not enough,"" said Taimur.""The authorities need to play a vital role in this regard. It is also essential to ensure exemplary punishment for those who are demolishing the heritage buildings,"" he added."

No, of course not,"" Putin said. There was ""no need for massive strikes"" now because most designated targets had been hit.""What is happening today is not pleasant.

/weekend-read/news/unbearable-burden-unemployed-youth-3143096,Unbearable burden on unemployed youth,"The decision to increase the job application fees for government jobs, except for cadre posts, has outraged the country's millions of job seekers who find it an additional burden on them, making their expenses heavier.According to the new circular issued by the finance ministry on September 22, application fees for posts of different grades have been increased up to two to three times the previous rate.For instance, the application fee for 9th-grade jobs has now been fixed at Tk 600. Previously, it was Tk 500, according to the national pay scale 2015.However, the application fee for 10th-grade positions has been kept at Tk 500. There is no fixed application fee for positions from 1st to 8th grades as these are top ranking posts.On the other hand, the fee for 11th to 16th-grade positions rose by Tk 100 to Tk 300. Now the applicants will have to pay Tk 300 as the fees for the 11th and 12th grades, and Tk 200 for the 13th to 16th grades.The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.Earlier, the application fee for 11th to 16th-grade positions was Tk 100, according to the finance ministry circular.The application fee for 17th to 20th-grade positions has doubled to Tk 100 from Tk 50.The jobseekers, many of whom are unemployed, say the move will exert financial pressure on them. Most of them apply for these jobs several times; so they have to spend the additional amount without any return.Even now, many applicants especially those who are from impoverished backgrounds find it extremely difficult to manage enough money to travel to and stay in Dhaka to appear for the job exams.""Many of us may think that Tk 500-600 is an insignificant amount. Yes, it might be when you get a monthly salary. But, for unemployed youth like us, every penny matters a lot,"" said Md Tobarak Hossain, a National University graduate who has been applying for government jobs for three years.""After the pandemic, many government organisations are posting job circulars. Last month, I applied for four positions and had to pay around Tk 2,000 as application fees. I had to struggle a lot to collect this money as I have no income currently. Increasing application fees in such a time will prove to be a massive blow for us,"" he said.I am struggling to collect money for submitting applications in October while saving some for the exams in November and December. This type of recruitment system where unemployed people have to pay a hefty amount is unjust.
Another jobseeker, Sumaya Khanam said apart from the application fees, they need to spend a huge amount of money for travel to take the recruitment tests.
""In August, I had to travel to Dhaka from my hometown Dinajpur three times to sit for those exams. I had to spend around Tk 15,000 that month just to travel to and stay in Dhaka to appear at the exams,"" she said.
There are several written exams coming up in November and December and application submission deadlines in October, she said.
""I am struggling to collect money for submitting applications in October while saving some for the exams in November and December. This type of recruitment system where unemployed people have to pay a hefty amount is unjust.""
Again, jobseekers are apprehensive that the finance ministry's move will encourage public sector enterprises to increase their application fee as they have been exempted in the circular.
Job application fees set by these organisations are already much higher than the usual fees for other government jobs.
This correspondent analysed recently published 10 circulars of different public enterprises and found that application fees range from Tk 700 to over Tk 1,000.
For instance, Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) published a circular for recruiting medical officers where the application fee was Tk 1,000.
Similarly, Rural Power Company Limited published a job circular for positions ranging from grade 10 to grade 4. However, the application fee for all applicants was Tk 1,000.
Khulna Development Authority published a circular for 16 positions. For the positions of assistant engineer (9th grade) and sub-assistant engineer (10th grade), the application fee was Tk 700. For all other positions, the application fee was Tk 500.
On the other hand, Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited (DPDC) will recruit 33 assistant engineers and the application fee it charged was Tk 1,500.
""If these state-run enterprises also increase the job application fees following the finance ministry's decision, it will be impossible for us to apply for many of these jobs. The government has been imposing an unbearable burden on us in the name of job application fees and recruitment exams,"" said Sumaya.
The finance ministry, however, claims that they have not increased the application fees, it was ""adjusted"" for the benefit of the job seekers.
Md Golam Mostofa, additional secretary (regulation) of the finance ministry, told The Daily Star, ""Previously application fee for 9th-grade and 10th-grade jobs was the same. We have just slightly increased the fee for 9th-grade positions but did not increase the latter.""
The application fee for positions of 11th to 16th grade was the same but their salary was not equal. ""So, we have re-adjusted the application according to the grade of the positions in accordance with the pay scale,"" he said.
Golam Mostofa said the government does not intend to earn from the application fees. Even the application fees barely cover 10 percent of the expenditure required to arrange job exams.
""We take these fees as a token money from the job seekers so that they take the exams seriously.""
Asked how this decision will be enforced and why the state-run enterprises have been exempted, he commented, ""The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.""
""State-run enterprises are supposed to run on their own income. This is why we have exempted them from this measure,"" he added.
Experts, however, have opined against this step saying that the step would cause suffering for millions of job seekers and unemployed youths.
Former Cabinet Secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, ""We expected the government would decrease job application fees considering the current economic situation. Increasing application fees at this time when many people have been suffering from income loss due to the pandemic is not the appropriate step.
""There can be a fee for applying for government jobs but that fee has to be nominal and affordable for all citizens.""

We have just slightly increased the fee for 9th-grade positions but did not increase the latter.""The application fee for positions of 11th to 16th grade was the same but their salary was not equal. ""So, we have re-adjusted the application according to the grade of the positions in accordance with the pay scale,"" he said.Golam Mostofa said the government does not intend to earn from the application fees. Even the application fees barely cover 10 percent of the expenditure required to arrange job exams.""We take these fees as a token money from the job seekers so that they take the exams seriously.""Asked how this decision will be enforced and why the state-run enterprises have been exempted, he commented, ""The finance ministry allocates budget for the relevant departments for arranging job exams. If they do not abide by the decision, they will not get the allocation for arranging exams.""""State-run enterprises are supposed to run on their own income. This is why we have exempted them from this measure,"" he added.Experts, however, have opined against this step saying that the step would cause suffering for millions of job seekers and unemployed youths.Former Cabinet Secretary Ali Imam Majumder said, ""We expected the government would decrease job application fees considering the current economic situation. Increasing application fees at this time when many people have been suffering from income loss due to the pandemic is not the appropriate step.""There can be a fee for applying for government jobs but that fee has to be nominal and affordable for all citizens.""  "

However, she prefers being selective about her works. From her journey of ""Kolpona"" to ""Shuhashini"", her memorable smile leaves a mark on the audience's hearts. The young actress, who is still a student of North South University, stands in front of The Daily Star's camera for an exclusive shoot. Recently, you posted pictures when you travelled to India. How was your tour?I went to Darjeeling with friends, during our semester break. It was an amazing tour. When we complete our graduation, we will be busier than ever. If we don't enjoy these moments with friends now, then when?You will be seen on the silver screen very soon with the film ""Jaya Aar Sharmin"". What other projects did you work on?
I recently worked in Rubel Anush's ""Newmarket"", and puja special fiction ""Sharod Prate"" directed by Chayanika Chowdhury. I am receiving positive responses for both projects. As for ""Jaya Aar Sharmin"", I worked on this project before we shot ""Kolpona"", an episode from ""Ei Muhurte"". To me, the medium is irrelevant, I just want to learn at this stage of my career.
Within a small span of time, you have earned much love from the audience. Do you have any secrets to share?
Acceptance matters a lot, and I think I am fortunate enough that people have showered me with so much love within such a short time. Also, Aryan Bhai told me an interesting fact – my facial features are a personification of Bengal itself (giggles).



What are you currently busy with?
I am actually towards the end of my graduation, and at this time, I am trying to focus more on my education. Besides I am doing some photoshoots and in talks with some television projects. I have to think a lot before taking up any web project, because it needs concentration and time. After completing graduation, I will be able to take up more OTT projects. 
 








Before appearing on Mizanur Rahman Aryan's ""Shuhashini""( girl with pretty smile), did your friends give you that title?
My friends started calling me 'Shuhashini' after the fiction was released.
Is it true that you agreed to do a small role in ""Taqdeer"", just because Chanchal Chowdhury will be playing the protagonist in it?
Yes, it is true, and honestly, working with the entire team (Film Noir) was a great experience. Working in the same project with Chanchal Chowdhury, who is my inspiration and sharing the screens with Manoj Pramanik is something I can brag about.








Totini living in the moment Read more
If you were to share one thing you like and one you dislike the most about yourself, what would it be?
People say that I am humble and kind. At the same time, I really like cats and dogs—This is one of those features which one should have, I believe.
 








One thing I do not like about myself is that at times, I feel extremely insecure, which I know I shouldn't and I should be more confident.
 








How do you manage the transition of getting in and out from one character to another?
It is really tough. I still remember after completing ""Kolpona"", I was struggling to get out of the shooting atmosphere and the character I portrayed.  Even today, whenever I feel extremely low, I feel that character.

/news/bangladesh/crime-justice/news/blogger-oyasiqur-killing-complainant-unavailable-3143036,Blogger Oyasiqur killing: Complainant ‘unavailable’ ,"Seven years into the murder of secularist blogger Oyasiqur Rahman Babu, the complainant of the case appears uninterested in justice and the police are clueless about his whereabouts.Till July 24, the court summoned the complainant, Monir Hossain Masud, 63 times and even ordered his arrest, only to get his all-important testimony. And the prosecution and the police could not produce him, stating every time that he has been living in Saudi Arabia, according to court documents.But Masud, who is a cousin and also the brother-in-law of Oyasiqur, now lives in Dhaka and The Daily Star caught up with him in Arambagh area, where he runs a grocery shop.""I went to Saudi Arabia almost a month after the case was filed and returned home one and a half years ago. I did not get any court order since then,"" Masud told this newspaper recently.He, however, showed his reluctance in testifying before the court. ""Actually, I have no interest in the case now,"" he said without any elaboration.According to the FIR, Masud's permanent address is Uttar Hazipur under Ramganj upazila in Lakshmipur.Opting not to be named, a few of his acquaintances in the locality said Masud's attitude towards the brutal killing changed abruptly after he somehow become convinced that Oyasiqur was killed for ""anti-Islamic writings"".""Anti-Islamic writings"" was the twisted justification of fundamentalists who went on the killing spree targeting bloggers and free-thinkers since 2013.Armed with machetes, a gang of banned militant outfit Ansarullah Bangla Team (ATB) hacked Oyasiqur, known for his secularist views and write-ups against fundamentalists in online spheres, in broad daylight at the Tejgaon industrial area on March 30, 2015.Locals caught two of the attackers on the spot and handed them over to the police.It was a year that witnessed three more killings of secularist bloggers -- Avijit Roy on February 26, Ananta Bijoy Das on May 12, Niladri Chattopadhyay Niloy on August 7 -- and also Faisal Arefin Dipan, publisher of Avijit's books, on October 31.  Masud filed a murder case against four named and some unknown persons with the Tejgaon Industrial Police Station on the day of the attack.""We are yet to present the first information report before the court as the complainant did not appear for testimony despite repeated court summons and non-bailable arrest warrants,"" Assistant Public Prosecutor Salahuddin Howlader told The Daily Star.He said that after police informed the court that the complainant was living in Buraydah, the capital of Al-Qassim province of Saudi Arabia, the court order to produce the complainant for testimony was sent to the foreign ministry three times in 2019 and 2020.""If the complainant's statements cannot be recorded, the judgment in the case may contain some incompleteness; even the accused may be acquitted in the case,"" Salahuddin said.He said the police is the only agency responsible for producing witnesses before the court.Emdadul Haque, officer-in-charge of Ramganj Police Station in Lakshmipur, told The Daily Star that he assigned ASI Shakhawat Hossain to serve the latest summons issued against complainant Masud.ASI Shakhawat on August 22 sent a report to the court, saying the respected citizens of the area concerned did not know the complainant. He also requested the court to send the proper name and address of the complainant.Contacted, Shakhawat told The Daily Star on September 19, ""I have heard that the complainant's family lives in Dhaka. But, I'm not sure whether the complainant is in the country or abroad.""However, Masud Alam, ward member of Chandipur Union Parishad under Ramganj, told The Daily Star, ""The complainant is now doing business in Dhaka after his return from Saudi Arabia.""Mohammad Shaheenoor Islam, a noted criminal lawyer in Dhaka, said, ""There are instances of police not visiting the witness' address to serve a summons. Instead, they send reports to the court, saying the witnesses' addresses could not be found.""He added, ""Sometimes police can't serve the summons due to changes in witness' addresses.""THE CASEOver the killing of Oyasiqur, Shah Md Mashiur Rahman, an inspector of the Detective Branch, submitted a charge sheet to a Dhaka court on September 2, 2015, accusing five members of ABT.The Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court-3 of Dhaka on July 20, 2016 framed charges against the five ABT members -- Zikrullah, Ariful Islam, Saiful Islam, Akram Hossain Hasib alias Boro Bhai and Junayed Ahmed alias Taher.Of them, Zikrullah, Ariful and Saiful are behind bars, while the other two are on the run.According to the prosecution, 24 witnesses out of 40 gave their depositions before the court.The court set October 27, 2020 for delivering judgment in the case, but withheld its decision following a petition from the prosecution for adding section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Penal Code.The court on November 4, 2020 reframed the charges against the accused.After reframing of charges, some of the key witnesses have been recalled, but Masud never appeared, said the prosecution.The last hearing of the case took place on September 20.Legal experts said even if the complainant becomes ""hostile"", the prosecution can still cross-examine him or her. But there is no scope to change the complainant in criminal cases, they added.Khurshid Alam Khan, a criminal law expert, said, ""Even if the complainant becomes hostile in a case, the court can award appropriate punishment to the accused, considering statements of other witnesses or circumstantial evidence."""

Some were even deceived by the suggestion that they weren't being sent to play cricket, but instead to do what they actually wanted in life.One of the enforced cricketers vented his frustration on social media anonymously. ""Since my childhood, I wanted to be a TikToker. I used to make TikTok videos with a bat in hand pretending to be a batter. One day, BCB texted me and told me that they were sending the country's best TikTokers to foreign countries for better training so that our country would get a TikToker like Khaby Lame.""I agreed, but they sent me on 22 yards of a cricket pitch to face bowlers. How do they expect a TikToker like me to hit the ball delivered by professional cricketers over the boundary?"" the fake cricketer fumed.A probe by Satireday found the above TikToker was not the only one who fell victim to this deception. ""I wanted to become a renowned model. They asked me to be ready with my baggage and sent me to a foreign country, saying that I would be in some photoshoots. But, instead of photographers, I found only bats and balls. Who will let them know that I just wanted to be a model, not a cricketer?"" he asked, claiming to be previously deceived by an e-commerce scammer.A gym instructor, who was also forcibly sent to a foreign country to play cricket, said, ""They found me physically strong and fit and assumed I would be a good hitter of cricket balls. They asked me to be a cricketer and when I refused, they threatened me. The next day, I found myself on a field where a Pakistani bowler was rushing towards me and then threw a hard ball at me. I tried to defend myself with the bat in my hands, but somehow, it hit the stumps.""I really didn't know what actually happened and later, I was speechless when I found that people were bashing me for not being a good batter. How will I convince them that I have never wanted to be a cricketer?"" he said with tears in his eyes.When asked about these allegations, BCB emperor said, ""Thank you for your question. We will win the next world cup. Thank you all and bye."" "

/opinion/views/news/tailor-made-partition-saga-orchestrated-disaster-3142771,‘Tailor-Made’ Partition: Saga of an Orchestrated Disaster,"Seventy-five years after the Partition of the Indian subcontinent, we are still a long way from understanding the complex ways in which this event affected the everyday lives of people and communities then, and how it still continues to shape our collective consciousness, politics and ways of being. This series, featuring scholars of partition studies from across the subcontinent – and to be published every Saturday for the next two months – is an attempt at exploring the complexities and contradictions of the momentous event that forever changed the contours of this region. This article, the second in the series, looks into the aftereffects of Partition in the region of Bengal.In August this year, India and Pakistan celebrated 75 years of independence and their emergence as nation-states on the map of South Asia. In 1947, ""United India"" got vivisected, in which Punjab and Bengal experienced the divide. This political separation compelled at least 15 million religious minorities to leave their respective ""homelands"" in search of safe shelters and security of life, and to become a part of the majority community. It remains one of the largest human displacements in the history of South Asia. Yet, the idea of building a nation with a certain homogenous religious community did not click in the case of Pakistan. The aspiration of the Bangalees to make a state based on linguistic identity led to another division in 1971, resulting in the emergence of a third nation-state: Bangladesh. In this process, the Bengal borderland experienced an exodus of another 10 million people. Therefore, from the 1940s, Bengal witnessed the migration of Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists, Bangalees and non-Bangalees, tribal refugees through the ""open,"" ""porous"" and ""notional"" borderlands, officially up till the signing of the Indira-Mujib pact of 1972. On the Indian side, the bordering states of east and northeast India such as West Bengal, Assam, Tripura, hilly regions of Mizoram and Meghalaya became the den of the Partition-displaced refugees and sharanarthis during the Liberation War. In East Bengal/Pakistan, the inflow of the incoming Muslim refugees and their resettlements led to the spatial reorganisation of the urban centres, existing cities, some mufassil towns, and other suburban areas.Interestingly, if we look at the academic writings on Partition, from 1950s to 1960s, some historians and political scientists seemed comfortable in terming this incident ""achieving independence"" from the colonial rulers. Social scientists started using the word ""Partition"" unhesitatingly from the 1970s. Therefore, it would be intriguing to investigate the key reason behind such portrayal. Let's question ourselves: what are the popular imageries of independence/Partition that we tend to keep in mind? Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, in his ""Tryst with Destiny"" speech, jubilantly mentioned that India was born ""at the stroke of the midnight hour… to life and freedom."" Muhammad Ali Jinnah, indeed, in his first lecture at the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, declared the idea of maintaining ""complete sovereignty"" in Pakistan. He portrayed a liberal view of nationhood by saying, ""We are starting with the fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one state."" Hence, from the ideological perspective, it is noticeable that both the nations were trying hard to create a definite image, and acceptance of culture suitable to a modern state system, to communicate their ideologies to the world.But what happened at the ground level? Why use the term ""tailor-made"" in describing Partition? The line that divided the Indian subcontinent was the Radcliffe Line. Instead of the concept of ""natural frontier,"" drawing ""lines"" as ""political borders"" was a European concept. The task of imagining two nations by drawing a ""notional border"" was assigned to Sir Cyril Radcliffe. The terms of reference of the commission were ""to demarcate the boundaries of the two parts of Bengal on the basis of ascertaining the contiguous areas of Muslim and non-Muslim."" When Radcliffe's proverbial red pencil was moving in zigzag movements to create new nations, he did not think he was dividing people. To him, it was ""just a line."" In his report, the sentences were like ""…a line shall be drawn along the boundary between the thana of… a line shall then be drawn from the point… a line should run… the line should then turn…"" It was this ""running"" and ""turning"" ""line"" that designed borders and divided people. The line on the map was more cartographic than real.Why describe this incident as an orchestrated disaster? Since Partition was planned on religious lines, both Hindus and Muslims in India and Pakistan migrated as refugees to the other side of the border to become members of the majoritarian community in their ""promised land,"" to get rid of their ""minority"" status in the country of origin. But in most of the cases, the refugees faced multiple layers of hazards and discriminations; the dream of ""homecoming"" turned into disillusionment for most of them, and they were rather treated like outsiders. In the three major refugee absorbent states of eastern and northeast India, i.e. West Bengal, Assam and Tripura, the connotations to define a Hindu refugee family migrating from East Bengal were udbastu, chhinnomul, sharanarthi, bangal and bhatia (in West Bengal), Mymensinghia, bhogonia, Bongals or Bongali, bohiragoto, bideshi (in Assam), and wansa or wansan sa in Kokborok – wanjoi means Bangalee and sa is son (in Tripura). In Pakistan, the popular terms to denote a refugee are muhajir or mohajer, panahgirs (in Urdu newspapers), refu-rifu, malaun and ghoti. Most of the connotations often depict a picture that they could never get rid of the idea of having different, diverse, multiple identities. One unique example of such derogatory treatments may derive from naming a plant as refugee lota in the Barak/Surma valley of Assam, in Cachar. Refugees were compared with a plant, which grows fast without having any particular use. The Hindu and Muslim refugees, the actual offspring of Partition, neither managed to get equal treatment in the societies they migrated to, nor did the brethren of their own nation-state welcome them with open arms.What happened on the policymaking fronts? After World War II, some international humanitarian organisations and aid agencies such as the UNHCR started working among the displaced persons, refugees and asylum-seekers, to promote peace, security and friendship among the nations, and provide protection and assistance to the refugees from 1950. The idea of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention was planned, and the treaty was signed in this particular background. India, being the largest refugee-absorbent country in South Asia, chose not to sign the 1951 convention. Being the prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru's decision surprised the world as he announced that India would take the fullest responsibility for its refugees, without taking help from the International Refugee Organisation (IRO). Later, India decided not to be an official signatory to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Nehru was probably hesitant to consider whether India would be able to maintain the minimum standard of hospitality towards refugees or not, and he decided to keep the issue as an internal matter. Likewise, Pakistan and Bangladesh didn't ratify the 1951 Convention or the 1967 Protocol. These countries never treated refugees as ""resources for nation-building."" The UNHCR could never work actively and help them in developing national laws or proper structures because these countries hadn't ratified the convention. Therefore, financial support to these countries from high-income countries in the cause of supporting refugees has always been ad hoc or indirect.What were the actual policies towards the refugees and other minorities in India and Pakistan? While dealing with issues of nation-building, India officially tried to shape discourses of secularism, caste identities, ideas about majority-minority relations and transborder migrations. Its centre government was desperate to discourage migration on the Bengal side. Nehru tried to convey the impression that the overall situation in East Bengal was improving when it was deteriorating. The relief and rehabilitation policies changed time and again, and to obtain such benefits from the state, a migrant had to first prove his or her family members as displaced persons, migrant, evacuee or refugee, and produce documents like migration certificate, citizenship certificate or any relevant papers to procure a job through the option system. But the document regime was too troublesome for the lower-middle class and lower class/caste refugees.Surprisingly, in both the countries, the policies of the centre towards the eastern border were visibly different from those for the western side. In East Pakistan, all the Muslim refugees didn't receive equal treatment. The politics of connection to one culture or one's ""otherness"" played vital roles to the authorities. The top administrative posts were mostly held by West Pakistanis, and they were prompt in providing relief measures and rehabilitation to the Urdu/Hindi-speaking Biharis. Similarly, for the Bangalee provincial officers, the issue of ""linguistic resemblance"" became the ""positive bond"" to understand the crisis of Bangalee refugees. A discriminatory attitude was visible in everything: the nature of distributing requisitioned and acquisitioned houses, evacuee properties, etc. In some areas, in which the refugees were sheltered and later rehabilitated, the host communities turned tremendously hostile to them as they did not want to share their lands and resources.What about the experience of Hindu refugees who migrated to the Indian states adjacent to the Bengal borderland? The upper class, elite Hindus generally enjoyed political-economic power as a social category in East Bengal. After migrating to West Bengal, they suddenly found themselves stranded on the wrong side of the border. Even the educated middle class, who used to have their cultural capital, realised that the land to which they had migrated was not like the place they had dreamt of. I have interviewed people like Shefalika Pathak, who said Partition was like a blessing to her. She migrated from Netrakona, struggled hard to get proper education, and became the headmistress of a government school in Shahid Nagar Colony. Refugees who migrated to Assam faced discrimination in receiving relief and rehabilitation facilities from the state government. The reason behind this kind of mentality was evident in contemporary sources. For example, the Assam Tribune published on August 2, 1949, ""The inflow of Hindu refugees in Assam was so enormous (that) the Hindu refugees would apparently create a Bengal in this province."" The community crisis was more acute in Tripura, as the hegemonic tendency of the Bangalee refugees made the tribal domiciles insecure. Bodhrong Deb Burma, a Kokborok schoolteacher by profession, opined how they considered the Bangalee refugees as a threat to their existence. Partition left a blow in Shillong, too, which used to be a hub for the English-educated East Bengal Hindus. Sushil Nag, a former gaonburah (village headman) of the Keating Road area, narrated how the Bangalee officers had to migrate to other states in India, chiefly after the creation of Meghalaya as a separate state.What was there on the other side of the coin? The indigenous communities of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), Khasi and Jaintia Hills, Garo Hills suffered immensely because of Partition; no regulations and official notifications were there for the paharis. For example, the Chakma and Hajong families of CHT remained as one of the worst sufferers of Partition. They had to migrate to Arunachal Pradesh, as a result of the construction of the Kaptai Dam in the Pakistan period. The Arunachal Pradesh Chakma Gaonburah Association published a statement on August 23, 2021, ""We are very worried about our future as we and our forefathers have suffered long enough because of Partition. We oppose any move to disturb, dismember or dislodge the Chakma community from the state any further."" Therefore, the members of those jummo families still perceived Kaptai Lake as a site of a heart-breaking event called Bor Porong or ""the great exodus."" The Census of Un-Rehabilitated Displaced Persons conducted surveys in 1959-1960, to understand the number of refugees who were rehabilitated in Dacca, Narayanganj, Khulna, Chittagong, Chandraghona and Kaptai. This report stated clearly that the rehabilitation work completed up till 1960 was not impressive. The refugee migration process was endless to and from this region, yet such physical, practical and professional vacuums made the absorption procedure comfortable in East Pakistan. Only the Biharis could never be a part of the traditional Bangalee society of East Pakistan. As Urdu speakers, they preferred West Pakistanis over their Bangalee neighbours. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, they became ""non-Bangalee agents"" of the West Pakistani ruling class. Khalid Hussain, once a resident of the Geneva Camp in Dhaka, narrated how they suffered for different reasons both under the banner of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationalism.What are the issues, which remained unfinished after the 75th year, that Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are facing as the ""long-term impact of Partition""? Partition gave birth to new socio-political units like camps, colonies, enclaves, and borderlands, among many others. But none of the nation-states are making policies and arranging protective measures to save the minorities from the insecurities of diverse kinds of identity politics. Simultaneously, nation-states are terming the ""illegal immigrants"" ""criminals,"" when most of the political parties often employ them in unlawful activities, use them as vote banks by providing them with voter cards or other national identity cards. These complexities and contradictions can be noticed in policymaking, too. For example, the introduction of NRC and CAA in India evoked diverse reactions towards its minorities and different minority communities from the neighbouring countries. But if we look at films like Simantarekha by Tanvir Mokammel or Shankhachil by Goutam Ghose, the narratives often portray a picture of hope, the legacy of the shared history and composite culture of Bengal.Though feelings of uncertainty and insecurity are there, citizens of all three countries are curious to know more about the other side of the border. For example, Anam Zakaria, a renowned oral historian from Pakistan, wrote in her book 1971 that when she came out from the airport during a visit to Bangladesh, ""… busy looking around, trying to take in the first sights of Dhaka,"" she and her partner saw a security van for their protection, and ""within the first twenty-four hours of our arrival, we would witness first-hand the bitterness and often sheer hatred against Pakistanis"" (Pp. 22-23). Probably because of the positive role that India played in 1971 and the consequent bonding, the relationship between Bangladesh and India, especially between the two Bengals, continued to remain warm. But Pakistan is still like a ""dark zone"" to most Indians. Manimugdha Sharma, fellow at the Institute of Asian Research, School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, University of British Columbia, echoed this by saying, ""We Indians and Pakistanis bond so well outside South Asia; it's a shame that we can't do it in the subcontinent."" In reality, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan continued to practise majoritarian politics even after 1971, and therefore they remained hotbeds of unending politics over minorities, illegal immigrants and other asylum-seekers, especially over their changing identities and citizenships. Anindita Ghoshal is associate professor of history at Diamond Harbour Women's University in Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

We rely heavily on overtime. But due to load-shedding, we have to pause our production for several hours every day. And there is no overtime,"" said Sharif, a garment factory worker in Gazipur.He added that his monthly earning has been around Tk 9,000 for the last three months.""I have stopped buying almost all the non-essential items and am still finding it hard to make ends meet,"" said the man in his early 30s.His sister Sumaiya Begum and her daughter live with him in his shanty in Kashimpur area of Gazipur city.""We recently stopped having breakfast. We take the day's first meal at lunch. I used to give my daughter a glass of milk or an egg every two days. Now, we do this once a week at most. We have also reduced buying medicines for our ailing mother,"" she told The Daily Star.Similar stories of hardship were heard from many industry workers.Kod Banu, cleaner of a printing mill in the capital's Tejgaon, saw her monthly income drop by Tk 1,500 because her employers have been closing the factory early since July.""I get Tk 8,000 a month.

/news/bangladesh/agriculture/news/farmers-kick-start-freshwater-machine-3142976,Farmers kick-start a freshwater machine,"Water is everywhere in and around Bangladesh, yet the lack of freshwater is one of its most pressing concerns.On the surface of this largest river delta on the planet, the abundance of water is facing serious threats of pollution, river encroachment, flooding, and diversion or obstruction of common river waters by India and China. And beneath the surface, there develops a big hollow due to the overdraw of groundwater for irrigation and industrialisation.The scarcity of surface water, especially in the dry season, is gradually pushing Bangladesh to depend heavily on groundwater for supply to households, farms, and industries. While the water outlook for one of the most fertile soils in the world is getting grimmer, a highly-acclaimed research holds out a big hope for Bangladesh, dispelling the commonly-shared fear of the groundwater reserve getting drier every year, and a Jakarta-like land subsidence resulting from it.""It is a ground-breaking research for all sorts of reasons,"" exclaimed the lead researcher Mohammad Shamsudduha over the phone from London Thursday.Published a month ago in the renowned journal Science, six scientists -- five of whom are Bangladeshis -- wrote in their research paper about a great water reservoir below Bangladesh that hardly runs dry. The more water is pumped out of the ""Bengal Water Machine"", as the researchers called it, the more water is pumped into it from the vertical and horizontal flow of freshwater from the surface and nearby lateral water sources.The machine is being considered by geoscientists as nature's very special gift to the people in the Bengal basin, a vast sediment-filled region upon which lies Bangladesh and a part of West Bengal.""This is a huge discovery for Bangladesh. One-third of Bangladesh is getting the benefit of nature's gift,"" Shamsudduha, a professor at the University College London, told The Daily Star. ""It can revolutionise our farming further, as irrigation strategy could now be set scientifically.""The vast underground reservoir for freshwater was crafted slowly over thousands of years by the Ganges and the Brahmaputra that brought in tons of silt and sediment every year from as far away as the Himalayas to form the delta's spongy soil.The Bengal Water Machine was created but not quite started until the 1980s, when Bangladesh stepped up on its rice production in the dry season. Unknowingly, millions of farmers actually kick-started the natural water system by pumping out groundwater for irrigation.Equipped with pumps and agricultural improvements, drought-hit farmers in the north and north-west have gone for extensive irrigation that enabled Bangladesh to produce enough food each year to be nearly self-sufficient by tripling the country's rice production.The geological formation of this Bengal basin responded strangely to the overdraw of the groundwater, with greater depletion triggering faster recharge.""If there was no pumping, then there would have been no water machine functioning,"" said co-researcher Professor Kazi Matin Uddin Ahmed, who is a hydrogeologist at the University of Dhaka. ""When farmers extract more groundwater, the water level falls and it creates room for additional recharge.""Boosting yields aside, the natural water system is believed to have been helping lessen flooding during monsoon seasons. ""If there is no recharge, all the water would be on the surface. Then, we would have a bigger flood,"" said Matin.The entire ecosystem works like a well-oiled machine: farmers pump water out and the porous soil quickly captures the rain-running-flood water before sending it down to the water machine with filtration through layers of soil on the way. Freshwater is stored in reservoirs at different depths, with the majority amount easily accessible by farmers at 100 feet below.About 1,500-2,000 litres of groundwater are required for the production of only one kg of rice in the dry season. And the amount of groundwater that is being pumped in three months for irrigating Boro paddy is mind-blowing.According to a World Bank study in 2021, about 32 cubic kilometres of groundwater is being extracted by the farmers every year, with which a three-story ""water building"" could be built over Bangladesh.Much to the relief, the researchers have found that the Bengal Water Machine kicks in to dispel most of the overdraw concern. Freshwater amounting to 75-90 cubic kilometres were captured and pumped back into the water machine from 1988-2018. Still, there's a huge shortfall.The withdrawal-recharge ratio is not that encouraging and consistent among all regions of Bangladesh. The rice-producing north is precariously-placed. On the other hand, the west generally experiences less rainfall than the east and it reflects on the outcome. Groundwater depletion is taking place in the west but not in the east, finds research.""Apart from the rice-producing north, the Bengal Water Machine is also not working well in the greater Dhaka region, big cities, and industrial areas,"" said co-researcher Prof Anwar Zahid, also a director at the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB).""We must use the groundwater very judiciously and cautiously, looking at the data. Indiscriminate use will only make a disaster imminent,"" warns Anwar, theleading groundwater expert and a key resource person behind the research that spanned over 10 years.The reason why the research is being so hailed across the globe is because of its foundation, a trove of data painstakingly put together over 30 years by the BWDB.Over a thousand observers of the BWDB wells have been monitoring and recording the underground water levels for 60 years by now. And, the researchers used millions of groundwater measurements from 465 shallow monitoring wells (mostly at 25-70 meters depth, from where pumping for irrigation is done).""Groundwater deeper than that level should not be used for irrigation as recharge by rainfall to that level [over 250-300 meters] takes hundreds to thousands of years,"" Anwar said.The other researchers are Richard G Taylor from University College London, Md Izazul Haq and Sara Nowreen."

/business/economy/opinion/news/how-countries-should-respond-the-strong-dollar-3143241,How countries should respond to the strong dollar,"The dollar is at its highest level since 2000, having appreciated 22 per cent against the yen, 13 per cent against the euro and 6 per cent against emerging market currencies since the start of this year. Such a sharp strengthening of the dollar in a matter of months has sizable macroeconomic implications for almost all countries, given the dominance of the dollar in international trade and finance.While the US share in world merchandise exports has declined from 12 per cent to 8 per cent since 2000, the dollar's share in world exports has held around 40 per cent. For many countries fighting to bring down inflation, the weakening of their currencies relative to the dollar has made the fight harder.On average, the estimated pass-through of a 10 per cent dollar appreciation into inflation is 1 per cent. Such pressures are especially acute in emerging markets, reflecting their higher import dependency and greater share of dollar-invoiced imports compared with advanced economies.The dollar's appreciation also is reverberating through balance sheets around the world. Approximately half of all cross-border loans and international debt securities are denominated in US dollars. While emerging market governments have made progress in issuing debt in their own currency, their private corporate sectors have high levels of dollar-denominated debt.As world interest rates rise, financial conditions have tightened considerably for many countries. A stronger dollar only compounds these pressures, especially for some emerging market and many low-income countries that are already at a high risk of debt distress.In these circumstances, should countries actively support their currencies? Several countries are resorting to foreign exchange interventions. Total foreign reserves held by emerging market and developing economies fell by more than 6 per cent in the first seven months of this year.The appropriate policy response to depreciation pressures requires a focus on the drivers of the exchange rate change and on signs of market disruptions. Specifically, foreign exchange intervention should not substitute for warranted adjustment to macroeconomic policies. There is a role for intervening on a temporary basis when currency movements substantially raise financial stability risks and/or significantly disrupt the central bank's ability to maintain price stability.As of now, economic fundamentals are a major factor in the appreciation of the dollar: rapidly rising US interest rates and a more favourable terms-of-trade—a measure of prices for a country's exports relative to its imports—for the US caused by the energy crisis.Fighting a historic increase in inflation, the Federal Reserve has embarked on a rapid tightening path for policy interest rates. The European Central Bank, while also facing broad-based inflation, has signaled a shallower path for their policy rates, out of concern that the energy crisis will cause an economic downturn. Meanwhile, low inflation in Japan and China has allowed their central banks to buck the global tightening trend.The massive terms-of-trade shock triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the second major driver behind the dollar's strength. The euro area is highly reliant on energy imports, in particular natural gas from Russia. The surge in gas prices has brought its terms of trade to the lowest level in the history of the shared currency.As for emerging markets and developing economies beyond China, many were ahead in the global monetary tightening cycle—perhaps in part out of concern about their dollar exchange rate—while commodity exporting EMDEs experienced a positive terms-of-trade shock. Consequently, exchange-rate pressures for the average emerging market economy have been less severe than for advanced economies, and some, such as Brazil and Mexico, have even appreciated.Given the significant role of fundamental drivers, the appropriate response is to allow the exchange rate to adjust, while using monetary policy to keep inflation close to its target. The higher price of imported goods will help bring about the necessary adjustment to the fundamental shocks as it reduces imports, which in turn helps with reducing the buildup of external debt. Fiscal policy should be used to support the most vulnerable without jeopardising inflation goals.Additional steps are also needed to address several downside risks on the horizon. Importantly, we could see far greater turmoil in financial markets, including a sudden loss of appetite for emerging market assets that prompts large capital outflows, as investors retreat to safe assets.ENHANCE RESILIENCEIn this fragile environment, it is prudent to enhance resilience. Although emerging market central banks have stockpiled dollar reserves in recent years, reflecting lessons learned from earlier crises, these buffers are limited and should be used prudently.Countries must preserve vital foreign reserves to deal with potentially worse outflows and turmoil in the future. Those that are able should reinstate swap lines with advanced-economy central banks.Countries with sound economic policies in need of addressing moderate vulnerabilities should proactively avail themselves of the IMF's precautionary lines to meet future liquidity needs. Those with large foreign-currency debts should reduce foreign-exchange mismatches by using capital-flow management or macroprudential policies, in addition to debt management operations to smooth repayment profiles.In addition to fundamentals, with financial markets tightening, some countries are seeing signs of market disruptions such as rising currency hedging premia and local currency financing premia. Severe disruptions in shallow currency markets would trigger large changes in these premia, potentially causing macroeconomic and financial instability.In such cases, temporary foreign exchange intervention may be appropriate. This can also help prevent adverse financial amplification if a large depreciation increases financial stability risks, such as corporate defaults, due to mismatches.Finally, temporary intervention can also support monetary policy in the rare circumstances where a large exchange rate depreciation could de-anchor inflation expectations, and monetary policy alone cannot restore price stability.For the United States, despite the global fallout from a strong dollar and tighter global financial conditions, monetary tightening remains the appropriate policy while US inflation remains so far above target. Not doing so would damage central bank credibility, de-anchor inflation expectations, and necessitate even more tightening later—and greater spillovers to the rest of the world.That said, the Fed should keep in mind that large spillovers are likely to spill back into the US economy. In addition, as a global provider of the world's safe asset, the US could reactivate currency swap lines to eligible countries, as it extended at the start of the pandemic, to provide an important safety valve in times of currency market stress. These would usefully complement dollar funding provided by the Fed's standing Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility.The IMF will continue to work closely with our members to craft appropriate macroeconomic policies in these turbulent times, relying on our Integrated Policy Framework. Beyond precautionary financing facilities available for eligible countries, the IMF stands ready to extend our lending resources to member countries experiencing balance of payments problems.Gita Gopinath is the First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund.

Recognising the genocide strengthens the historical record, educates our fellow Americans, and lets would-be perpetrators know such crimes will not be tolerated or forgotten,"" Chabot, a Republican Party member, said in a tweet.""The Bangladesh Genocide of 1971 must not be forgotten. With help from my Hindu constituents in Ohio's First District, Ro Khanna and I introduced legislation to recognise that the mass atrocities committed against Bengalis and Hindus, in particular, were indeed a genocide,"" Chabot said.Khanna, a Democrat and the US Representative from California's 17th congressional district, tweeted that he along with Chabot introduced the first resolution commemorating the 1971 Bengali Genocide in which millions of ethnic Bengalis and Hindus were killed or displaced in one of the most forgotten genocides of ""our"" time.""There was a genocide. Millions of people were killed (in 1971) in what is now Bangladesh, and what was then East Pakistan. About 80 per cent of those millions that were killed were Hindus, Chabot, US Representative for Ohio's 1st congressional district,"" he said.""And it was, in my opinion, a genocide just like other genocides – like the Holocaust – happened. And there were others that have occurred, and this was one that, thus far, hasn't really been declared by definition. And we are working on this now,"" he said, reports PTI.The resolution has been welcomed by the Bangladeshi community.Saleem Reza Noor, whose family members were brutally murdered by armed Islamists in 1971, expressed relief after 51 years of despair.""Our genocide is finally getting recognition in the US Congress,"" Noor said, reports PTI.He expressed satisfaction as both Republicans and Democrats joined forces to introduce a historic resolution that has the potential to reshape the geopolitics of South Asia, Central Asia, and the Indo-Pacific.Priya Saha, executive director of the Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM), said: ""On this 51st anniversary of Bangladesh's independence, we hope that millions of people in Bangladesh who were systematically exterminated by the Pakistan army and their collaborators in 1971 will be formally memorialised.""Aroma Dutta, a member of Parliament from the Hindu community in Bangladesh whose grandfather and uncle were killed by the Pakistan Armed Forces, said: ""My grandfather, Dhirendra Nath Datta (85 years), along with his son, Dilip Datta (40 Years), were picked up by the brutal Pakistani Army on the 29th of March, 1971.""They were taken into the Mainamati Cantonment in Cumilla, brutally tortured for more than two weeks and murdered; their lifeless bodies were thrown into a ditch, never to be found. Until today, they lie in a mass grave,"" she said.""I want the killers to be punished for murdering innocent people, including the elderly, young women, and children,"" she said."

/business/economy/opinion/news/asia-sails-headwinds-rate-hikes-war-and-china-slowdown-3143256,"Asia sails into headwinds from rate hikes, war, and China slowdown","Asia's strong economic rebound early this year is losing momentum, with a weaker-than-expected second quarter. We have cut growth forecasts for Asia and the Pacific to 4 per cent this year and 4.3 per cent next year, which are well below the 5.5 per cent average over the last two decades. Despite this, Asia remains a relative bright spot in an increasingly dimming global economy.Waning momentum reflects three formidable headwinds, which may prove to be persistent:A sharp tightening of financial conditions, which is raising government borrowing costs and is likely to become even more constricting, as central banks in major advanced economies continue to raise interest rates to tame the fastest inflation in decades. Rapidly depreciating currencies could further complicate policy challenges.Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is still raging and continues to trigger a sharp slowdown of economic activity in Europe that will further reduce external demand for Asian exports.China's strict zero-COVID policy and the related lockdowns, which, coupled with a deepening turmoil in the real estate sector, has led to an uncharacteristic and sharp slowdown in growth, that in turn is weakening momentum in connected economies.BROAD SLOWDOWNAfter near-zero growth in the second quarter, China will recover modestly in the second half to reach full-year growth of 3.2 per cent and accelerate to 4.4 per cent next year, assuming pandemic restrictions are gradually loosened.In Japan, we expect growth to remain unchanged at 1.7 per cent this year before slowing to 1.6 per cent next year, weighed down by weak external demand. Korea's growth in 2022 was revised up to 2.6 per cent due to a strong second-quarter growth but revised down to 2 per cent in 2023 reflecting external headwinds. India's economy will expand, albeit more slowly than previously expected, by 6.8 per cent this year and 6.1 per cent in 2023, owing to a weakening of external demand and a tightening of monetary and financial conditions that are expected to weigh on growth.Southeast Asia is likely to enjoy a strong recovery. In Vietnam, which is benefitting from its growing importance in global supply chains, we expect 7 per cent growth and a slight moderation next year. The Philippines is forecast to see a 6.5 per cent expansion this year, while growth will top 5 per cent in Indonesia and Malaysia.Cambodia and Thailand will expand faster in 2023 on a likely pickup in foreign tourism. In Myanmar, which has endured a deep recession due to the coup and pandemic, growth this year is expected to stabilise at a low level amid continued unrest and suffering.The outlook is more challenging for other Asian frontier markets. Sri Lanka is still experiencing a severe economic crisis, though the authorities have reached an agreement with IMF staff on a programme that will help to stabilise the economy.In Bangladesh, the war in Ukraine and high commodity prices has dampened a robust recovery from the pandemic. The authorities have preemptively requested an IMF-supported programme that will bolster the external position, and access to the IMF's new Resilience and Sustainability Trust to meet their large climate financing need, both of which will strengthen their ability to deal with future shocks.High debt economies such as the Maldives, Lao P.D.R., and Papua New Guinea, and those facing refinancing risks, like Mongolia, are also facing challenges as the tide changes.We expect growth across Pacific Island countries to rebound strongly next year to 4.2 per cent from 0.8 per cent this year as tourism-based economies benefit from eased travel restrictions.INFLATION REMAINS ELEVATEDInflation now exceeds central bank targets in most Asian economies, driven by a mix of global food and energy prices, currencies falling against the US dollar, and shrinking output gaps. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has also risen and its persistence—driven by inflation expectations and wages—must be closely monitored.Meanwhile, the US dollar has strengthened against most major currencies as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and signals further hikes to come. Most Asian emerging market currencies have lost between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of their value against the dollar this year, while the yen has depreciated by more than 20 per cent. These recent depreciations have started passing through to core inflation across the region, and this may keep inflation high for longer than previously expected.Finally, spikes in global food and energy prices early this year threatened to abruptly raise the cost of living across the region, with particularly strong implications for the real incomes of lower-income households that spend more of their disposable income on these commodities.POLICY FOR CHALLENGING TIMESAmid lower growth, policymakers face complex challenges that will require strong responses.Central banks will need to persevere with their policy tightening until inflation durably falls back to target. Exchange rates should be allowed to adjust to reflect fundamentals, including the terms of trade—a measure of prices for a country's exports relative to its imports—and foreign monetary policy decisions.But if global shocks lead to a spike in borrowing rates unrelated to domestic policy changes and/or threaten financial stability or undermine the central bank's ability to stabilise inflation expectations, foreign-exchange interventions may become a useful part of the policy mix for countries with adequate reserves, alongside macroprudential policies.Countries should urgently consider improving their liquidity buffers, including by requesting access to precautionary instruments from the Fund for those eligible.Public debt has risen substantially in Asia over the past 15 years—particularly in the advanced economies and China—and rose further during the pandemic. Fiscal policy should continue its gradual consolidation to moderate demand alongside monetary policy, focused on the medium-term goal of stabilising public debt.Accordingly, measures to shield vulnerable populations from the rising cost of living will need to be well-targeted and temporary. In countries with high debt levels, support will need to be budget-neutral to maintain the path of fiscal consolidation. Credible medium-term fiscal frameworks remain an imperative.Beyond the short term, policies must focus on healing the damage inflicted by the pandemic and war. Scarring from the pandemic and current headwinds are likely to be sizable in Asia, in part because of elevated leverage among companies that will weigh on private investment and education losses from school closures that could erode human capital if remedial measures aren't taken today.Strong international cooperation is needed to prevent greater geoeconomic fragmentation and to ensure that trade aids growth. There is an urgent need for ambitious structural changes to boost the region's productive potential and address the climate crisis.Krishna Srinivasan is the director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the International Monetary Fund.  Shanaka Jayanath Peiris is the Asia and Pacific Department's Division Chief of Regional Studies."

Mega projects are being undertaken at the cost of thousands of crores of taka. But not a single project is completed on time. This proves that the feasibility of the projects is not being done properly,"" he said.Quader said where people do not have basic rights, mega projects are being undertaken only for looting. Mega project means mega looting.He said that the by-elections of Gaibandha-5 proved that fair elections are not possible under an authoritarian government.""Even if the Election Commission wants, a fair election will not be possible. Law enforcement agencies and administration turn irregularities into rules to please the government,"" said the JP chairman.The Jatiya Party chief also said that they have been opposing using EVMs in the elections because it is not possible to challenge the election result.""If a candidate is aggrieved, she/he cannot take legal action against the election result.

/sports/football/news/real-madrid-know-how-orchestrate-campaigns-win-the-ballon-dor-3143251,'Real Madrid know how to orchestrate campaigns to win the Ballon d'Or',"The director of France Football, Pascal Ferre, remains silent on the identity of the next winner of the Ballon d'Or, which will be known this Monday, and in the face of Karim Benzema's status as favourite, he spoke of how Real Madrid know how to orchestrate campaigns to propel their players towards the award.""Florentino Perez orchestrates the campaigns well, tacitly, without drifts, everything he does is authorised,"" Ferre said in an interview with EFE.The head of the magazine that has been awarding the prize since 1956 says that campaigns ""don't make you win, but they can make you lose when there is a bad message or a bad gesture"".""There are machines like Real Madrid that are very strong. Their intelligence is that they support a single player. For years it was Cristiano Ronaldo and now it's Karim Benzema. That prevents votes from being dispersed,"" he says.""They know how it works. It's no coincidence that they're the club that have won it the most times,"" says Ferre in the office he has occupied since 2005.Off the pitch
Ferre recalls that off-field reputation is also a criterion when awarding points, but does not believe that the conviction for complicity in blackmail handed down against Benzema should be an obstacle to him becoming the first Frenchman to win the award since Zinedine Zidane in 1998.""I think that has already been taken into account by the juries, but I don't think it is an essential element. The Ballon d'Or is not the Nobel Peace Prize, they have voted on eleven months of competition,"" he said.Messi's omission
 









For the first time in 15 years, Lionel Messi, winner of seven editions, does not appear among the candidates, ""a gigantic event in the history of the award"", according to Ferre, who considers that ""the Ballon d'Or is Messi and Messi is the Ballon d'Or"".
""His record is going to be very difficult to match, he is someone who embodies the Ballon d'Or well, because he combines individual and collective performance, but also a certain idea of showmanship and longevity,"" he says. He remembers the Argentinian being ""tremendously excited"" when he called him on the last two occasions to announce that he was the winner.
""In 2019 he told me that he had forgotten the pleasure of winning it (three years after the last one), he had realised that he missed it. In 2021 I had the impression that I was talking to a child,"" he says.
Cristiano's emotion

He also recalls Cristiano Ronaldo's excitement when he was announced in several editions and believes that the Portuguese ""has not digested being left behind his great rival"".
""It is a very important award for them. The Ballon d'Or is one of the few things you can't buy. It makes them humble in the face of this kind of reward, it makes them like children,"" he adds.
Messi and Ronaldo ""have been the protagonists of one of the most intense rivalries in the history of sport"", says Ferre, happy that the Ballon d'Or has helped to fuel it, while considering that it will be some time before a similar duel is repeated.
""There is a lot of talk about the rivalry between Mbappe and Haaland, but neither of them have won the Champions League. At Mbappe's age, Messi already had two Ballon d'Ors. If they want to establish a similar rivalry they have to start winning major trophies now. Messi and Ronaldo didn't take that long,"" he says.
Ferre is aware that the Ballon d'Or is not without controversy ""because everyone has their favourites"", but when he reviews the list of winners he believes that ""there is no one who has disgraced the award"".
Xavi and Iniesta, a scar

""I don't think anyone is missing from the list. It's obvious that there are some names missing. In my opinion there are three, Poland's Robert Lewandowski and Spain's Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta,"" he admits.
""For me it's a big scar, because (Xavi and Iniesta) are two players who I rank very highly and who embody football as the Ballon d'Or sees it. But in 2010 they were up against Messi and I think they paid for the fact that, in that Spanish national team, the votes were divided between many names, which reduced their support.""
He knows that, for many, Raul Gonzalez is another of those absent from the list of winners, but he believes that ""he is a step below"" and recalls that he never won the World Cup.
On Lewandowski, Ferre also regrets that the Pole did not win it in 2020, when he was the big favourite but France Football decided not to award it because of the pandemic.
""We did it out of a desire to be fair, not all the championships had stopped. Robert keeps asking me if I don't regret it, but I think we did the right thing,"" he says.
For a few days now, his phone has been ringing off the hook. ""Representatives, clubs, players... they want to know if they've won, it's inevitable.""
The winner of 2022 already knows that he will embrace the golden trophy next Monday. Ferre has already gone through the usual ceremony of announcing it in person at his home.
""We try to keep it as secret as possible. Sometimes we disguise ourselves so that no one sees us arrive. And we tell the winner not to tell his wife or children,"" he says.

/news/bangladesh/news/court-sets-oct-17-decide-charges-against-zubaida-3142906,Court sets Oct 17 to decide on charges against Zubaida,"A Dhaka court will decide on October 17 whether to accept the charges against Zubaida Rahman, wife of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, in a graft case.Judge Md Asaduzzaman of Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court on Thursday set the date after scrutinising case dockets and other relevant documents, said court sources.The HC on June 25 declared Tarique and Zubaida as ""fugitives"" and rejected their writ petitions challenging the filing and initiation of a Tk 4.82-crore graft case.The HC also withdrew the stay order on the case filed during the caretaker government in 2007 and directed the lower court concerned to complete the trial proceedings as early as possible.The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate of Dhaka was asked to send the case record to Dhaka Senior Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court within 10 days of receiving the order for holding its trial.Trial proceedings of Tarique was stayed on October 1 of 2007, following a writ petition filed by him, while trial proceedings against his mother-in-law Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu were quashed.                  On September 26, 2007, the Anti-Corruption Commission filed the case with Kafrul Police Station against Tarique, his wife Zubaida and her mother Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu for amassing assets worth Tk 4.82 crore through illegal means and concealing information of Tk 2.16 crore in their wealth statements."
/news/bangladesh/news/forest-faces-further-forays-3142986,A forest faces further forays,"The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) has taken an initiative to build a 5km road through the Ramu reserve forest, a move that forest officials and environmentalists say will bring disaster.LGED's Cox's Bazar office prepared a draft proposal involving Tk 22 crore for the planned road to connect Ramu upazila with Cox's Bazar city at the Marine Drive along the sea beach.But the LGED neither did an environmental assessment nor obtained permission from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to build the road through the heart of the reserve forest.In a letter, the Forest Department warned the LGED against the move, and the initiative has since been put on hold.The draft proposal, yet to be submitted for approval, comes only months after the government handed over 20 acres of the same reserve forest to the Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) for building a residential training facility.The handover on July 4 drew heavy criticism from environmentalists, who said the deal with BFF served a fresh blow to the fast-depleting forests in the region.Now, if the government goes ahead with the road construction, it will mean felling of thousands of trees. It will also cause irreparable damages to wildlife habitats and elephant corridors, forest officials said.The forest is a corridor and habitat for the endangered Asian Elephant in Cox's Bazar. It is also home to 117 tree species, 286 bird species and 26 mammal species including hoolock gibbon, leopard cat, fishing cat, tiger, Asian black bear, sloth bear and wild boar, according to Cox's Bazar Forest Department data.""Construction of such a structure is prohibited under the Forest Act. They cannot do it without the consent of the Forest Department,"" Sarwar Alam, Divisional Forest officer of Cox's Bazar South Forest Department, told The Daily Star.A joint study by the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (BELA) and Youth Environment Society found 45,990 acres of the 260,046-acre forestland in Cox's Bazar have been illegally occupied by 43,568 people and 696 public and private organisations over the last decade.Besides, 6,164 acres of forestland have been degraded due to the Rohingya influx while the government allotted 14,372 acres of forestland to several government organisations, according to the study published last year. To protect the environment and natural resources, the government in 1999 declared Cox's Bazar Sea Beach and parts of the Ramu reserve forest as an Ecologically Critical Area under the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995.Also, a 2002 circular of the Cabinet Division states that any organisation building any structures within a forest area must have clearance from the Forest Department.""But the LGED is yet to seek clearance from the forest and environment ministry in this regard,"" Sawrar said.Anisur Rahman, executive engineer of Cox's Bazar LGED, told The Daily Star they took the initiative on instructions of the Cox's Bazar deputy commissioner.""The DC informed us that an international football training centre will be built in Ramu reserve forest. Following this, we made a preliminary estimate for the road construction to facilitate communication between Ramu Upazila and Cox's Bazar city,"" he said.The 5km long and 18 feet wide road will stretch from Shahid ATM Zafar Alam Multi-Discipline Academy in Khuniapalong Union of Ramu upazila to Marine Drive adjacent to Cox's Bazar seashore, he said.He acknowledged that they did not assess the environmental impacts yet.""We have halted all activities after receiving a letter from the Forest Department telling us not to build the road through the reserve forest,"" he added.He said they would abandon the project if the Forest Department and other relevant authorities did not approve it.The forest minister and state minister did not respond to our calls and text messages.Cox's Bazar DC Md Mamunur Rashid said the decision to construct this road was made in 2016.""We verbally instructed the LGED to revive the initiative to make it easier for the foreign players and coaches coming to the international training facility of BFF in Ramu,"" he told The Daily Star.Forest officials in Cox's Bazar said construction of the road would only promote illegal settlements in the reserve forest and further shrink the elephant corridor.The Rohingya settlement has shut the Ukhia-Ghumdhum elephant corridor. Besides, the Panerchhra-Tulabagan corridor was damaged during the construction of Ramu Cantonment, which was completed in 2014, they said.Emran Ahmed, a conservator of the forest's wildlife management and nature conservation division, said there are still at least 63 elephants living within the Ramu corridor.""Construction of the road will destroy the elephant corridor. Elephants relocate locally as a result of habitat loss and reduced migration, which will result in more elephant-human conflicts,"" said Ahmed.Sharif Jamil, general secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolan (Bapa), said both public and private organisations are carrying out systematic deforestation in Cox's Bazar.""Infrastructure development that disregards the dangers of deforestation is nothing but a breach of Bangladesh's commitment to the Glasgow Leader Declaration made at COP 26,"" said Jamil.Bangladesh is among the 141 signatory countries that promised to end deforestation by 2030 in the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) in Glasgow last year."

India and Pakistan will face off in Melbourne on October 23 in the ICC T20 World Cup, which will be the third meeting between the two sides in 2022, with both of them having won one match each during the Asia Cup.India captain Rohit Sharma and Pakistan skipper Babar Azam were quizzed while addressing the captain's press conference today about the India-Pakistan rivalry and the importance of the match, but both of them downplayed the 'hype' surrounding the match.The International Cricket Council (ICC) organised a Captains' Day today, involving all 16 captains of the T20 World Cup 2022 teams ahead of the tournament opener on Sunday. During the event, the skippers posed for a group photo and talked to the media.After the press conference, Rohit and Babar, along with all the captains took part in the official photoshoot for the T20 World Cup, and fans couldn't keep calm after seeing the photos.While some fans compared the duo of Rohit and Babar to famous Bollywood film characters 'Karan and Arjun' portrayed by Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, others posted hilarious memes and compared the photo shoot to that of a pre-wedding photoshoot.Rohit and Babar seemed like two friends who just happen to play cricket for different countries. They were all praise for each other throughout but the bond between India and Pakistan was explained beautifully by them when one journalist asked about the conversations they have during tournaments.""Rohit Sharma is older than me. I try to take as much experience as possible from him as he has been playing for a long time,"" said Babar.The feel-good mood notwithstanding, Babar was fully aware of the importance of the match. ""Any match against India is always a high-intensity contest,"" said the 28-year-old. ""Fans also wait for them. On the field, we enjoy it a lot and give our 100 percent.""India skipper said, ""We understand the importance of the game (India vs Pakistan). But there is no point in talking about it all the time and creating that pressure within yourself.""Rohit further added, ""Whenever we (India and Pakistan) players meet, when we met at the Asia Cup, we talk about our families, ask about what's happening in our homes. We talk about life, what new car did you buy. That's all we talk about. That's all. From the interactions that I have had with Babar's teammates, we talk about such stuff only.""

/satireday/news/cow-escaping-proves-she-belongs-everyone-say-alleged-owners-3143076,"Cow escaping proves she belongs to everyone, say alleged owners","Nik, the biggest cow of the northern Chapasthani village of Gorubadha, escaped on Wednesday, bringing an abrupt halt to all the festivities surrounding Village Elder Day.Locals have said there was too much commotion on this particular Elder Day, which spooked the cow.""I mean there is always some commotion on the day, but this year it was too much, and it scared Nik,"" said Guy Tie, a local.It has caused an uproar because it was the first time in Gorubadha's history that Elder Day, which cannot take place without the village cow's ceremonial blessings, was halted.On Elder Day, villagers attend a ceremony where they nominate a village elder for another term. Traditionally the elders have been from one family, named The Family. After the nomination, the elder drinks the cow's milk.""But this year, without the cow, the elder won't be able to drink the milk. So, the ceremony cannot be completed,"" Badhon Chapa, the village's historian, said.Satireday learnt that a possible reason for the reported commotion was that this year, other families wanted their members to be nominated the village elder.Jamshed Palash, one of the members of another family who wanted to be nominated the elder, said the game was rigged and no one other than those from The Family could become an elder. ""The truth is Nik won't give milk for any other family. Although they won't admit it, The Family owns Nik,"" said Palash.The Family's elder nominee Mamunur Hossain said Nik did not belong to them. ""In fact, that Nik escaped on Elder Day, denying me victory, means that she belongs to everyone.""But we are still trying to find her, because if not us, then who?""A fringe conspiracy theorist of the village, Badrul Nasir Pasha, said Nik's escape was a deliberate ploy by The Family to prove to everyone that the cow was not theirs and therefore Elder Day was not rigged. But no one paid him any heed, as he rarely attended Elder Days in the past and the villagers had forgotten about him.Meanwhile, the CCTV minister in the capital said they could not trust CCTV footage of Elder Day happenings in Gorubadha village and so could not say anything about whether there was too much commotion. He blamed Nik for being a cow.  "
/supplements-old/news/support-child-education-through-csr-speakers-emphasise-csr-dialogue-rangpur-3143321,"Support child education through CSR, speakers emphasise at CSR Dialogue: Rangpur","Participants in an online discussion suggested that CSR initiatives should work for advancing child education in remote and hard-to-reach areas to ensure basic education for every child. The event titled 'CSR Dialogue: Rangpur' was held on October 8, 2022. It was part of a joint initiative of The Daily Star and CSR Window known as ""A Better Tomorrow CSR Summit and Awards"". The annual nationwide programme aims to create dialogues for future development and sustainability solutions and recognise corporations for their innovative and world-class CSR initiatives, social projects and programmes implemented for sustainable impacts on society.Dr Shazzat Rahat Hossain, Project Lead of Spreeha, discussed how rural people suffer from the lack of adequate health facilities during emergencies. He along with his team is working on a project named 'Sneho Mobile Health' to provide emergency health services to rural people. According to their model, rural people will be able to contact doctors through Community Health Workers (CHW), and the doctors will issue e-prescriptions. Currently, they are running the project in Gaibandha, Meherpur, and Satkhira. They have also developed a database of patients which helps them identify what kind of health services the rural people need most. Dr Shazzat sought support from CSR initiatives to upscale their project and provide support to a large number of people. K M Ali Samrat, Executive Director of Participatory Advancement Social Service (PASS), suggested that CSR initiatives should invest more in tree plantation projects. He identified two open areas in Rangpur – Nasnia Bill and Chikli Bill – where large-scale plantation projects can be undertaken. He also pointed out that there are remote areas in the Rangpur division where children lack proper access to education. He requested CSR initiatives to work in those areas. S M Nazmul Ahsan, AGM of  CSR at Epyllion Group, talked about his company's eye care project 'Noyon Tori' under which a vehicle equipped with state-of-the-art eye care services roams rural areas and provides free eye treatment to poor people. They also provide free prescription eyeglasses to patients. He also talked about Epyllion Group's Kheya Academy which provides education and skill development training to young people. Velayat Ali Ahsan, Divisional Leaf Manager of BAT Bangladesh, appreciated Spreeha's 'Sneho Mobile Health' project and suggested that it should be upscaled at the national level. He also talked about several CSR initiatives of BAT Bangladesh including Afforestation, Renewable Energy Project and Skill Development Training for Rural Women. 
 
Alhajj Mostafizur Rahman Mostafa, Honorable Mayor of Rangpur City Corporation, suggested that telemedicine services like 'Sneho Mobile Health"" need to be taken to a large number of people through adequate financial support and campaign. He also requested CSR initiatives to invest in education, health and tree plantation projects in the Rangpur City Corporation area.The online session was moderated by Ahsan Rony, Co-Founder of CSR Window."
/sports/cricket/news/soumya-shoriful-make-world-cup-squad-tigers-head-australia-3143146,"Soumya, Shoriful make World Cup squad as Tigers head to Australia","The form of a few players had raised concerns as Bangladesh gear up for the T20I World Cup in Australia, which starts tomorrow although the Tigers will not play until October 24, and with reports of imminent changes to the World Cup squad, chief selector Minhajul Abedin spoke yesterday noon about that aspect before flying for Australia.Late yesterday, the cut-off date for any final changes, the BCB announced that Soumya Sarkar and Shoriful Islam had replaced Sabbir Rahman and Mohammad Saifuddin in the World Cup squadAlthough the team management have run several experiments recently to fine-tune their combinations, the performances of Sabbir, Saifuddin, Najmul Hossain Shanto and Mustafizur Rahman had been of concern.Sabbir and Mehedi Hasan Miraz opened the innings starting with the Asia Cup match against Sri Lanka but the opening combination was changed quite a few times during the tri-nation series in New Zealand.Sabbir appeared in the first game of the tri-nation series against Pakistan but was dropped for the rest of the tournament. Shanto and Soumya Sarkar were tried in the opening slots as Mehedi also made way following the second game in the series.Sabbir, who scored just 31 runs in four matches since his return to the national team, visibly underperformed. Although the chief selector talked to the media before the changes were announced, he said the responsibility of settling into the side lay with the players first and foremost.""We had a plan from before the Asia Cup about which player would be played where. From that regard, we discussed using Sabbir at the top. You also have to look at the player, not just the team management and selectors. Players have the most responsibility because they are the ones out on the field. In the T20 format, there is no scope to blink. Concentration and self-assessment are very important. If a player can't prepare himself of his own accord, it's very difficult to settle [in the team],"" Minhajul said.Soumya has not looked very settled either in his two matches so far, struggling with the pace. But technical consultant Sridharan Sriram had backed his intent a day before and yesterday Soumya replaced Sabbir. There was no clarity on how much the team management could judge from his performances as was indicated in Minhajul's words.""It's not good to judge a player based on two matches. But given the situation, it's difficult to focus on someone in a big way. We have to ensure we play well and that our approach is positive.""Meanwhile, Saifuddin had leaked runs with the ball and Shoriful, despite initially being a stand-by, impressed just enough.Minhajul highlighted that Saifuddin's performances were ""disappointing"" and that his injury situation was still a worry. ""All the players are being monitored and the team management is working hard to make them fit. Among the pool of pacers that we have, Shoriful is one of the best,"" Minhajul said.Both Sabbir and Saifuddin will now return to Bangladesh from New Zealand while the World Cup squad head to Auckland from Christchurch this morning before flying to Brisbane.Skipper Shakib Al Hasan will attend the captains' meet for photoshoots in Melbourne before joining the side in Brisbane tomorrow. As Minhajul had wished, a settled squad will now begin the World Cup grind in Australia."
/tech-startup/science-gadgets-and-tech/tech-news/news/musk-says-spacex-cannot-indefinitely-fund-starlink-ukraine-3143186,Musk says SpaceX cannot indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine,"Elon Musk said on Friday his rocket company SpaceX cannot indefinitely fund its Starlink internet service in Ukraine, which has helped the country's civilians and military stay online during the war with Russia.Musk's comment on Twitter came after a media report that SpaceX had asked the Pentagon to pay for the donations of Starlink. The billionaire has been in online fights with Ukrainian officials over a peace plan he put forward which Ukraine says is too generous to Russia.A senior defense official told reporters on Friday that the US Department of Defense would not confirm that ongoing talks with the company were related to payment, but said the Pentagon was ""continuing to talk to SpaceX and other companies about SATCOM capabilities.""The Starlink communications platform has been very ""exceptionally effective on the battlefield"" allowing Ukrainians to support multiple device connections in the combat environment, a senior US military official said.The billionaire who runs Tesla said Starlink says he spends nearly $20 million a month for maintaining satellite services in Ukraine. He recently said that SpaceX had spent about $80 million to enable and support Starlink there.""SpaceX is not asking to recoup past expenses, but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely *and* send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to 100X greater than typical households. This is unreasonable,"" Musk wrote on Twitter on Friday.""We've also had to defend against cyberattacks & jamming, which are getting harder,"" Musk wrote.CNN reported on Thursday that SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon last month saying it could not continue to fund the Starlink service in Ukraine and it may have to stop funding it unless the US military gives the company tens of millions of dollars a month.SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.Musk activated Starlink, satellite broadband service, in Ukraine in late February after internet services were disrupted because of Russia's invasion. SpaceX has since given it thousands of terminals. read moreStarlink has been a key communications tool for Ukrainian forces in their fight against Russian forces.On Friday, an advisor to the Ukrainian president said Kyiv will find a solution to keep the Starlink internet service working in Ukraine. And Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime minister, backed him up on Telegram.""Starlink terminals were working, are working and will work. Do not worry,"" he wrote, adding a smiley face emoji at the end.Ukraine said this week Starlink services helped restore energy and communications infrastructure in critical areas after more than 100 Russian cruise missile attacksRussia calls its intervention in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" and says it does not target civilians.Musk drew widespread criticism from Ukrainians over his peace plan in which he proposed that Ukraine permanently cede the Crimea region to Russia, that new referendums be held under UN auspices to determine the fate of Russian-controlled territory, and that Ukraine agree to neutrality.Ukraine says it will never agree to cede land taken by force, and lawful referendums cannot be held in occupied territory where many people have been killed or driven out.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was among those who criticized Musk's proposal. read moreUkraine's outgoing ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, also condemned the plan in tweet that told Musk in profane terms to go away.Musk, responding to a post referring to the fate of the Starlink service and the ambassador's remark, said: ""We're just following his recommendation.""Republican US Representative Adam Kingzinger cited Musk's comments on Twitter, writing ""if there was ever proof that @elonmusk is playing games this is it. I'm not sure someone like this can be trusted to any longer do business with our government.""While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology like Starlink can provide internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve areas where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology can also be a critical backstop when natural disasters disrupt communication."
/opinion/views/open-dialogue/news/what-bangladesh-needs-consider-devaluing-the-taka-further-3143341,What Bangladesh needs to consider before devaluing the taka further,"One of the hottest global news items right now is the effect of the dollar's strength on local currencies and on everyday life. Bangladesh loosened its grip on its currency and allowed the taka to weaken to a record low to preserve dwindling dollars. Like many other countries in the developing world, Bangladesh is dependent on imports, and the high cost of the US dollar is creating a drain on dollar reserves and pushing up the price of essential goods. There is hardly a single item in the country that has not been affected.The US dollar, one of four reserve currencies in the global financial system, is now at its highest in 20 years. The strong dollar and high interest rates in the US, UK, and other countries are ""wreaking havoc"" around the world, exporting inflation, forcing developing countries to raise their own interest rates, and leading to capital outflows. Bangladesh, like others, may soon face difficulties in the sphere of debt repayment.Although Bangladesh Bank (BB) puts the official dollar rate at Tk 95, it reached its highest peak in history in the kerb or open market when it hit Tk 119.9 on August 10, and the dollar rate difference between the Bangladeshi interbank channel and kerb market became Tk 25. The trade deficit widened to USD 27.2 billion in the July 2021-May 2022 period as imports surged to nearly USD 59 billion, while exports rose at a slower pace to USD 31.5 billion.The government and monetary authorities now face a dilemma. How much should they adjust the taka to dollar exchange rate, and how fast? The decision has been up in the air for quite a while, and economists, business groups, and other stakeholders have joined the chorus, sometimes offering divergent views on the matter.The negative effect of any devaluation is felt immediately by importers, who now have to recover higher costs of the items they sell by raising prices or taking a cut on their profits. If you are in a competitive market, where imported goods vie with domestic products (as is the case of many electronic goods), the higher cost of imported goods results in reduced demand for the imported item and boosts the sale of local substitutes. The moral of this story is, devaluation helps domestic industries and facilitates ""import substitution,"" providing a boost for exporters.Local reactions to fast and steep devaluation are expected to be mixed. ""Devaluation of taka should be gradual"" was the call made by Mostafa Kamal of Meghna Group of Industries. He and some other businesspeople have cautioned the government against drastic action, arguing currency depreciation might ""have a huge impact on every sphere of the economy and life.""His view was echoed by many others I spoke to. One businessman, who sells Microsoft products, reported that the price of an MS Windows license has already jumped since March 2022 by Tk 3,000-4,000. The members of the FBCCI are openly voicing their concerns regarding the increase in the interbank price of the dollar from Tk 84 to Tk 108.Domestically, inflation has caught families with fixed budgets completely off-guard. Even utilities are becoming costlier. After the gas price hike, a proposal to raise electricity tariffs by 66 percent has been submitted. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Committee has suggested a 58 percent raise for per unit power.Former BB governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed, on the other hand, joined many economists in calling for quick action on adjusting the value of the taka against the dollar to reflect market realities. ""It is time to think about inflation, our competitiveness and exchange rate,"" he said recently. ""The wait-and-see policy will not bring any good. Crises snowballed in Sri Lanka over the last four to five years as the country did not act properly to set things right. I wish Bangladesh will not walk the same path.""Nonetheless, a careful assessment shows that devaluation will hurt the average consumers sharply and will only add marginally to our export earnings. One RMG exporter who was in the US recently told me that the recent down-swing in exports is transitional and will pick up once the war in Ukraine reaches a steady state and US importers take stock of market conditions, particularly the inventory on hand.Bangladesh is dependent on imports; during the first eight months of 2022, it imported goods worth USD 50.2 billion. Of this amount, essential commodities account for 72 percent: USD 5.67 billion for food commodities, 4.41 billion for intermediate goods, 19.28 billion for industrial raw materials and 4.46 billion for petroleum products.The taka has been devalued against the dollar in seven steps this year. This measure adds to the cost of business. The Bangladesh Bank has resisted mounting pressures on the taka for a while, but it is increasingly running out of options. The exchange rate of the dollar against the Bangladeshi taka was Tk 84.9 on January 1, 2020. On August 15, 2022, the rate went up and is currently Tk 95, with a decline of the value of the taka by 12 percent. While this is a significant decrease, the currency has held up better than many others. Currencies of the world's top economies, as well as those of our neighbouring countries, have lost their value against the US dollar. India has spent more than 10 percent of its reserves on interventions in the foreign exchange market, which are down USD 27 billion.There is a silver lining in this bleak scenario. The BB has taken several steps to stem demand for foreign exchange and curb inflation – by raising the repo rate, raising the deposit margin on letters of credit of imports of non-essential items, and restrictions on imports of luxury items. The government has decided to go slow on major projects to manage the import bill of construction materials and hardware.Going forward, Bangladesh Bank can consider a policy regime where exchange rate interventions will not be needed on a regular basis. The Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman had proposed a system where a currency can float a little above and a little below a target rate within a narrow band. This system, also known as ""broad target zones,"" and followed by China among others, would require market intervention only if the market rate drifts far away from the ""fix,"" an exchange rate set by Bangladesh Bank.Dr Abdullah Shibli is an economist and works for Change Healthcare, Inc., an information technology company. He also serves as senior research fellow at the US-based International Sustainable Development Institute (ISDI).

Barring the first series when she made 104, Koly scored more than 105 out of 109 in each of the three following series (106.3, 105.1 and 105.4).Those performances saw her in the fourth position overall at the conclusion of the fourth series.But the slightest dip in her scores in the final two series proved costly. She secured 104.1 and 104.3 points, which meant she fell narrowly short of becoming the first Bangladeshi to qualify for the final of the ISSF World Championships.Koly would have entered the final had she scored just a single point more in either of the last two series, but she had to settle for 629.2, ruing that one point even more after five shooters finished above her by virtue of decimal points.Earlier in the day, young shooter Sajida Haque scored a career-best 627.5 to finish 36th while Nafisa Tabasum bettered her previous score and made 621.6 to finish 94th among the 135 shooters.In the men's 10m air rifle event, Rabbi Hasan Munna and Mohamed Ali almost kept their Baku World Cup performance intact, finishing 55th and 80th respectively out of 114 shooters.

/news/bangladesh/news/bhairab-struggles-survival-3142936,Bhairab struggles for survival,"Due to the mindless dumping of waste, rampant river-grabbing by influential persons and reluctance of authorities to take appropriate steps, Bhairab river -- one of the major waterbodies of the country -- continues to suffer.Both sides of the river's 37-km stretch -- from Rupsha ghat of Khulna city to Nowapara Bazar ghat of Jashore's Avaynagar -- have fallen victim to encroachers, who are turning the river into a canal and reducing its navigability.These grabbers have built business establishments, factories, jute mills and depots, chemical industries, jetties, tanneries, and sand and coal selling centres by the rivers.There are about 350 industrial units in the region. Among them, 230, including 54 jute mills, four power-plants, soybean mills, 22 shrimp processing units and cement factories, are on the riverbank.The waste generated from these establishments is discharged directly into the river.Industrial units at Rupsha, Khalishpur, Daulatpur, Shiromony BSCIC in Khulna, Rajghat, and Nowapara of Jashore are posing a serious threat to the river's existence.During a recent visit to both sides of the river -- from Custom ghat to Nowapara Bazar -- this correspondent saw at least 500 establishments there.There were also some jetties set up in the river, reducing its navigability. Grabbers also installed cranes there to facilitate loading and unloading of goods from cargo vessels.There are many government and private institutions that depend on Bhairab for their shipments. Khulna Shipyard, BNS Titumir (Bangladesh Navy), BIWTA ghat, Forest ghat, Khulna Newsprint Mills, Khulna Hardboard Mills, nine state-owned jute mills, four power plants, three state-owned oil depots, and over 200 private jute mills have been built on the banks of Bhairab following due procedures.Besides, near the Khulna Boro Bazar, over 250 toilets have been set up by the river.Paran Saha (76), a hardware trader of Khulna Baro Bazar, said, ""Authorities like WDB, BIWTA, city corporation, Khulna district administration and police are not sincere enough to protect the river from polluters and grabbers.""Moufarsher Alam Lenin, a private jute employee of Digholia upazila, said over 40 private jute industries throw their waste into Bhairab. Many owners have also built structures on the riverbed.Every day, over 300 cargo vessels carry goods and oil from Jashore's Nowapara to different parts of the country along the river. On their way, they pollute the river by dumping waste and discharging chemicals, said locals and green activists.Ismail Morol, a trader in Nowapara Stone Ghat, said the planned dredging in Nowapara river port area did not bear any fruit due to mindless waste dumping.Prof Dilip Kumar Datta of Khulna University's environmental science department, who conducted a study on the quality of Bhairab's water, said, ""Once the 160-km Bhairab used to be rich with aquatic life. However, industrialisation, unplanned urbanisation, increasing population, and dumping of waste are deteriorating its water quality.''""It seems like we are adamant to kill our rivers. At least 20 large drains of Khulna City Corporation directly discharge liquid waste into Bhairab,"" he added.Contacted, Ashraf Hossain, joint director of Khulna BIWTA, said, ""We have already identified 1,274 structures from Labonchhara area of the city to BIWTA ghat area and submitted the list to the administration and mayor.""""First, the district administration will file cases against the grabbers and then we will conduct drives to free the river,"" he said.Masud Parvez, assistant director of Nowapara river port, said, ""We already evicted over 24 jetties in the last two months. Most of the grabbers are influential and exercise their power when faced with consequences.""Imdadul Haque, deputy director of Department of Environment, Khulna, said due to workforce shortage, they cannot monitor all the industries properly.""We are concerned about the issue and have conducted drives as well to free the river,"" he added."

/middle-east/news/22-killed-turkey-mine-blast-3143171,Death toll from Turkey mine blast now 41,"Rescuers on Saturday found the body of the last missing miner at a coal mine in northern Turkey, bringing the death toll to 41 from a methane blast the previous day.The blast ripped through the mine near the small coal mining town of Amasra on Turkey's Black Sea coast shortly before sunset on Friday.Shortly after his arrival at the site on Saturday afternoon, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that the last missing person had been found dead.""Our priority was to find the miners in the gallery. We finally reached the last one. He also died, bringing the number of deaths to 41,"" he said, ending rescue operations more than 20 hours after the deadly explosion.Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu earlier said 58 miners had survived the blast, ""either by themselves or thanks to rescuers"".He said 28 people had been injured as a result of the blast.Television images late on Friday showed anxious crowds -- some with tears in their eyes -- congregating around a damaged white building near the entrance to the pit in search of news of their friends and loved ones.Erdogan earlier vowed on Twitter that the incident will be thoroughly investigated.Most initial information about those trapped inside was coming from workers who had managed to climb out relatively unharmed.But Amasra mayor Recai Cakir said many of those who survived had suffered ""serious injuries"".Turkey's Maden Is mining workers' union attributed the blast to a build-up of methane gas.But other officials said it was premature to draw definitive conclusions over the cause of the accident.Rescuers sent in reinforcements from surrounding villages to help in the search and rescue.Television footage showed paramedics giving oxygen to the miners who had climbed out, then rushing them to the nearest hospitals.The local governor said a team of more than 70 rescuers had managed to reach a point in the pit some 250 metres below.Turkey's AFAD disaster management service said the initial spark that caused the blast appeared to have come from a malfunctioning transformer.It later withdrew that report and said methane gas had ignited for ""unknown reasons"".The local public prosecutor's office said it was treating the incident as an accident and launching a formal investigation.Turkey suffered its deadliest coal mining disaster in 2014 when 301 workers died in a blast in the western town of Soma."
/star-literature/news/no-home-or-land-no-country-no-earth-plight-the-refugees-3143011,"“No Home or Land, No Country, No Earth”: Plight of the Refugees","""War is vast. It reaches across the horizon, loftier and older than peace. Killing came before war, but it might also be that refuge preceded war. It got attached to war like a child holding on to its mother's dress with one hand, the other waving to those it does not know. The refugee: a flute weeping over its original image before there was a camp.""—Ever Since I Did Not Die, Ramy Al-Asheq""Refugees are people who have fled war, violence, conflict or persecution and have crossed an international border to find safety in another country,"" says a UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) report. Very often, the report reaffirms, these people are forced to flee with nothing but clothes on their backs – and there are more than 27 million of them! It is happening right now in Ukraine, among the Rohingyas, in the Middle East and in more places.Recently, Lesya Bakun, a Ukrainian refugee described how she had to hide from bomb blasts in Kharkiv when the war started. She described the experience in an interview: ""You hide in a self-created bomb shelter while the shelling continues. When it stops, you sit there for some time, trembling and unsure; and by the time you get your guts together to go buy some food or supplies … the shelling begins again, and you cannot leave. You just sit at home, frozen, in the constant state of crippling fear."" Lesya managed to flee and find refuge in neighbouring Lithuania and then to Poland. But her cousin who defended the factory of Azvotal is now a prisoner of war; ""taken by the Russians."" She had relatives in Mariupol and all their homes were erased out of existence.And yet, there is another group of people in Asia whose land has been taken away — the Rohingyas of Arakans. Technically indigenous, they had been in Myanmar for hundreds of years. In the golden age of Akbar, the second volume of Ain-ee-Akbari, a manifesto written in Persian around 1590, and later translated to English, gives out:""You hide in a self-created bomb shelter while the shelling continues. When it stops, you sit there for some time, trembling and unsure; and by the time you get your guts together to go buy some food or supplies … the shelling begins again, and you cannot leave. You just sit at home, frozen, in the constant state of crippling fear."" Lesya managed to flee and find refuge in neighbouring Lithuania and then to Poland.""You hide in a self-created bomb shelter while the shelling continues. When it stops, you sit there for some time, trembling and unsure; and by the time you get your guts together to go buy some food or supplies … the shelling begins again, and you cannot leave. You just sit at home, frozen, in the constant state of crippling fear."" Lesya managed to flee and find refuge in neighbouring Lithuania and then to Poland.""To, the south east of Bengal is a large country called Arkung (or Aracan) to which the Bunder (or port) of Chittagong properly belongs. Here are plenty of elephants, but great scarcity of horses, also camels and asses are very high priced: neither cows nor buffaloes are found in this country, but there are animals of a middle species between those, whose milk the people drink, they are pied and of various colours. Their religion has no kind of agreement either with the Mahommedan or Hindoo. Twin brothers and sisters may intermarry, and only mother and son are prohibited from it. They pay implicit obedience to the will of their priests...""Now, the descendants of these people live devoid of a home in refugee camps. The Rakhine people are said to be ""stateless."" In her short story, ""The Magic Staff,"" based on her experiences with such camps, writer Shaheen Akhtar describes their plight in the words of a child refugee: ""What sort of justice was this? No one would remain – no father or mother, sister or brother, no home or land, no country, no earth. What was his fault? Why did he have to spend his life at a camp – like a cockroach under a tarp?""The child had been sent to 'safety' by his grandmother, the 'safety' of a refugee camp where he found himself trapped and alone. His plight is no different from Lesys Bakun's. Ramy Al Asheq, the Palestinian-Syrian poet born in a refugee camp, wrote on his own experiences and thoughts in his book, Ever Since I Did Not Die:The camp is necessary, sometimes, for remembering that the lands across the river dropped off the face of the map when we weren't looking. The map: geography on paper, its borders drawn by the tank and the mortar shell for eternity. The mortar: a tiny cosmic explosion that re-arranges habitats by the whims of whoever launches it. One night, the mortar launcher awakened superstition from its sleep and dragged it away with an F-16 saying, ""I cannot exist . . . unless there is a refugee.""Al Asheq makes me wonder, are weapons dependent on the existence of refugees?More than seven decades ago, a war was ended by the deployment of a weapon that annihilated Man and Nature – the atom bomb. Did these bombs create refugees? Or, just destruction? There are survivors – and they recall the horrors and some at least plead for peace, peace so that there are no more refugees. The daughter of such a survivor, Kathleen Hilliker Burkinshaw, wrote in The Last Cherry Blossom, about the violence and the horror as well as in a bid to emphasise how Japanese are much the same as Americans, with similar concerns. While her book has been taken up by the UN as part of their peace keeping effort, Burkinshaw tells us how the scars linger: ""I lived with the scars of the atomic bombing during my childhood watching/reacting to the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) effects on my Mom and I still live with it each day with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (chronic, progressive neuro pain disease that affects the sympathetic nervous system). Doctors have said that the damage to my immune system from the radiation my mom was exposed to from the atomic bomb, attributed to this.""What does such a survivor have to do with refugees? They are perhaps, more scarred physically, than the refugees in camps described by Al Asheq or Lesya Bakun. But are the refugees on the run any better off? It is difficult to ignore the pain and emotional scars of Al Ahseq and Bakun for not having homes. They are both comparatively young. But if you lose your home in your mature years – say you are sixty – can you restart a new life in a country where the local residents see you as a threat or a competition for sharing resources?Then there is a new label cropping up these days– climate refugees or people who have lost their homes to climate change. A report made by the Ecological Threat Register predicts, ""Over one billion people live in 31 countries where the country's resilience is unlikely to sufficiently withstand the impact of ecological events by 2050, contributing to mass population displacement.""In a world that finds it hard to accept or tolerate differences, that is still unable to get over the hatred fanned hundreds of years ago by historical divides, how will a flood of such refugees be accommodated? Perhaps, it is time to evolve towards a world painted by visionaries and change our mindsets to become more accepting and tolerant, to paint anew a beautiful world for the future of our progeny.Mitali Chakravarty is the founding editor of Borderless Journal."
/news/world/usa/news/imminent-revival-iran-nuke-deal-unlikely-3143056,Imminent revival of Iran nuke deal unlikely,"The United States has ruled out any imminent revival of the Iranian nuclear deal, issuing a downbeat assessment of long-stalled talks over the 2015 accord as unrest continues to rage across the Islamic republic over the the death of a woman in police custody for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.The landmark JCPOA deal has been in tatters since then-president Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018 and Iran later backed away from some of its own commitments.On-off talks have been underway since 2021 to revive the deal, which gave Iran much-needed sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program.""It's not that we don't want to see the JCPOA reimplemented, we of course do. We're just not in a position where... that's a likely outcome anytime in the near future,"" White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters.""What we're focused on is holding the (Iran) regime accountable for what they are doing to these innocent political protesters.""His comments come after Iran's ultra-conservative President Ebrahim Raisi on Thursday again accused arch-enemy the United States of seeking to destabilise the Islamic republic.""Following the failure of America in militarisation and sanctions, Washington and its allies have resorted to the failed policy of destabilisation,"" he said.Nearly four weeks after Masha Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was detained in Tehran for ""inappropriate attire"", the protests show no sign of abating in a bold challenge to Iran's clerical rulers, even if the unrest does not seem close to toppling them.The unrest has underlined pent-up frustrations over freedoms and rights in Iran, with many women joining in.Human rights groups say that Iran's bloody crackdown on the protests has already claimed at least 108 lives.The government has described the protests as a plot by Iran's enemies including the United States, accusing armed dissidents – among others – of violence in which at least 20 members of the security forces have been reportedly killed. The West has condemned the crackdown on protesters and slapped additional sanctions on Tehran. In August, the European Union submitted a final draft of a modified nuclear text for the 2015 agreement, but there are key sticking points between Tehran and Washington and the UN nuclear watchdog.President Joe Biden is ""committed to not allowing Iran to achieve a nuclear weapons capability,"" Kirby said.""The president still believes that a diplomatic way forward is the best way forward to achieve that outcome.""At this time, the Iranians have come back with unreasonable demands, many of which have nothing to do with the deal itself.""In contrast, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said earlier this month that the deal could still be revived and that work was ongoing."

Similar rallies have been planned in other divisional headquarters to drum up support in the run up to the next election expected to be held late next year or in early 2024.The BNP will conclude the divisional rallies through a mass gathering in Dhaka city on December 10."
/star-literature/news/fakir-lalon-shah-lighthouse-the-unreal-bazaar-the-blind-3143016,Fakir Lalon Shah: A Lighthouse in the Unreal Bazaar of the Blind,"He spoke of women on equal terms at a time when women were not even people in the country where he lived (and they still are not—neither in the land of Lalon nor in the world that we proudly claim as ours. The world still belongs to men and will be so until they destroy it with their 'manly' hands. This however is a separate issue, which is why I have kept it in the veil of parenthesis here). Lalon not only avowed respect for women but also took his ideas beyond gender binaries. And the most unreal thing about him is that he valued human existence more than he valued religion specific rituals and conducts, and was inclined to find the God/Good in every human soul. He could neither read nor write, and yet he was the one who knew. I find it  simply impossible for this man to be a part of a reality that fed on willful blindness and discrimination of all sorts. And yet, there he was, a centenarian, standing stout against all odds, in defiance of all the androcentric and egotistic superficialities of religions and social customs, singing his songs of the soul.There was not one but at least three popular stories regarding Lalon's birth and early age. According to one story, he was a Hindu youth, who fell ill with small pox during a pilgrimage and was left ""dead"" by the roadside. The 'dead' man was brought back to life by a Muslim family, who nursed him back to health. Upon returning home, Lalon found out that his family had already performed his funeral by completing his 'sraddha,' the dispatch ceremony for his departed soul. The dead man Lalon's death sentence doubled up since his second life was given to him by Muslims. The outcast youth left home and established an 'akhra' in a nearby place, where he lived the life of a baul, surrounded by his disciples.Lalon was not real. A man who had more than three birthing stories and was reborn more than once can't be real. He was either Hindu or Muslim, or both—or neither. Nobody knew who he was, where he was from, or how old he was. The average life expectancy from 12th to 19th century was fifty five, but this unreal man is believed to have lived an impossibly long life—covering the life span of two people. He was rumored to have either walked on his 100 years old feeble feet to visit the dashing zamindar Tagore (who was in his early thirties), or sat still for God knows how long for the other Tagore brother to draw a sketch of him. Lalon was not real. A man who had more than three birthing stories and was reborn more than once can't be real. He was either Hindu or Muslim, or both—or neither.

He was rumored to have either walked on his 100 years old feeble feet to visit the dashing zamindar Tagore (who was in his early thirties), or sat still for God knows how long for the other Tagore brother to draw a sketch of him. In another story, the orphan Lalon was adopted by a man named Siraj Sain, who became his guru in the matters of music and spiritual lesson. The third story puts him in Nabadwip of West Bengal, where a youth named Lalon became a foster son of a Kayastha woman named Padmabati. In all the stories, he was depicted as a youth with charismatic personality, with the power to win the hearts of anyone who came  to know him. This man of many births lived his life in search of the eternal truth and died his final death while singing his songs of devotion. According to one description (noted by Mobarak Hossain Khan in his Lalon Shamagra, published by the Bangla Academy in 2007), he spent his last day on earth singing all night long with his disciples, and breathed his last at around eight in the morning. His last words to his disciples were, ""I'm going now."" But he was never gone—this unreal man. More than a hundred years after his death, we are still mesmerized by the magnanimity of his humanistic philosophy. He dreamt of a society where there would be no division and difference among people. ""When will such a society be created/ In which there will be no difference /Between Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists Christians, or race and caste?"" Lalon ended the song the following way:""No one will chant forReligion, race, class, or casteLalon Fakir asks in earnest,'Who will show me such a day?'"" (author's translation)Lalon  did not let his identity get branded by any religious or sectarian tropes. He rejected everything that binds and accepted everything that frees the human spirit. He assimilated in his songs the core ideas from the Vedic, Upanishadic, Vaishnavite, Buddhist, Tantric, and the Islamic Sufi philosophy. In hundreds of songs, he dealt with the issues of religion, gender, class, caste, nature, the ontology of human body and spirit, along with the origin of God and/or the Supreme Soul. A man of no knowledge, he became the lighthouse of wisdom, singing for unity, equality, respect, and peaceful coexistence. Even though he was influenced by the spiritual message, the tantric practices,  and the stylistic structure of the Charjapadas, Lalon refused the overtly sexualized symbolism of the female body of the Tantric tradition. His was a  somewhat pangender view in which he glorified the woman as an individual and as an inherent pair of a man's inner self. In many of his songs, he dealt with the image of the devotee as a feminine form of the [masculine] self. Take for example the song in which he sings, ""will the guru let me stay by his foot as a maid?"" or the one where the devotee regrets for not having the chance to serve his guru as his maid:""The yearnings of my heartMy hopes were not fulfilledI wanted to sit by his feetAnd serve him as his maidImpeding it, my Fate made me suffer in the world."" (author's translation)Lalon is always a thing of mystery to me. An enigma. Or maybe a priori to the mystery of all mysteries that we claim as ours for being humans—as Ashraful Mokhlukat—the best of all creations, and yet so low. A critique of sectarian convention, Lalon challenged the notion of social superiority in many of his songs. In one song, he sang, ""Everyone asks, what is Lalon's caste?'I've not seen what caste looks like,' Lalon says"" (author's translation). In another one, he made fun of those who freak out fearing contamination of race and caste. However, my most favorite is the one  where he denounced the world as a marketplace of the blind:""This is the bazaar of the blindBlind are the vedas and the doctrinesBlind also is my mind."" (author's translation)It is not only the fear of losing caste. It is the fear of losing blindness. It is the fear of light that haunts the blind. Those that are not afraid of light are not real; they can't be, because in this world and time, we are only awakened by death and darkness. We have lost our desire to see each other as equal humans; we fancy ourselves to be the judge of humankind because we are better than others, or because we are men or belong to those that are men. We read the invisibility of God as our sight/site of power and strength,  and we use that power to oppress women, nature,  and the  marginalized people of all genders, races, and ethnicities.  In our dying world,  we are in need of some light. We are in need of a centenarian singer of the soul named Lalon.Author, academic, and translator, Fayeza Hasanat teaches at the University of Central Florida, USA and occasionally writes for the Star Literature page."

We know what's on the line and for us that's a good feeling to have,"" he said.""Sri Lanka are a good team.

/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/does-dhaka-need-more-fashion-shows-3143401,Does Dhaka need more fashion shows?,"Fashion shows have always been a great platform for fashion designers to promote their couture houses. We often see glamorous international fashion shows on television or social media, but how often do our local fashion designers get the right podium? From an economic perspective if designers in Dhaka city offer more fashion shows it will generate a huge amount of revenue for our fashion industry. Fashion shows create numerous opportunities for brands, designers, models, photographers, editors, influencers, and celebrities. If we look into international fashion shows, nowadays, they are less open to the public and are generally organised by the brands or the authorised fashion bodies. Previously, fashion designers unveiled their latest collections via runway shows for their potential buyers and editors, but since 1993 when the New York Fashion Show took place, it has taken the international fashion industry to the next level. New York, Paris, Milan, and London all the famous fashion cities now offer fashion weeks. They bring out four different seasonal collections each year. Indian fashion designers also get to showcase their work via Lakme Fashion Week twice a year. Many fashion influencers visit these series of fashion events; it is a great way for purchasing haute couture and building your network within the industry.Bangladesh has a broad collection of quality handloom fabrics used by many well-established local designers. Our heritage designs and patterns are rich, sophisticated, sustainable, and most importantly handmade. Most fabrics are made from natural dyes, keeping in mind the environment, culture, and religion. The traditional Jamdani and Benaroshi saris are a huge part of our handloom woven culture, and if we as a fashion industry offer more fashion shows we will be able to promote our legacy even further. Many artisans work more than 180 hours behind each hand-embroidered sari or shalwar kameez. The practice of traditional motifs, nakshi kanthas, and block prints are all narrating beautiful stories about the history of Bangladeshi fashion, most of which are fading away due to the lack of exposure.Bangladeshi fashion designers who make handcrafted leather footwear and timeless jute bags could use the fashion shows to highlight their quality work to become global. Through this process, the long-lived tradition of handmade embroidery will stay alive. I believe it is always important to remember our brown roots and acknowledge our diverse bridal couture collections. Indian and Pakistani bridal collections are outstanding, but what if we have our own Bangladeshi bridal couture week? Now that is something to talk about and of course, it will help our customers to wear something made in Bangladesh for their special day. The rich heritage of Bangladeshi fabric can only grow through more fashion shows, digital media, and an eco-friendly environment. Fashion shows can be a tool for public awareness, they can create enthusiasm among the audience to purchase sustainable and reusable masterpieces. As our industry always battles against fast fashion and tries to create earth-friendly designer products. Fashion shows can help designers to reach out to more people and educate them to buy fewer but more valuable outfits. The moment you wear your grandmother's traditional sari at your university convocation, you are not only remembering her but also carrying the family heritage of being a brown child. It is like what Coco Chanel once said, ""Every day is a fashion show and the world is your runway""In recent years Instagram has been one of the biggest game changers for the fashion industry, many brands go live during their fashion shows to reach out to their followers directly. According to Forbes magazine, ""Social media provides all relevant guidance for the fashion shows nowadays, each post shared by celebrities creates a big impact on the designer's new collection."" In a recent Fendi fashion show they used throne to live telecast the entire show on social media. We have also seen Givenchy experience their fashion show with all plus-size models to grab the full attention of Gen Z. If we have more frequent fashion shows in Dhaka and promote them through Instagram, it will be a great source of constant connection between the designers and the customers. The shows can invite fashion experts and bloggers to associate with the global fashion market. It can provide a great place to meet new creative people who share the same passion, enabling a chance to view the hard work of our local fashion designers.In modern times fashion shows have become a piece of art, they work on the theme, stage, and choreography and hire a huge team for the production. If Dhaka offers more fashion shows there will be room for so many new job opportunities for creative younger graduates. Bangladeshi fashion industry deserves to be globally recognised and I believe more fashion shows will help us focus on our trademark designs, craftsmanship, and sustainability. "
/weekend-read/news/paperless-recruitment-can-make-difference-3143091,Paperless recruitment can make a difference ,"AKM Fahim Mahroor, CEO and co-founder of Bdjobs.com, a leading career management website of Bangladesh said, ""At present, many banks and private organisations are receiving and reviewing job applications through online platforms like Bdjobs.com. The submission process of the applications has become paperless and it saves a lot of money.""""Again,"" he added, ""many private organisations including banks are conducting job exams and interviews through online platforms like Bdjobs.com. Even the interviews and written exams of 20,000 to 30,000 candidates are being conducted virtually through our website.""He opined that taking online exams and interviews will reduce the expenditures significantly and ensure better transparency in the recruitment process.""Previously, banks used to spend Tk 300 to 400 per candidate to hold the job exams and interviews physically. Now, the banks who opted for online exams and interviews have to spend only Tk 15 to 20 per candidate. This ultimately saves a lot of money of the employers and employees as well as they don't have to travel or stay in another city just to attend the exams,"" said Fahim.""The government can also go for online recruitment process and it will increase transparency and accountability. Why a candidate is selected and why a candidate will not be called for the interview, everything will be done in a systematic manner and will be remained documented.""  "

The Council of Europe said the measure's vague definition of ""disinformation"" and accompanying threat of jail could have a ""chilling effect and increased self-censorship, not least in view of the upcoming elections in June 2023"".

It also allows the courts to sentence accredited reporters and regular social media users who ""openly spread misleading information"" to between one and three years in jail."
/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/doob-20-plea-save-the-citys-biodiversity-3143416,‘Doob 2.0’- A plea to save the city’s biodiversity,"The inauguration of 'Doob 2.0- a miniaturesque art exhibition' took place at the EMK Center, Dhanmondi 27, on September 24, 2022. Initiated by Azizee Fawmi Khan, Doob 2.0 is an attempt to point out the changes in our biodiversity caused by gradual urbanisation.Back in the 20th century, Dhaka city was a flourishing place with birds and other animals, and more green spaces. But alas! Our greed for built spaces has destroyed the natural beauty of the city. All we can see around us is a concrete jungle. The water bodies, the green areas, the birds and other small animals- they are hardly to be seen. The artists of Doob 2.0 bring us the images of the previous version of Dhaka versus the current one, blended with nostalgia and undying yearning.The miniaturesque pieces have filled the mini exhibition hall of EMK center. The first pair of artworks on the wall is called Leaf Story, Taniya Rahman Roshney's hand embroidery of houseplants on canvas, her fond memories of student life, and her friendship with nature. Mukta Mareeam Khan has used natural ingredients for her art piece, painting adorable frogs asking for rain on summer days. She was inspired by the folktales of her village and the folk song 'Ashare Golpo', that she sang herself.The cutest artwork I found was Arzina Ahasan's 'Unnoticed'. On her quest to frame unnoticed beauty of nature, the artist used grass, leaves, flowers, shells, and wooden scraps to recreate the biodiversity of her native village. Her work mainly focuses on portraying birds and plants, which she made permanent with resin.Another remarkable work is Nusrat Jahan Titly's 'Recreational Apiarist' is a memoir of her grandfather's love for bees.She wonders when was the last time a beehive formed naturally where she lives in. She used a wooden frame, recycles paper, and beads to form a beehive with intricate details. Sarah Jabin's 'Home Sweet Home' is a soap composite carving of columns from ancient civilisations, where she made little spaces to accommodate animals and birds.Afroza Hossain Sara used songs, drawing, and motions to hand-draw a digital animation of the cranes around Banani lake that, despite the pollution, population, and climate change. Ananya Mehpar Azad did a gorgeous portrayal of the goddess Dhakeshwari, the protector of Dhaka city, surrounded by her long lost rich biodiversity using fabric color and sequin embellishment on silk.Aside from these, all the other artists have produced remarkable art pieces that represent a desperate call for the protection of nature, along with their charming aesthetics. EMK Center will run this exhibition till October 22, 2022. "

All in all, we're not bad, just a little sharpen up would be nice.""Despite the series defeat and the gruelling lead-up to the World Cup, Finch said was confident his players would be ready for their tough opener.""We can't control what's already gone,"" he said.""We know how hard the guys train. Each person trained really well individually, and as a group, we trained fantastic.""It's just about guys peaking at the right time and not burning out too early.""

Our training to Bangladesh security forces promotes these very principles.""Replying to the journalist's query about freedom of speech in Bangladesh, he said, ""People everywhere, people anywhere have every right to use their voice, to assemble peacefully, to make their aspirations known in a way that is peaceful and respects the rule of law.""Bangladesh has been trying in different ways to make sure that the sanctions imposed on Rab are withdrawn.Peter Haas, US ambassador to Bangladesh, has maintained that they will not withdraw sanctions until accountability is ensured and reforms made to Rab."

/news/world/usa/news/us-capitol-riot-probe-lawmakers-vote-subpoena-trump-3143046,Us capitol riot probe: Lawmakers vote to subpoena Trump,"Lawmakers probing the 2021 attack on the US Capitol voted on Thursday to subpoena former president Donald Trump to testify on his role in the violence, in a major escalation of the sprawling enquiry weeks before it is due to wind up.During what was expected to be its final hearing before the midterm elections, the House panel of seven Democrats and two Republicans agreed unanimously to compel Trump's appearance before investigators.""We need to be fair and thorough and gain a full context for the evidence we've obtained. But the need for this committee to hear from Donald Trump goes beyond our fact-finding,"" said Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the committee.""This is a question about accountability to the American people. He must be accountable. He is required to answer for his actions.""Subpoenas from the panel have proved difficult to enforce, with former White House aide Steve Bannon the only target yet convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply.Trump is notorious for his ability to run down the clock on congressional investigations and legal action, and it remains highly unlikely that he would agree to give evidence.""Why didn't the Unselect Committee ask me to testify months ago? Why did they wait until the very end, the final moments of their last meeting?"" thundered Trump, who has had a standing invitation to appear before the committee.Reacting on his right-wing Truth Social platform, Trump said the committee was a ""total 'BUST' that has only served to further divide our Country.""Any subpoena would expire in any case with the new congressional term in January. Control of the House of Representatives is expected to flip after November elections to the Republicans, who plan to immediately end the investigation.But the move marks an aggressive escalation of the probe, which has issued more than 100 subpoenas and interviewed more than 1,000 people since its inception in 2021.While no sitting president has ever been forced to testify before Congress, lawmakers have summoned former presidents to discuss their conduct in office.Trump didn't say whether he would testify, but if he refuses to comply, the full House can hold him in criminal contempt in a vote recommending him for prosecution.The vote came as a spectacular coda to an already stunning hearing in which the committee offered fresh evidence that Trump had planned to declare victory in the 2020 election -- regardless of the outcome.Trump had a ""premeditated plan"" formulated months before the vote to claim he had won on election night, whatever the vote tally showed, panel member Zoe Lofgren told the hearing, citing evidence gathered by the committee.Across eight hearings in the summer the panel unveiled reams of evidence on the former president's involvement in a labyrinthine series of connected schemes to overturn the election.Blockbuster witness testimony in June and July provided stunning examples of Trump and his allies pressuring election officials and trying to get lawfully-cast votes nullified in swing states, and of Trump's inertia amid the mob uprising.Lawmakers plan to release a final report by the end of the year, although preliminary findings could be announced before November's midterm elections.The committee has not announced formally whether it will make direct criminal referrals over January 6, although several members see the issue as moot, since the Justice Department is already investigating."

With the deathwatch beetle following her everywhere, Jet knows that her time has come. In her late 80s, Jet is a kind, warm woman, trying her best to help those in need. Yet, her life seems unfulfilled and there is one last thing she needs to take care of before embracing death. What is it, then, that is bothering a woman in this seemingly late chapter of her life?As Alice Hoffman unfolds the story in this book and brings an end to her The Practical Magic (Simon Schuster, 2020) series, readers find the enchanted Owens women embarking on a menacing journey that involves coming in close contact with the Dark side or ""left-handed"" magic, as the author puts it.An adventurous young adult read, full of enchantments, emotions, and familial bond, The Book of Magic (Simon & Schuster, 2021) is something readers might relish if they are looking to read in the supernatural/fantasy genre. Set across the United States of America and England, the book follows the mystical Owens women who have set out on a journey in order to break a curse that has steered their lives for centuries. Whoever they fall in love with meets with an untimely death. How can one bear to live while a loved one is perishing right in front of their eyes? The readers confront such questions throughout the entire novel that connects them to the storyline easily. As the narrative unfolds, the writer tells of a curse that has loomed over the family members for centuries, and Jet Owens sets off on a mission to end it while the deathwatch beetle keeps clicking away. She goes to the library and seeks out ""The Book of the Raven"", a book that holds the key to ending the notorious curse. Yet, the path is as difficult as can be since the one who embarks upon it will lose something precious. While Jet breathes her last and is buried beside her childhood sweetheart, a series of tragic events take place in the Owens family. Gideon, the love of Kylie's life, is met with a sudden accident. As he is lying in the hospital bed battling for his life, Kylie realises that the abrupt catastrophe and Gideon's critical condition are all but a work of the curse. She sets out on a dangerous journey to rectify their circumstances and quickly finds herself in a place where Gideon's isn't the only life hanging by a thread.The familial bond portrayed in the novel makes it easy to sympathise with the characters and they rarely seem woven in a piece of fiction; rather, their attributes are more lifelike and one may just find someone like Franny or Gillian Owens among their kith and kin. However, the family line in the novel can be a little difficult to decipher and the descriptions sometimes come off as too dense. Nonetheless, Alice Hoffman weaves the ending well and The Book of Magic is perhaps some sort of a closure, being the last one in the series of four.Shejuti Pasha loves reading along with a cup of coffee.

/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/how-build-capsule-wardrobe-3143396,How to build a capsule wardrobe,"If you have been following the fashion influencer or the lifestyle influencer scene on the Internet in the past few years, you must have come across the term ""capsule wardrobe"". Below, we describe everything there is to know about capsule wardrobes for both men and women, including the steps to developing a capsule wardrobe and items to purchase. A capsule wardrobe is simply a collection of clothing composed of thoughtfully curated, easily interchangeable items designed to maximise the number of outfits that you can create. These pieces will create a strong foundation for your entire collection. These are minimal, comfortable, classic, and timeless pieces that will go with everything else you own and can be worn again and again. The items will be carefully and intentionally selected to provide purpose to your lifestyle. I'm sure you have experienced the ""I have nothing to wear despite my closet overflowing"" phenomenon at least once in your life. Often, we end up purchasing random pieces that just collect dust in our closets as it becomes difficult to integrate those into our everyday lives. Having a capsule wardrobe saves us from this decision fatigue. Decision fatigue is the weary feeling you get after being faced with too many decisions, affecting your decision-making choices, and the quality of the process. Having a curated wardrobe makes it easier to pick outfits for any occasion, saving time shopping, deciding what to wear, and reducing stress. It also allows you to discover and develop your personal style. A capsule wardrobe is also very sustainable and wallet-friendly. As you purchase high-quality items, that serve a purpose to your style and life, you end up wearing and re-wearing every piece, with nothing going to waste. Buying fewer items allows you to save up money for the more important things in life. It also reduces your carbon footprint. Before you start building a capsule wardrobe, keep in mind that it is a fairly slow process and takes about 2-3 years to build and perfect. You are not expected to build the wardrobe overnight. Do not be too stressed about it, it is an exercise to help you be more conscious, not a punishment. You should have a capsule wardrobe for each of the seasons. If you reside in Dhaka, having two capsule wardrobes – one for summer and one for winter will work just fine. Assess everything in your wardrobe. Try them on, see if they fit you, if you like them and if they flatter you. Ask yourself when is the last time you wore this item. The goal is to analyse and find out what you gravitate towards and what you never touch. Set aside clothes that do not fit you anymore, that do not work for you anymore, and that you do not need. Get rid of clothes that are stained, damaged, and worn out beyond repair. Divide your finding into the three following parts: if a piece works for you but not for this season – place it in storage. If the piece does not work for you – sell or give it away. Pieces that work for you but you have not worn them out as much – give them a 3-month trial period. If you own multiple items which are similar in nature, keep one and remove the others. Another way to find out what you wear regularly, turn all your coat hangers to face the same way, then every time you wear something, turn it around. By the end of the month, you will have a good sense of the wardrobe heroes that you cannot live without as these are the pieces you should be basing your capsule around. Make sure to donate your decluttered or sell them second-hand, to ensure that the clothes reach those who need them, getting a second life.  It is time to chalk out a plan for your wardrobe. First, decide on the number of clothing you would like to own. While people decide on various numbers ranging from 26-37, you do not have to stick to such numbers. Just make sure you do not go overboard with your shopping for the capsule. Create an ideal shopping list, and compare it with your closet to find gaps. Your wish list should be consistent with your personal taste, style, how you spend most of your time and lifestyle. When you go to purchase something, make a mental note of what you are going to wear it with. This will help you build outfits instead of having pretty individual pieces. Remember, you are dressing for your actual life, not for some moments. Think about your goals, values, and intention behind the pieces. Always invest in quality pieces that will last years and fix your budget accordingly. This is by no means an exhaustive list and you can modify it depending on your needs. Your capsule is also not the ""end all, be all"". You can elevate it over the years and tap into the trends. Avoid buying into fads that will be out of fashion in a short time. Invest in trends that will last a few seasons. In order to take it slow, just plan in detail for the upcoming season, then edit and transition between each season. Choose pieces that are both functional and versatile. consider how easily it can be mixed and matched with other pieces, colours, and patterns, and whether you can wear it to different events or in different seasons.A neutral colour palette that includes black, white, grey, navy, beige, and cream is very versatile, allowing you to wear more colours with intention and weave different clothing genres together to create seamless looks. One way of incorporating colours is to select 2-3 accent colours per season to include in your seasonal capsule. Solid colours, which are not too muted or bright can be very versatile. Play around with textures, fabrics, and sizes too. Experimenting with different cuts, silhouettes, and sleeve styles adds a unique flair to your outfits. There is room to add prints to your wardrobe. Choose from classic prints like stripes, navy stripes, houndstooth, polka dots, and some iterations of plaids and checks. Just because Miranda Priestly from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was not impressed with florals for spring, does not mean you cannot have florals for spring and summer. Floral prints, whether big or small are always amazing for the summer and spring in blouses, dresses, and Kurtis. Do not view a capsule wardrobe as something restrictive. It is in fact quite the opposite. While the capsule wardrobe is meant to serve you for years to come, you can definitely edit and elevate it as you go. Just do not go down the rabbit hole of mindless shopping when adding things to your closet. Happy shopping! "
