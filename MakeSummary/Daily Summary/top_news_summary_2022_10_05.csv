North Korea in 2017 also tested missiles capable of hitting the continental United States.North Korea has fired nearly 40 ballistic missiles over about 20 different launch events this year, exploiting Russia's war on Ukraine and the resulting deep divide in the UN Security Council to accelerate its arms development without risking further sanctions.Its aim is to develop a fully fledged nuclear arsenal capable of threatening the US mainland and its allies while gaining recognition as a nuclear state and wresting concessions from those countries.The United States, Britain, France, Albania, Norway and Ireland called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council over the latest North Korean launch.

/youth/education/news/no-campus-housing-most-public-univ-teachers-3135481,No on-campus housing for most public univ teachers,"A staggering 78 percent of public university teachers have no on-campus residential facilities, hampering their daily activities like taking classes or doing research work.According to the latest annual report of the University Grants Commission, only 22 percent of 15,426 public universities have on-campus housing for teachers.UGC officials said the lack of campus residences for teachers has been a long-standing problem.In 2016, 77 percent of the public universities did not have such facilities, and in 2011 it was 75 percent, they said.
Teachers also pointed out that as most of them stay outside the campus, interactions with students are not satisfactory.Those who have to live outside the campus also have to spend a large part of their salaries on house rent.They also had to spend extra time and money on commuting to and from university.Many teachers alleged they had to unwillingly join ""teacher politics"" or had to have ""good connections with ruling party-backed teacher organisations"" in order to get residential facilities or have an apartment allotted to them.Prof Nizamul Hoque Bhuiyan, general secretary of the Federation of Bangladesh University Teachers Association, said if a teacher can have on-campus housing, they can reach classes on time.Teachers and other university officials, like provosts and tutors, living in metropolitan cities suffer the most as commuting through traffic renders them unable to respond quickly to emergency situations, said Nizamul, also the GS of Dhaka University Teachers' Association.Against this backdrop, the country is observing World Teachers' Day today with the theme -- ""The Transformation of Education Begins with Teachers"".Since 1994, the World Teachers' Day is observed annually to celebrate the contribution of teachers around the globe.It is a day to celebrate how teachers are transforming education but also to reflect on the support they need to fully deploy their talent and vocation, and to rethink the way ahead for the profession globally.Former UGC chairman AK Azad Chowdhury said that on-campus housing for teachers offers numerous benefits to both teachers and students and could help develop their interaction.Teachers will be able to spend more time on their research and guide students' researches, said Azad, also former vice chancellor of Dhaka University.Contacted, UGC Secretary Ferdous Zaman said a teacher of a public university in Dhaka gets 50 percent of house rent included in their salaries, while those in divisional cities get 45 percent and teachers in district towns get 40.

""I cultivate the fish in 65 ponds and they are cheaper to produce compared to varieties of carp,"" he added.Rony also produces fish fry that are supplied to different districts of the country, including Rajshahi, Natore, Sirajganj and Sylhet.Sabuj Mia of Guilakanda village and Tajul Islam of Dekuarcahr village in Iswarganj upazila also expressed satisfaction over their cultivation of small indigenous fish.They said native breeds are more disease resistant than other varieties and thanked the BFRI for its all-out support.The two fish farmers then said they saw a marked rise in production after adopting modern techniques from the institute.The BFRI established a ""live gene bank"" for the conservation of small indigenous fish in 2020 and so far, 102 species have been included.

/business/economy/news/apparel-export-can-hit-95b-2030-riding-mmf-3135196,Apparel export can hit $95b  by 2030 riding on MMF,"Apparel exports from Bangladesh will cross $95 billion by 2030 if the country can expand its share in the global market for manmade fibre (MMF) to 12 per cent from less than 5 per cent at present, according to a recent study.MMF apparel items accounted for $222 billion of the $440 billion global garments market last year, when cotton-based products contributed $190 billion.As such, almost half of all apparel exports worldwide are of MMF products while 42 per cent are cotton-based garment items.However, the picture is reverse in Bangladesh, where 72 per cent of the garment exports are cotton-based apparels and just 24 per cent are MMF, the study said.Of the total $42 billion apparel exports from Bangladesh in the last fiscal year, $30 billion were cotton-based garment items Of the total $42 billion apparel exports from Bangladesh in the last fiscal year, $30 billion were cotton-based garment items Mohammad Abdur Razzaque, research director of the Policy Research Institute (PRI) and author of the study, presented the outcomes at a programme on ""Man-made fibres for moving up the apparel value chain in the context of LDC graduation"".The event was organised by the planning ministry at the National Economic Council auditorium in Dhaka yesterday.Of the total $42 billion apparel exports from Bangladesh in the last fiscal year, $30 billion were cotton-based garment items.Bangladesh already accounts for 16 per cent of all cotton apparel shipments worldwide and the country will soon become the largest cotton-based garments exporter as China, the largest supplier at present, has been losing its market share.Global MMF apparel exports grew by 4 per cent while that of cotton-based items shrunk by 0.5 per cent annually between 2011 and 2019.Cotton apparel exports then fell by some 15 per cent in 2020 while MMF garment shipments saw robust growth of 8 per cent in 2021.The share of MMF apparel exports from China increased from 37 per cent of the country's total garment shipments in 2010 to 74 per cent in 2021.Similarly, the share of MMF apparel shipments rose to 57 per cent from 38 per cent in Vietnam, 32 per cent from 15 per cent in India, and 26 per cent from 13 per cent in Cambodia at the same time.Meanwhile, the share of MMF garments sent from Bangladesh increased to 24 per cent from 18 per cent of the country's apparel exports during the period, the study said.The global demand for MMF-based apparel items has been growing because of uncertainty in cotton production and supply, price comparability, and certain advantages offered by such products, namely higher durability, water and wrinkle resistance, and colour retention.Other reasons include environmental concerns, the fact that 2,700 litres of water are needed to produce a single cotton t-shirt, use of pesticides in growing cotton, and plastic recycling advantage of MMF.Global fibre production stood at 109 million tonnes in 2020, when manmade synthetic fibres accounted for 68 per cent (close to 80 million tonnes).
MMF production worldwide is expected to reach about 110 million tonnes, by 2030, when the market will be worth around $100 billion compared to $62.7 in 2021.To tap into this market, Bangladesh needs to build its backward linkage capacity, Razzaque said.MMF currently comprises around 30 per cent of Bangladesh's total fibre imports with China being the largest source.Razzaque then suggested making the most of the few remaining years that Bangladesh will enjoy trade benefits as a least developed country (LDC) by offering additional cash incentives for MMF apparel exports and attract foreign investment in the sector so that the country becomes a regional supply hub.Planning Minister MA Mannan said the government has been considering paying more cash incentive to MMF-based apparel exporters as the garment sector is considered a strong component to address the challenges of LDC graduation.However, he did not say exactly how much the cash incentive would be increased as local manufacturers have already demanded 10 per cent cash incentives on export receipts of MMF to grab more of the global market share and attract foreign and local investment in the sector.The minister also said the cash incentive given on export receipts should be disbursed equally as other sectors deserve equal benefits.

/environment/natural-resources/energy/news/half-the-country-blacked-out-3135131,Blackout hits half the country,"The country yesterday suffered the worst power outage in eight years, which, according to officials, was triggered by a trip at a substation in Ghorashal.It disrupted industrial production, water supplies and telecommunication services in more than half the country.Millions suffered in sweltering heat as most areas in Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet, and Mymensingh divisions were left without electricity for up to eight hours from 2:00pm.Besides, there were uncertainties as to when  power would be restored as the authorities didn't issue any detailed statement clearing up things until around 6:00pm.A spokesperson for Bangladesh Power Development Board said around 10:00pm that engineers were able to restore the electricity supply in 90 percent of the affected areas.As of 12:30am, power disruptions were still being reported in some parts of the capital.The power, energy, and mineral resources ministry in a statement last night said power supply started getting restored in some areas of Dhaka after 5:15pm.Power Division Secretary Habibur Rahman said the problem began at a substation near Ghorashal when the demand for electricity suddenly dropped, causing a power surge that tripped power stations one after another.
""We will be able to come up with the exact cause very soon,"" he told The Daily Star.A power trip happens when an electrical circuit gets a load beyond its capacity, according to experts.Prominent energy expert Prof M Shamsul Alam said the National Load Dispatch Centre, which is supposed to coordinate the generation, transmission and distribution of power, often remains helpless because it is not provided with proper data by power generators and distributors.When the dispatch centre fails to ensure coordination, a risk of grid failure arises.If the voltage is not controlled, the electrical frequency cannot be controlled, and when the frequency rises or falls beyond a certain range, power stations trip one after another.Also, the frequency stability should be controlled automatically, but it is done manually here, he said.The Power Grid Company Bangladesh (PGCB) last night formed a five-member committee to find out what caused the failure and asked it to come up with its findings by Friday.Contacted, Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, said, ""It was a grid failure.
